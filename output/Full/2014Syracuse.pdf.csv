Internships may be taken during any semester or summer session. Career Services facilitates internships in most career areas and makes informationabout internship options available to graduate and undergraduate students from across the University. Students who want to receive academic credit for theirinternship are subject to the provisions and regulations of the school or college in which they are enrolled.Elective internships can provide students with opportunities to apply what they have learned in the classroom, explore career options, develop specificcareer skills, and become involved with community service. The specific role of the intern varies with each host organization, depending upon the student’sgoals, objectives, and skills and the organization’s needs and resources. Supervisors in the host organization guide and monitor the intern’s work at the internship site. If the internship is taken for academic credit, then at theend of the internship the supervisor evaluates each intern’s work. This becomes part of the faculty member's final evaluation of student achievement.Every academic credit internship is guided by a faculty sponsor, a faculty member who has expertise relevant to the internship. The sponsor helps thestudent set goals for the internship and decides on the method of evaluating the experience. Interns may be required to keep journals, complete portfolios,or work on projects and papers. The faculty sponsor also awards the grade for the internship.INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIESStudents can find pre-existing internships in many fields. In addition students can often develop their own internships, each of which must be approved bytheir faculty sponsor and academic program. Internships may be taken during the fall or spring semester, over winter break or during summer sessions,either in the Syracuse area, elsewhere in the United States or abroad. ACADEMIC CREDITOnce accepted for an internship, students must complete a learning proposal that describes the goals and activities planned for the internship and an onlinesupplemental information (and waiver) form. Internships for elective academic credit require at least 45 hours of internship work for each credit earned. Thus, during a regular 15-week semester, anintern may earn three credits by working an average of 9 hours a week. During summer sessions, work schedules vary widely and often include more than theminimum number of hours. All internship hours worked under the oversight of the faculty sponsor are considered part of the internship.  THe number ofcredits are determined by the specific department, school or college in which a student is enrolled.  On average students register between 1 and 6 credits. Work schedules are arranged by the interns and their site supervisors. The total number of credits awarded depends upon the nature of the tasks andresponsibilities involved as well as the number of hours worked and in summer, the student’s financial resources.During fall and spring semesters, full-time undergraduate students may include internship course credits as part of their regular course load, which allows upto 19 credits without incurring additional tuition charges. Undergraduates accepted for summer sessions internships pay tuition at the rate set for othersummer credits. All graduate students and all University college students taking internships for credit pay tuition at the rates set for other credits.Interns must be registered during the semester or summer session in which their internships take place. Retroactive credit is not granted.For further information about local and national internship opportunities, program policies, and application and registration procedures, contact the CareerServices office in Schine Student Center, or visit the Career Services web site, http://careerservices.syr.edu . Interdisciplinary And Specialized StudySyracuse University has long promoted the development of special programs and research groups, many of an interdisciplinary nature. Not only doesSyracuse offer a wide array of interdisciplinary programs of study, but many individual courses provide students with considerable flexibility in developingtheir academic programs. Students enrolled in certain programs at Syracuse may also take selected courses at one of the two SUNY institutions adjacent to8the campus, the College of Environmental Science and Forestry and SUNY Upstate Medical University. Detailed descriptions and requirements of theseprograms are given in the appropriate colleges’ and schools’ listings in this catalog.The interdisciplinary network at Syracuse also encompasses faculty members who serve in dual capacities, holding joint appointments in more than onedepartment within the University or at other institutions. For example, some School of Education faculty members regularly instruct classes in the MaxwellSchool of Citizenship and Public Affairs and vice versa. Other faculty members hold external appointments in addition to their posts at the University.Graduate StudyGenerally, graduate students select a program of study within one academic unit that leads to a degree conferred by the Graduate School. Students may alsochoose to pursue formal joint-degree programs. In such cases, the student is enrolled in more than one school or college. A dually enrolled student mustmeet the major requirements in each school. Examples of dual programs are the law/public administration (J.D./M.P.A.) program, the law/library science(J.D./M.S.)  program, the law/business administration (J.D./M.B.A) program., and the law/cultural foundations of education (J.D./M.S) program,  law/forensicscience (J.D./M.A.), and law/computer science (J.D./M.S.).Similar in concept to joint degree programs are concurrent degree programs, which also allow students to pursue programs of study in more than onediscipline simultaneously, often with fewer total credit requirements than the two separate degrees. This plan leads to two degrees, one in each program ofstudy. Concurrent degree arrangements are  also available to Syracuse University graduate students and SUNY College of Environmental Science andForestry students who wish to combine the study of public administration, law, management, education, or public communications with study inenvironmental science and forestry.Similarly, The Master of Public Health (M.P.H) degree is a collaborative program, sponsored jointly by SUNY Upstate Medical University (UMU) andSyracuse University (SU). Participating colleges at Syracuse University include the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs, the College of HumanEcology, L.C. Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science, and the College of Law.Under the terms of a formal Scholar Exchange Program, Syracuse graduate students may avail themselves, for up to one year of study, of classes offered byCornell University or the University of Rochester in addition to the courses and programs offered by Syracuse University. The CASE CenterThe Center for Advanced Systems and Engineering (CASE) is a NYSTAR-designated Center for Advanced Technology (CAT) funded by New YorkState to support innovative, interdisciplinary research in complex information-intensive systems. CASE's mission is to catalyze growth in the state's high-technology economy providing expertise in applications related to complex behavioral, information, and communication systems. CASE’s currenttechnical focus areas include cognitive wireless communication, data fusion, data mining, command and control, security and assurance, bioinformatics,intelligent computing, and sensor network/management. These focus areas change and expand often as CASE engages new faculty and industry partners.CASE also facilitates university-industry collaborative research; brings together interdisciplinary teams from industry and academia to foster innovation;identifies funding opportunities and assists in developing and delivering successful proposals and projects.CASE serves as an access point for industry to engage the University, supporting co-op and internship programs for students as well as sponsored researchprojects. Through CASE, graduate students with a variety of backgrounds can work with advanced information research and technology. In addition to closecollaborations with faculty scientists and engineers, CASE offers students opportunities to gain practical real-world experience working directly with leadingprivate sector companies in a wide range of industries. For students interested in entrepreneurship, CASE also offers a unique chance to participate first-hand in the launch of high-potential start-up companies through its on-campus incubator. A CASE experience can significantly enhance students’professional development and career options.The Graduate SchoolBen Ware, DeanGabrielle Chapman, Associate Dean 207 Bowne Hall, 315-443-2543gradsch.syr.edugrad@syr.eduGraduate study and research have been recognized as a critical piece of Syracuse University’s mission since its inception in 1870. Today, every school andcollege at Syracuse offers graduate study, and the University awards approximately 1,700 master’s degrees and certificates of advanced study and 150doctoral degrees annually. A complete listing of graduate degree programs can be found in the Academic Offerings Tab section in this catalog.Individual graduate programs are administered by departments or interdisciplinary committees and are subject to approval by the appropriate schools andcolleges and by the University Senate. These policies and standards are administered by the Graduate School. All postbaccalaureate degrees are awardedthrough the Graduate School, with the exception of the J.D. degree, which is awarded through the College of Law.Graduate students will learn from a full-time faculty of more than 800 scholars, many of them internationally or nationally recognized in their field, andwill assist faculty both in the classroom and with important research initiatives.All Syracuse University graduate degree programs, with the exception of law, are organized under the auspices of the Graduate School. Applications foradmission are submitted to the Graduate School, which also confers degrees upon graduation. The graduate degree programs themselves, however, are offeredby faculty of the University’s 12 academic schools and colleges. This unique organizational structure fosters intellectual collaboration and explorationacross the disciplines while at the same time recognizing the highly specialized nature of graduate-level academic work.9Requests for information about graduate programs should be directed to the specific academic units offering those programs. Questions about University-wide policies should be directed to the Graduate School.Syracuse University Graduation RateIn compliance with the federal Student-Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act, and regulations of the U.S. Department of Education, Syracuse Universityprovides the following information to current and prospective students:  Of the cohort of full-time degree-seeking undergraduate students who first enrolledat Syracuse University in fall 2007, 81.1 percent had earned their bachelor’s degrees as of August 2013.  These beginning and end dates comprise 150percent of the normal length of full-time study (4 years) needed to complete a typical undergraduate degree program. While this calculation meets the act’srequirements for determining a graduation rate, Syracuse University recognizes that many students for diverse reasons are unable or choose not to completetheir degrees in a continuous sequence of full-time enrollment and, therefore, that the rate may not accurately reflect the commitment and achievement ofits students. Moreover, the act’s stipulation that the graduation rate be that of the cohort of entering full-time students leaves out the significantpopulation of part-time students who constitute an important part of the Syracuse University community.Adjunct Faculty And Teaching AssistantsADJUNCT FACULTY BY SCHOOL, DEPARTMENT, OR DIVISION  A & S - Curriculum/Instruction2A & S - Writing Program4African-American Studies4Architecture6Art & Music Histories1Arts & Sciences - Honors19Biology3BMC Engineering1Civil & Envirnmtal Engineering4Communication Rhetorical Study4Communication Sciences & Dis3Counseling & Human Services3Cultural Fndtn-Intergrp Dialog1Cultural Foundations Ed Curric2CVPA-Drama19CVPA-Foundation10CVPA-School of Music42Department of Art at Comart5Department of Art at Shaffer6Ed-Instructional Technology3Ed-Teaching & Leadership7Ed-Teach & Ldrship-Art Eductn1Ed-Teach & Ldrship Math1Ed-Teach & Ldrship Music1Elec Eng & Computer Science7English1Exercise Science24FALK Child & Family Studies5FALK Food Studies1FALK Marriage & Family Therapy2FALK Nutrition Sci & Dietetics3FALK Public Health1FALK Social Work13Fashion & Design Technology210Forensic Science Institute5History1Information Studies-Dean36International Relatns-Wash DC2Languages, Lit & Linguistics26Law College12Mathematics12Maxwell Dean's Office3Mech and Aerospace Engineering2Moynihan Institute1Philosophy2Psychology6Public Admin & International Affairs3Public Affairs1Public Communications31Public Communciations - SULA4School of Design14School of Management22Sociology2Transmedia Studies11UC Summer Programs Faculty1University College-Fin Stdt Sp2University College-SCP Gen Ad15TA'S BY SCHOOL, DEPARTMENT, OR DIVISION A & S - Curriculum/Instruction 4A & S - Women's Studies 3A & S - Writing Program 20AASC 1African-American Studies 8Anthropology 14Architecture 31Art & Music Histories 4Biology 25BMC Engineering 12CVPA-Foundation 8CVPA-School of Design 1CVPA-School of Music 15Chemistry 61Civil & Environmental Engineering 13Communication Rhetorical Study 10Communication Sciences & Dis 3Counseling & Human Services 7Cultural Foundations Ed Curric 6Department of Art at Comart 14Department of Art at Shaffer 611Earth Sciences 23Economics 29Ed-Instructional Technology 4Ed-Teaching & Leadership 13Ed-Teach & Ldrship-Art Eductn 2Ed-Teach & Ldrship Math 1Ed-Teach & Ldrship Music 2Ed-Teach & Ldrship Sci Teach 4Elec Eng & Computer Science 35Engineering-Dean's Office 1English 47Exercise Science 9FALK BMW Child Dev.

FERPA givesstudents certain rights with respect to their education records.  These rights include:I. The right to inspect and review the student’s education records.Students should submit to the University Registrar (106 Steele Hall, Syracuse University, Syracuse, "
NY 1324,"4-1120) a written request that identifies therecord(s) they wish to inspect. The University Registrar will make arrangements for access, excluding records and documents considered exceptions or towhich a student has waived his or her right of access, and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.  Access will beprovided within a reasonable time, not to exceed 45 days after the Registrar’s receipt of the student’s request.II. The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading, or inviolation of the student’s privacy rights.Students who wish to ask the University to amend a record  should obtain a Request to Amend or Remove Education Records form from the Registrar’sOffice and clearly identify the part of the record they want changed and specify why it is inaccurate, misleading or in violation of their rights of privacy.Note that this does not include a right to contest grades or other substantive matters accurately reflected in the records.  Thus, this procedure may not beused to change a grade in a record unless the grade assigned was inaccurately recorded.If the University decides not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify the student in writing of the decision and of the student’s right toa hearing regarding the request for amendment.   Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when he or she isnotified of the right to a hearing.  If the hearing results in a final determination not to amend the record, the student is permitted to place a statement withthe record commenting on the contested information, stating his or her disagreement with the decision not to amend the record, or both.III. The right to provide written consent before the University  discloses personally identifiable information from the student’s educationrecords, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.A student has the right to consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information contained in his or her education records, except to the extentthat FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.  Set forth below is information about some of the circumstances in which FERPA authorizes suchdisclosures.  The University reserves the right to make disclosures of information from education records without a student’s consent in these and othercircumstances in which such disclosures are permitted by FERPA.  A.            The University may disclose education records without a student's prior written consent to school officials with legitimate educational interests.  A school official is:1. a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research or support staff position;2. a person or company with whom the University has contracted  (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent);3. a person serving on the Board of Trustees; 4. a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his orher tasks; or5. a person volunteering or otherwise performing services for the University.A school official has a “legitimate educational interest” when he, she, or it has a need to access student education records for the purpose of performing anappropriate educational, research, administrative or other function for the University. B. The University may disclose education records without consent to officials of another university, college or school in which a student seeks or intends toenroll, or is already enrolled, for purposes of the student’s enrollment or transfer.C. The University may disclose education records without consent to parents of a dependent student as defined by the Internal Revenue Service, when proofof dependency has been provided. A “parent” is a parent, guardian, or someone acting as a parent who meets the IRS standard. (Note: Students should referto their individual school/college policies concerning parental notification of information regarding academic misconduct and/or academic performance.)D. The University may disclose education records without consent to appropriate parties in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the informationis necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals.IV. The right to prevent disclosure of personally identifiable information that Syracuse University has designated as “Directory Information.”Unless a student has followed the steps described below, the University may disclose “directory information” without consent in accordance with theprovisions of FERPA. Directory information is defined as that information which would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy ifdisclosed. Syracuse University considers the following to be directory information:14Name*Current address and phone numberPermanent address and phone numberSU email address*Academic awards and honorsAthletic participationClass/level*Dates of attendanceDegree(s) earned and date(s)Full/part-time statusMajors(s)/degree program(s)Photograph or other visual imagePrior postsecondary institutions attendedSU ID numberSU school/college(s)* * Asterisked items are displayed in the University’s online directoryStudents may block the public disclosure of directory information (in whole or in part) by filing a Request to Prevent Disclosure of Directory Informationform with the Office of the Registrar, 106 Steele Hall. Requests may be filed at any time, and remain in effectpermanently (including after departure fromthe University) until removed, in writing, by the student. The Registrar’s Office will provide information about additional steps that must be taken bystudents who wish to prevent release of information regarding athletic participation and announcements of academic achievements to their hometownnewspaper(s).Filing of a Request to Prevent Disclosure will also prevent information from loading to Blackboard, an online course management system used in many SUclasses, and may make a student ineligible for SUmail, SU's student e-mail system. For such students who are required to use Blackboard for one or moreclasses,  the Registrar’s Office will provide information about the additional steps that must be taken. Instead of SUmail, those who file a Request toPrevent Disclosure that includes their SU e-mail address will be provided an official SU e-mail account in the University's administrative e-mail system.Students should carefully consider the consequences of a decision to prevent disclosure of Directory Information. Regardless of the effect upon students, theUniversity assumes no liability as a result of honoring instructions that such information be withheld.V. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Syracuse University to comply with therequirements of FERPA.Any student who has reason to believe that the University is not complying with FERPA should inform the University Registrar in writing. The Registrarshall promptly review all such allegations and initiate appropriate actions.  In addition, students have the right to file complaints with the United StatesDepartment of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.  Complaints may be submitted inwriting to: Family Policy Compliance OfficeU.S. Department of Education400 Maryland Avenue, SWWashington 4-1120, 315 443-2422.---------------------------------Related Policy:  Computer Law ( from item VII of  SU Computing and Electronic Communications Policy)Under Article 156 of the New York State Penal Code, criminal sanctions are imposed for offenses involving computers, software, and computer data.

Distance Learning Students - InformationRegistration of Distance ProgramsSyracuse University’s degree and certificate programs delivered through distance education are registered with the New York State Education Department(NYSED).  In addition to NYSED, some other states’ governing agencies require registration of our distance programs.  We are in the process of registeringour programs in those states. 15MarylandSyracuse University is in the process of registering its distance education programs with the Maryland Higher Education Commission.Distance Learning Complaint Process for Out-of-State StudentsPursuant to the United States Department of Education’s Program Integrity Rule, Syracuse University is required to provide all prospective and currentstudents with the contact information of the state agency or agencies that handle complaints against postsecondary education institutions offering distancelearning or correspondence education within that state.Students residing in other states while enrolled in a course offered by Syracuse University are encouraged to utilize Syracuse University’s internal complaintor review policies and procedures, typically initiated within the academic department of the school or college offering the course, prior to filing a complaintwith the state agency or agencies. However, if the complaint is not resolved through these processes, a student may use the following list (current as of May2014) to identify the office(s) to which a complaint may be filed in the state in which the student resides.

Campus Safety It is Syracuse University's policy to provide anyone, on request, with a printed copy of the University's policies and procedures regarding campus securityand safety, as well as crime rates and statistics for the most recent three-year period. A copy of Your Safety and Security at Syracuse University, ahandbook that provides this information, is available from DPS. The handbook is updated annually.The Syracuse Unversity Department of Public Safety will provide upon request all campus crime statistics as reported to the United States Department ofEducation.US DOE website:  http://ope.ed.gov/security/20Academic RulesThis is the official version of the general academic rules of Syracuse University (SU) effective for the 2014-2015 academic year. The rules are presentedalphabetically by topic, reflecting distinctions between undergraduate and graduate rules as appropriate. Both undergraduate and graduate students will findthat their individual school/college/department has additional rules that apply. In the case of graduate students, these rules may be more restrictive than thegeneral University rule.Additional Sources For InformationThere are a number of other sources for information and rules that are important for students. They include, but are not limited to, the following:Financial Aid Home Student HandbookSU AbroadTuition, Fees & Related PoliciesAlso see school, college, and academic department materials and websites.Academic IntegrityAt Syracuse University, academic integrity is expected of every community member in all endeavors. Academic integrity includes a commitment to thevalues of honesty, trustworthiness, fairness, and respect. These values are essential to the overall success of an academic society. In addition, each memberof the university community has a right to expect the highest standards of academic integrity from all other community members. An individual’s academicdishonesty threatens and undermines the central mission of the University. It is unfair to other community members who do not cheat, because it devaluesefforts to learn, to teach, and to conduct research. Academic dishonesty interferes with moral and intellectual development, and poisons the atmosphere ofopen and trusting intellectual discourse. Syracuse University’s academic integrity policy and procedures are administered by the Academic Integrity Office inthe Division of Academic Affairs, and all schools and colleges (see supplemental policy and procedures for the College of Law).ACADEMIC INTEGRITY EXPECTATIONSAcademic integrity is violated by any dishonest act which is committed in an academic context including, but not limited to the following:Use of Sources  Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s language, ideas, information, or original material without acknowledging the source. Examples ofplagiarism:1. Paper is downloaded from an Internet source and/or obtained from a paper mill.2. Paper contains part or all of the writings of another person (including another student), copied without citation.3. Paper contains passages that were cut and pasted from an Internet source, without citation.While students are responsible for knowing how to quote from, paraphrase, and cite sources correctly, the ability to apply that information in all writingsituations is an advanced literacy skill acquired over time through repeated practice. When a student has attempted to acknowledge sources but has not doneso fully or completely, the instructor may determine that the issue is misuse of sources or bad writing, rather than plagiarism. Factors that may be relevantto the determination between misuse of sources and plagiarism include prior academic integrity education at Syracuse University, and the program level ofthe student.   Course Work and Research1. The use or attempted use of unauthorized aids in examinations or other academic exercises submitted for evaluation;2. Fabrication, falsification, or misrepresentation of data, results, sources for papers or reports; in clinical practice, as in reporting experiments,measurements, statistical analyses, tests, or other studies never performed; manipulating or altering data or other manifestations of research toachieve a desired result; selective reporting, including the deliberate suppression of conflicting or unwanted data;3. Copying from another student’s work;4. Actions that destroy or alter the work of another student;5. Unauthorized cooperation in completing assignments or examinations;6. Submission of the same written work in more than one course without prior written approval from both instructors.Communications1. Violating the confidentiality of an academic integrity investigation, resolution, or documentation;2. Making a false report of academic dishonesty;3. Dishonesty in requests for make-up exams, for extensions of deadlines for submitting papers, or in any other matter relating to a course.Representations and Materials Misuse1. Falsification of records, reports, or documents associated with the educational process;2. Misrepresentation of one’s own or another’s identity for academic purposes;3. Misrepresentation of material facts or circumstances in relation to examinations, papers, or other academic activities;4. Sale of papers, essays, or research for fraudulent use;5. Alteration or falsification of University records;216. Unauthorized use of University academic facilities or equipment, including computer accounts and files;7. Unauthorized recording, sale, purchase, or use of academic lectures, academic computer software, or other instructional materials;8. Expropriation or abuse of ideas and preliminary data obtained during the process of editorial or peer review of work submitted to journals, or inproposals for funding by agency panels or by internal University committees;9. Expropriation and/or inappropriate dissemination of personally-identifying human subject data;10. Unauthorized removal, mutilation, or deliberate concealment of materials in University libraries, media, laboratories, or academic resource centers.COURSE-SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONSA. The instructor of record is responsible for determining and communicating course-specific academic integrity expectations. Instructors of recordare responsible for stating, in writing, course-specific expectations, particularly those regarding use of sources and collaboration.B. Students are responsible for consulting their instructors for any clarification needed on academic integrity standards, including those set forth inthis policy and those that are course-specific.C. Collusion is assisting or attempting to assist another in an act of academic dishonesty. Collusion is distinct from collaborative learning, whichmay be a valuable component of scholarly development. Acceptable levels of collaboration vary in different courses, and students are expected toconsult with their instructor if they are uncertain whether their cooperative activities are acceptable.TRANSCRIPT NOTATIONSWhen an “F” grade for course failure is imposed for an academic integrity violation, the grade on the transcript will be marked with the notation “(X).”The failing grade is counted toward the GPA. If the “(X)” notation is applied for a first violation, it will be removed only upon the student’s completion ofan educational program and full compliance with all consequences associated with the violation. After the “(X)” notation is removed, the student maypetition to flag the failing grade. If the “(X)” is applied for a subsequent violation, the notation will be permanently retained on the transcript.Academic integrity violations that do not involve course work may also be noted on a student’s transcript.  Such violations appear on the transcript as“Academic Integrity Sanction” with the date the sanction was imposed.  If the sanction is applied for a first violation, it will be removed only upon thestudent’s completion of an educational program and full compliance with all consequences associated with the violation. If the sanction is a applied for asubsequent violation, it will be permanently retained on the transcript.Academic RenewalUndergraduate StudentsUndergraduates who are readmitted or admitted (for previously non-matriculated students) to SU with a cumulative GPA of less than 2.0 may apply foracademic renewal, if returning after an absence of seven years (14 full fall and spring semesters). Before applying for academic renewal: discuss academic consequences with an advisor in your school/collegeif you are receiving or plan to apply for financial aid, discuss the process of academic renewal with a financial aid counselor  During the first semester of your re-admission or admission, complete a contract with your school/college no later than the midterm date of that semester,as published in the academic calendarSchools/colleges will review main campus students’ academic renewal requests at the end of the first semester. Unless otherwise noted in the tablebelow, a minimum semester GPA of 2.5 is required for a full-time course load with no I, F, NA, P, V, WD, or missing grades.University College students must complete 12 credits within two years (four consecutive fall and spring semesters) and must have attained aminimum cumulative GPA of 2.5, with no I, F, NA, P, V, WD, or missing grades.  There will be no selective review of only certain courses for flagging. If you do not meet your school’s/college’s requirements for academic renewal at thetime of review, you may not petition again. School/College RulesEducationA GPA of 3.0 is required for the first semester (full-time students) or first 12 credits (University Collegestudents).Public Communications Only students who have attempted no more than 30 credits or the equivalent of two full semesters mayapply for academic renewal.Sport and Human DynamicsA GPA of 3.0 is required for the first semester (full-time students) or first 12 credits (University Collegestudents).Visual and Performing Arts  A 2.8 GPA is required for the first semester (full-time students) or first 12 credits (University Collegestudents).ACADEMIC RENEWAL AND THE TRANSCRIPTIf academic renewal is approved, your GPA will be reset to 0.00, and the GPA calculation will resume with the courses you take after readmission oradmission. The courses you took before academic renewal will still appear on your transcript, but will be flagged (see "Flagging") to remove them from allcredit and grade calculations. The notation “(ar)” will reflect that flagging was done under the academic renewal policy.  Your prior coursework will be evaluated in the same manner as transfer credit. Only prior coursework with a grade of C or higher (no C-, D, or F grades)that can be applied toward your degree program will be accepted as a block of credits from your prior record. Grades in these courses will not calculatetoward your GPA. If you subsequently transfer to another SU school/college, prior coursework will be re-evaluated.22If you elect academic renewal, then to be considered for University honors at graduation you must complete 60 credits of SU letter-graded courses that canbe calculated in your GPA.Academic Standing Minimum GPA To Continue Graduate WorkGraduate StudentsGraduate students must earn at least a 2.8 cumulative GPA in the first 30 credits of graduate study at Syracuse University.  The academic unit may cancelmatriculation if this requirement is not met.Class StandingUndergraduate StudentsClass standing is determined by the number of SU-earned credits, plus credits accepted for transfer credit and other types of external credit, e.g., APexamination. Class standing is calculated as follows:ClassTotal Cumulative CreditsFreshman0-23Sophomore24-53Junior54-83Senior84 and aboveAcademic ProbationAny student who has a cumulative GPA of less than 2.0 and for whom a more serious action is not appropriate may be placed on probation. You may alsobe placed on probation if your semester GPA falls below 2.0, or if you fail to meet other criteria for good academic standing as established by yourschool/college. Each school/college reviews its students’ records and determines the appropriate probation actions to be applied from the categories listedbelow. School/college offices can provide more detailed information about academic policies. If you are under any academic probation your financial aidmay be impacted.Schools/colleges send probation letters that explain the reason for the action, such as low cumulative GPA or number of Incompletes, and specify theconditions under which good academic standing can be regained.The probation categories are described below and include College Probation; Probation, One-Semester Trial; and Academic Suspension. Schools/collegesmay:apply any one of the categories at any time, depending on school/college policy and individual student records; categories are not necessarilyapplied sequentiallyapply an action more than once to the same studentCollege ProbationThis action applies to a student who has a cumulative average above 2.0, but who fails to meet other school/college criteria for good standing. These criteriainclude the following:School/College RulesArchitectureTerm GPA less than 2.0, a term of architecture courses below 2.0, more than 12 credit hours of Incomplete or NAgrades, fewer than 24 credit hours completed in a 12-month period, or insufficient progress toward degree.Arts and SciencesStudents earning less than a 2.0 semester GPA will be placed on Academic Warning for the following semester. Students who earn less than a 2.0 semester GPA a second time will be placed on Academic Probation.  And if theyearn less than a 2.0 semester GPA for a third time, they will be placed on Final Probation and they may possibly besuspended from college.EducationExcessive number of Incompletes, missing grades, and/or limited progress toward degree, and/or students at or below a2.0 cumulative GPA may be placed on a one-term trial (OTT) at any point in time. Inclusive early childhood specialeducation and inclusive elementary special education: cumulative, content, or education course GPA of less than 2.8;content or education less than 3.0 for music education. Physical education and health and physical education:cumulative GPA below 2.8 or below 3.0 in required professional education courses. Health and exercise science:cumulative or major course GPA below 2.8. Selected studies:  cumulative GPA below 2.8. Guidelines are published inthe School of Education Undergraduate Handbook.Engineering and Computer ScienceTerm GPA less than 2.0. Less than 2.0 in all mathematics, science, and ECS courses taken at SU. Completion of fewerthan 12 credit hours in one semester or 24 credit hours within any 12-month period. Failure to maintain satisfactoryprogress toward degree.  In addition to the above conditions, computer science students only: GPA of less than 2.66723in core courses.Information StudiesExcessive missing grades, Incompletes, failure to make normal progress, or failure to complete prerequisites for thefollowing semester’s registration.Management Semester GPA less than 2.0, earning fewer than 12 credit hours in two consecutive semesters, or failure to meetadequate progress standards.Public CommunicationsGPA of less than 2.0 in Public Communications courses, or excessive missing grades or Incompletes, or semester GPAbelow 2.0 for two consecutive semesters, or failure to make normal progress toward a degree.Sport and Human DynamicsStudents with one or more of the following conditions will be placed on academic probation: semester and/orcumulative GPA below 2.0; excessive number of Incomplete, NA, or missing grades; lack of progress toward degree.University CollegeLegal Studies and B.P.S students: Semester or cumulative GPA less than 2.0; less than 2.0 in legal studies courses;excessive number of Incompletes, NA, or missing grades.Visual and Performing ArtsSemester GPA below 2.0 with cumulative GPA above 2.0; or excessive NAs, Incompletes, or other failure to makenormal progress toward a degree.Probation, One-Semester TrialIf your school/college determines that you have serious deficiencies in progress toward your degree requirements, usually including a cumulative GPA below2.0, the school/college may impose a one-semester trial specifying that certain requirements be met by the end of the term. Failing to meet theserequirements may result in suspension. Each school/college’s standards are available at the school/college undergraduate office.Ineligible To ContinueIf your school/college sets specific conditions for continuing registration, this action may be applied to cancel early registration and/or preventparticipation in registration for new coursework until the requirements are met. It may also apply in situations where full-time status is no longer allowed,but part-time status is permitted. A student who is ineligible to continue may have a GPA either above or below 2.0.Academic SuspensionAcademically suspended students are officially withdrawn from the University. Students face academic suspension for failing to meet the conditionsestablished by any previous probation action or for seriously departing from standards required for good standing. GPA may be either above or below 2.0 atthe time of suspension. If a suspension action is taken, the school/college will send a letter:specifying the reason for the actionexplaining appeal proceduresThe next semester’s registration will be cancelled or prevented, and future semester registrations won’t be allowed unless:you have successfully appealed your suspension; oryou have been accepted to a new school/college as an internal transfer; oryou have been readmitted to the school/college that suspended you (See “Leave of Absence, Withdrawal, and Readmission”).Advanced Credit ExaminationsAdvanced Credit (AC) examinations provide matriculated students the opportunity to be tested on, and to receive credit for, knowledge and skills alreadyachieved that would be covered by regular SU courses. You must petition the appropriate academic department for approval to take an AC exam; thedepartment is under no obligation to approve the request. The exams are administered and graded by faculty. Each Advanced Credit exam carries a fee, at anamount published each year in “Tuition, Fees, and Related Policies." For undergraduates, your school/college may accept a maximum of 30 semester hoursfrom a combination of SU Advanced Credit exams and any other credit (e.g., AP exams, experiential learning). Advanced Credit examsmust be associated with SU course subjects and numbersare not appropriate for all courses, such as Selected Topics and those that require a Proposal for Independent Studymay not be applied to the residency requirement (see “Residency Requirement”)may not be taken in a course for which credit was already earnedare not considered as retaken courses for flagging purposes [see “Flagging (Removing courses from calculation toward the degree and GPA)”]will be removed from the official transcript if an equivalent course is subsequently taken at SU and passedare recorded on the transcript by credit hours and grade, and contribute to total credit hours earned and cumulative degree GPAGraduate StudentsGraduate students who wish to obtain credit toward advanced degrees for knowledge in a field essential to their programs of study but acquired by means thatpreclude formal transfer to SU may petition for an Advanced Credit examination in a course or courses covering the relevant area of study. The petitionrequesting an Advanced Credit examination must state the basis for the belief that the student has attained competence at the graduate level in the specifiedacademic area and be accompanied by a statement from the student’s department supporting the petition and accepting responsibility for preparing andadministering the examination. The minimum passing grade for a graduate AC Exam is B.Undergraduate StudentsApproval of your academic advisor, the appropriate department chair, and your home school/college is required in order to take an Advanced Credit24examination. You must earn a grade of C or higher to pass the exam. AC exams count toward the 30 semester hours maximum credits that will be acceptedfrom a combination of AC exams, experiential learning, extra-institutional credit, and external examination programs toward your total number of creditsrequired for graduation.Attendance In ClassesAttendance in classes is expected in all courses at SU. Class attendance requirements and policies concerning nonattendance are established by theinstructor(s) of each class.Competency And Proficiency ExaminationsAdvanced standing, exemption, or placement examinations may be given by certain departments, e.g., mathematics; English; and languages, literatures, andlinguistics, to determine where students should be placed in a certain sequence of courses. No credit is given for these examinations, and no requirements are waived by successfully completing placement or advanced standing examinations. Youmay, however, be excused from prerequisite courses on the basis of these examinations.Consortium AgreementsSU has formal consortia arrangements through SU Abroad, the Consortium for Culture and Medicine, and the Graduate Scholar Exchange Program. Exceptfor these, SU does not allow students to enroll at other institutions under an individual consortium arrangement, nor does it award financial aid to studentswho choose to enroll at other institutions, e.g., while on a leave of absence.If you are a matriculated SU student who wants to study abroad through a program not directly administered or sponsored by SU Abroad, contact the SUAbroad office at least three months before the start of the program to request consideration for a consortium agreement, which is required if you want tohave the classes you take abroad count toward your degree program and continue to receive financial aid during your overseas program.If approved for a consortium agreement, credit earned through such programs is generally treated as SU credit. Your school/college and/or department willdetermine acceptable courses and how they will be applied.Courses Course Numbering SystemRemedial, developmental, and noncredit courses000-099Freshman-level courses100-199Sophomore-level courses200-299Junior- and senior-level courses300-499Joint undergraduate-and graduate-level courses500-599First-year graduate-level courses600-699Second- and third-year graduate-level courses700-899Readings, research, and individual study courses at the doctoral level only900-996Master’s thesis997Individualized study at the graduate level998Doctoral dissertation999Refer to the “Guide to Reading Course Descriptions” section of the course catalog for further explanation. CreditThe unit of credit at SU is the semester hour. Each semester hour represents one class period of 50 minutes per week for 15 weeks, or the equivalent.Laboratory or field courses require a minimum of two or three class periods a week for each credit hour.This section of the Academic Rules describes certain options for credit that may apply toward some students’ degree and certificate programs. Transfercredit, experiential learning, external exams, and restricted graduate credit are among the examples described below. See the Course Catalog and confer withyour academic advisor for a complete overview of credit requirements needed to fulfill your degree or certificate requirements.Restricted Graduate CreditRestricted graduate credit is credit earned at the graduate level by students who aren’t matriculated in a graduate program. Restricted credit must beconverted to graduate credit in order to be included in a graduate degree or certificate program. All coursework taken as a non-matriculated studentautomatically calculates toward the graduate GPA unless a petition to flag the courses is submitted to and approved by the Graduate School, aftermatriculation in a degree or certificate program.Conversion To Graduate Credit25You may apply to have up to 12 credits of restricted graduate credit converted to graduate credit if you meet all of the following conditions:you become matriculated in a graduate degree or certificate programyour overall average in all SU graduate work is at least 2.8you earned a B or better in each courseyour courses are part of a degree or certificate program approved by your departmentyou have completed your coursework within the time limit allowed for the degreeRestricted graduate credit earned during the term in which you become matriculated in the Graduate School is converted automatically to graduate credit. School/College RulesEducationIn the higher education degree program, no more than six hours of restricted graduate credit may be converted tograduate credit. In all other graduate degree programs, no more than nine hours of restricted graduate credit may beconverted to graduate credit.ManagementNo more than six credits of restricted credit may be converted to graduate credit.Counting Credits Towards Multiple Degrees And/Or ProgramsNYSED limits the counting of credits toward multiple degrees and/or programs to protect the academic integrity of each degree and/or program. When astudent is counting credits towards multiple degrees and/or programs, in the same or closely related field(s) and the coursework makes up an integral part ofthe degrees and/or programs, the following restrictions apply: 1. In no instance shall course credit be counted more than twice in satisfaction of the requirements for multiple degrees and/or programs.2. In order to earn two or more distinct degrees and/or programs (including Certificates of Advanced Study (C.A.S), you must earn a minimum of 80percent of the combined total of SU credits normally required for each of the degrees.  However, in cases where the C.A.S. curriculum is embeddedwithin another degree program, credit from the C.A.S. may be counted in its entirety for the C.A.S. and other degree.3. Two 12-credit C.A.S.s may not be awarded for less than 21 credits.4. Two 30-credit Master's degrees will not be awarded for fewer than 51 credits, nor will three 30-credit Master's degrees be awarded for fewer than 75credits. 5. You must be admitted to the degree program in each of the awarding academic units.Note:  These restrictions do not apply to joint/dual programs with the College of Law or the Master of Philosophy degrees.SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and SU concurrent study:  SU and SUNY ESF have agreements that encourage concurrent master'sstudy in environmental science and forestry with SU degree work in public communications, law, management, public administration, and certain educationprograms.  Other SU fields may also qualify.  Contact your school/college, the Graduate School and SUNY ESF for specific requirements and proceduresregarding concurrent degree work and counting of credits.Undergraduate And Graduate CourseworkUndergraduate StudentsIf you are an undergraduate (matriculated or non-matriculated) who would like to take graduate-level courses at SU that would apply toward a future SUgraduate degree or certificate program, you must petition to register for these courses. Such courses will earn “restricted graduate credit” until you register asa matriculated SU graduate student.After you matriculate, and with approval of a petition, the graduate credits earned while an undergraduate will be transferred into your graduate record,subject to the conversion to graduate credit rules, as a block of credit hours. These credits will not be applied toward the SU undergraduate degree. They willbe flagged on the undergraduate section of the transcript and removed from calculations there. Under no circumstances will grades earned in these flaggedcourses calculate in either the undergraduate or graduate GPA.No credit that is applied to the undergraduate degree may be applied also to the graduate degree, unless such double-counting falls under the explicitarticulation of a combined bachelor’s and master’s degree program that has been approved by and registered with NYSED.Calculation Of Credit HoursThe following calculate toward cumulative credit and grade totals on your academic transcript:letter grades and Incompletesa course in which a "Pass (P)" was earned is included in total earned credits but not grade point calculationsCalculations made by schools/colleges to determine progress toward degree requirements may exclude courses appearing on your transcript that are notapplicable to the specific degree program. As noted under the flagging rules, courses may be removed from calculation under certain circumstances.Undergraduate StudentsWith the approval of your home school/college, you may apply as free elective credit up to six credit hours of college-level remedial and developmentalcourses (numbered 000-099) in which a passing grade was earned toward your degree requirements.26Flagging (Removing Courses From GPA, Credit And Degree Calculation)When certain requirements are met, courses may be “flagged,” which excludes them from GPA and semester and cumulative credit hour totals. The flagsymbol is noted on the official transcript. Flagging a course may affect financial aid eligibility e.g., flagging a course in which a passing grade was earned mayalter the calculation of satisfactory progress. For additional information, see your financial aid counselor. Once your degree has been awarded, you may not request to flag courses taken before the degree date.Flagging Courses That Have Been RetakenTo qualify for flagging, both the original and subsequent course must be taken at SU and have the same course subject and number.  A school/college mayprohibit you from flagging a lower level course after you have completed with a passing grade a higher level course in the same subject.If a course is no longer offered under the same subject and/or number, you may petition the school/college in advance to retake the course most nearlyequivalent in content and level.  Certification by the academic department that the course is a close equivalent--not just a substitution for the degreerequirement--is required.Except as noted in TABLE A, only the credits and grade received in the second course will count.Both the original course and the retaken course remain on your transcript.A course is repeatable if it may be retaken and counted more than once toward fulfillment of degree requirements.  You may not flag coursesdesignated as repeatable, since course content is different each time the course is offered. Exceptions:Selected Topics courses (with numbers ending in “00”) may be flagged if they have exactly the same titleProposal for Independent Study courses may be flagged when the course subject, number, description, and requirements are the sameAdvanced Credit exams or courses that merely substitute for a degree requirement are not considered to be retaken courses for flagging purposes.Graduate StudentsYou may petition your academic unit and the Graduate School to flag the following:undergraduate or remedial courses that are not part of your graduate program, such as English as a Second Languagecourses taken while non-matriculatedwhen officially changing degree programs, courses that don’t apply to your new degree program under certain conditions. Contact your departmentfor further information.when retaking a course in which you earned a grade of C+, C, C- or F, with the approval of your academic unit and the Graduate School. Graduatecourses may retaken only once. (Note that unless flagging is requested, both the original course and the retaken course will be included incalculations.)Undergraduate StudentsCourses that have been retaken will be flagged according to the following rules.TABLE A Retaken Courses And Flagging Rules School/CollegeRetaken Course RuleFlagging RuleArchitectureStudents may take a course for gradeimprovement.

A studio course may be retaken onlywhen a grade of F has been received.The higher of two grades is computed in the GPA.Flagging Courses When Changing School/College Or ProgramUndergraduate StudentsIf you are admitted through intra-university transfer into a different SU school/college, you may petition to flag courses you already completed that can’tbe included in your new program. You must first meet minimum criteria for admission to the new school/college or program, and can only petition your newschool/college to flag courses after admission. If you change programs within your school/college, in rare instances when the new program requirespreparation distinctly different from that of the former program, you may petition to have courses flagged that can’t be applied toward your new program.Simply changing majors does not qualify for flagging.Arts and Sciences:  Only D and F grades in non-Arts and Sciences courses that were required for the previous program may be flagged at the student’srequest. A, B, C, and I grades in such courses cannot be flagged.Education and Management:  If you transfer into either of these schools and elect to flag courses that do not apply toward your new program, then youmust flag all courses that don’t apply.Flagging Graduate-Level Courses Taken As An UndergraduateIf you petition to take graduate-level courses that will not apply to your undergraduate degree, you may also petition to flag those courses so that theydon’t count toward your undergraduate record. If the courses are subsequently accepted as restricted graduate credit toward a graduate program at SU, thenthey will automatically be flagged on the undergraduate transcript. In that case, credits earned in the courses will count toward the graduate degreerequirements, but the grades will calculate in neither the undergraduate nor the graduate GPA.Flagging Courses Under Academic Renewal PolicySee "Academic Renewal"Transfer CreditIn compliance with NYSED regulations, SU only awards transfer credit for courses that are an integral part of an SU degree program, as determined by theappropriate SU academic unit. Graduate StudentsAt the graduate level, schools/colleges and departments may assess and accept creditearned at another regionally accredited graduate school in the United States or at an institution equivalently recognized in another country;earned in a course in which the grade earned was at least a B. Coursework completed on a pass/fail basis is not eligible for transfer, unless approvedby both the academic unit chair and the dean of the Graduate School; andthat is an integral part of the degree program.   28Transfer credit should be evaluated and posted no later than the end of the semester preceding the semester in which coursework for the degree will becompleted. All coursework applied toward a degree must comply with all time limitations. A maximum of 30 percent of credits counted toward a master’s degree at SU may be transferred from another institution provided that the credits are anintegral part of the degree program. Transfer credit can comprise no more than 50 percent of the doctoral coursework. This rule does not apply todual degree programs and to degree programs that are offered jointly with another university. Certificate ProgramsA maximum of three credits from a combination of transfer and/or external examinations/extra-institutional and experiential learning will be acceptedtoward a C.A.S.  Exceptions may be granted by petition to the dean of the Graduate School.School/College RulesInformation StudiesUp to 15 credits from National Defense University may be applied to the M.S. program in informationmanagement.Up to 15 credits received from the University of Virginia School of Continuing and Professional StudiesCertificate in Cybersecurity Management may be applied to the M.S. in Information Management.Credits completed in approved programs at the Army Signal Center School may be applied to the M.S. ininformation management, and the M.S. in telecommunications and network management.ManagementStudents may transfer a maximum of six credits of elective courses into their M.B.A. or M.S. program fromanother AACSB-accredited business school. Students must file a petition and receive approval prior totaking the course. Grades from these courses will not be transferred, nor will they count toward the GPA. Agrade of B or better is required in the transfer course.MaxwellUp to 12 credits from Tsinghua University may be applied to the executive master of public administration.Public CommunicationsA maximum of 20 percent of credits counted toward the following master’s degrees in the S.I. NewhouseSchool of Public Communications may be transferred: advertising; arts journalism; broadcast and digitaljournalism; communications management; documentary film and history; magazine, newspaper & onlinejournalism; media management; photography; public relations; and television, radio & film.Undergraduate StudentsGenerally, schools/colleges may consider accepting transfer credit from:institutions recognized byregional accrediting commissionsnational accrediting bodiesprofessional organizations that accredit free-standing professional schools and programs within multipurpose institutions*institutions that are recognized candidates for accreditationrecognized foreign tertiary-level institutions, chartered and authorized by their national governments, generally through the Ministry of Educationa formal transfer articulation agreement *  For students enrolled in an accredited program at a non-accredited institution, only courses within the discipline that is accredited will be considered fortransfer credit. General education and other courses from the institution will not be considered. However, not all schools/colleges accept credit from all of these sources. SU grants transfer credit based on course content, the quality of your performance, and applicability to your program. Transfer credit is evaluated only forthe degree or certificate program to which you’re admitted, and may change if you move into a different SU program. A re-evaluation of transfer creditmay also affect your financial aid, especially if your class standing alters. If all of your previous work isn’t accepted for transfer, you may enter SU at adifferent class level than you had attained at your prior institution. A maximum of 90 credits of transfer credit or a combination of transfer credit and anyother credit (e.g., AP exams, experiential learning) will be accepted. If you plan to take courses at another institution that will transfer back into your SU degree, obtain your home school/college’s approval before enrolling.If you take courses at a two-year collegebefore junior standing (54 credits), you may take approved coursework during a summer session or while on leave of absence.after attaining junior standing, the only courses that will be approved will be those that fulfill lower-division requirements or free electives.a maximum of 66 credits from a combination of credit from a two-year college and any other credit (e.g., AP exams, experiential learning) will beaccepted. School/College RulesAny transfer credit to be applied to a Syracuse University major or minor must be formally accepted via writtenpetition by the major or minor department. Students are not given transfer credit until their cumulative average is 2.0or higher. In addition, the following restrictions apply:29Arts and Sciences--  Basic or college algebra is not accepted.--  Remedial or developmental coursework is not accepted.--  Transfer credit for foreign language courses must be evaluated by the Department of Languages, Literatures, andLinguistics at Syracuse University to determine the appropriate course equivalent.  [Note:  Foreign language coursestaken at schools or programs that are not accredited will not be reviewed or approved.]--  Pass (P) or Satisfactory (S) grades are never accepted toward the fulfillment of requirements for your major/minoror the A&S Liberal Arts Core.  If courses in which you earned a P or S are accepted as transfer credit, they will beawarded as elective credit onlyManagementA minimum of 27 credit hours of required Management courses must be taken at SU.Public Communications No more than 12 hours of communications course credits earned in another college or university may be acceptedtoward meeting the requirements of a major program of study in the School of Public Communications.University College No more than 12 credit hours earned in another college or university may be accepted toward meeting the program ofstudy requirements in the bachelor of professional studies degree. No more than nine credit hours earned in anothercollege or university may be accepted to the LGL credit certificate program requirements. No more than three credithours earned in another college or university may be accepted to the organizational leadership credit certificateprogram requirements.How Transfer Credit Applies Toward Your DegreeAll SU transfer credit is measured in semester hours. If your prior institution used a different credit hour system, credits accepted for transfer are convertedto semester hours, e.g., credit from institutions on the quarter-hour system is converted to semester hours using the formula of one quarter-hour equals 2/3semester hour. Grades don’t transfer and do not affect your SU cumulative GPA. If you subsequently take a course at SU for which you had previouslyreceived transfer credit, the transfer credit will be removed. Additional transfer credit rulesGrades of C- or below will not be accepted.“Pass” grades must be certified to be at a C level or higher. Pass grades will normally be accepted only as elective credit.Second undergraduate degrees carry additional restrictions; contact your school/college for details.Arts and Sciences students are not given transfer credit until their cumulative average is 2.0 or higher.For students on academic probation in Public Communications and Visual and Performing Arts, transfer credit will not be given until the cumulativeGPA is 2.0 or higher.If you were previously matriculated at SUNY ESF, then subsequently matriculated at SU, coursework taken while an ESF student, including SUcourses, is treated and evaluated as transfer credit from ESF. Such SU courses do not appear or calculate on the Syracuse University transcript,except as they are included in a block of transfer credits, i.e., total credit hours accepted from SUNY ESF.Credit For Extra-Institutional And Experiential Learning, And External Examination ProgramsFollowing University rules and program requirements, SU schools/colleges and graduate departments may award credit for various external examinations andother types of extra-institutional and experiential learning. Such credit is evaluated only for the degree or certificate program to which you are admitted,and may change if you move into a different SU program. Credit is evaluated using the guidelines of the American Council on Education and the Council forAdvancement of Experiential Learning, as well as our own institutional assessment. See TABLES B, C, and D below for a listing of undergraduate-levelexams that may qualify. For examinations or subject areas not covered in the listing below, contact your school/college or appropriate department todetermine whether credit may be considered or if you are a candidate for an Advanced Credit Examination. Also contact your school/college to discuss othertypes of non-institutional experience, such as the military, business, or government, which may qualify for credit.Undergraduate credit may also be awarded for some matriculation examinations and post-secondary educational experiences offered in other countries.Decisions about awarding such credit are made by the student’s school/college during the admissions process.Portfolio ReviewCredit may be granted for studio work applicable toward professional degrees in the College of Visual and Performing Arts and the School of Architectureupon departmental evaluation of the portfolio.Undergraduate StudentsA maximum of 30 credits from any combination of extra-institutional and experiential learning, external examinations, and SU Advanced Creditexams may be accepted.A maximum of 66 credits from a combination of credit from a two-year college and any other credit (e.g., AP exams, experiential learning) will beaccepted.If you subsequently take a course at SU for which credit was awarded for extra-institutional, experiential learning, or external examinationprograms, that credit will be removed. External Examinations30Undergraduate StudentsCollege Board Advanced Placement (AP) and College Level Examination Program (CLEP)Your home school/college uses the rules in effect at the time you matriculate at SU in order to evaluate and accept degree-program credit for AP and CLEPexams. The academic unit with principal responsibility for the examination subject recommends the minimum score for credit and SU course equivalency;however, your home school/college may have higher score requirements and/or different qualifications, both for awarding credit and meeting degreerequirements.

Mary Ann Shaw Center For Public & Community ServicePamela Kirwin Heintz, Director237 Schine Student Center, 315-443-3051http://shawcenter.syr.eduThe Mary Ann Shaw Center for Public and Community Service (SHAW CENTER) provides support for faculty to integrate community based servicelearning/research into academic coursework for undergraduate and graduate students. It does this by: furnishing organizational information about placementsin nonprofit and/or public organizations  for those seeking community based service learning/research opportunities; helping create newpartnerships/collaborations and learning/research opportunities; and supporting ongoing academic programs/projects/courses that foster community basedservice learning/research on the local, national, and global levels. Since opening in 1994, the SHAW CENTER has provided assistance to faculty in theform of consultation and orientation; identification and mitigation of risk/liability issues; and ongoing support, monitoring, and evaluation. Additionally,the SHAW CENTER offers a variety of curricular and co-curricular service opportunities at nonprofit and/or public organizations.  Every college within theUniversity offers community based service learning/research opportunities for students.The ProgramCommunity based service learning components of courses provide opportunities for students to put the value of learning into action through communityservice placements. The students can connect theory and practice as they train for life, enrich their moral character, and develop their sense of civicresponsibility. This educational opportunity deepens the students’ sense of connectedness and responsibility to others and includes elements of vocation andavocation.Students participate in the community based service components of their courses by completing a predetermined number of service hours at a communitysite. Under the direction of the course professor, teaching assistants, academic managers, and SHAW CENTER professional staff, students keep journals,write papers, do action based research, and present projects and reports to reflect on and process their community service experiences. The course professorassumes grading responsibility. Academic credit for the service learning experience is awarded by the professor through credit for the course.The SHAW CENTER works with students, faculty, teaching assistants, academic administrators, and community site partners and supervisors to assist insuccessfully implementing community based learning opportunities. The SHAW CENTER provides information about placement options; orientation tothe community; assistance when there are questions; transportation (on a first-come, first-served basis to the extent resources allow); and evaluation of thecommunity service component of the course for future improvement.CoursesStudents are invited to visit the SHAW CENTER office or web site at http://shawcenter.syr.edu/ to learn more about course options.  Students areencouraged to discuss course options that interest them with the appropriate faculty advisor before registering. Students can, with the approval of theprofessor, request individual placements within courses to enhance assignments or course goals. The SHAW CENTER will work to help the student develop68and implement an appropriate placement, as well as assist with the reflection and processing of the experience, if appropriate.Renee Crown University Honors ProgramProfessor Stephen Kuusisto, Director306 Bowne Hall, 315-443-2759The Renée Crown University Honors Program is a selective, demanding, and rewarding program for outstanding students who seek intense intellectualchallenge and are prepared to invest the extra effort it takes to meet that challenge. It is marked by four distinguishing characteristics:• heightened expectations;• participation in a vibrant and active community of learners;• intensity of intellectual experience; and• special intellectual opportunities and responsibilities.The program is open to qualified students from all undergraduate majors at Syracuse University. Its requirements, supplemental to those of their majors,stipulate that they demonstrate the attributes of depth, breadth, command of language, global awareness, civic engagement, and collaborative capacity bysuccessfully completing the following program requirements:DEPTH1. An Honors Capstone Project, with written summary for a non-expert audience; and2. XXX  499, Capstone Project preparation, in the major (e.g., 4Tel: 315-443-5490Fax: 315-443-5376Description:Arabic is spoken by over 300 million speakers in 22 countries in the Middle East and North Africa. It is also an official language in 26 countries, theAfrican Union, the Arab League, and the United Nations. It is the main medium of communication in business, government, and the media throughout theArabic-speaking world. Currently, Arabic is designated as one of the critical languages by the federal government, which has been investing substantially inincreasing the number of Americans with high proficiency in Arabic.The increasing number of students enrolling in Arabic language, linguistics, and culture courses in Syracuse University in recent years and the high level ofretention of those students in consecutive years demonstrate the great demand for the study of Arabic.A minor in Arabic will prepare students to read, write, and communicate orally in Arabic at a functional level in an international setting, and to recognizeand respond to cultural patterns of Arabic-speaking peoples. It will allow students majoring in other disciplines, e.g. Middle Eastern Studies, PoliticalScience, Business, Journalism, International Relations, Public Relations, Translation, etc. to employ their knowledge of Arabic language and culture in theirfuture careers. A minor in Arabic will increase students’ attractiveness in the job market, especially with the present significant demand for Americans whocan demonstrate high proficiency in Arabic.Admission:Students should have completed the prerequisite 4-1070315-443-2586noyce@syr.eduAccreditationThe School of Education is accredited by  the National Council fo Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).On July 1, 2013, NCATE consolidated with the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) to form the Council for the Accreditation of EducatorPreparation (CAEP).   CAEP is the new accrediting body for educator preparation.  CAEP continues to require institutions of higher education who prepareschool professionals (Education Preparation Providers (EPPs)) to use performance based assessments to measure a candidate’s proficiencies, a programs’success in achieving its goals, and the EPPs’ operations in support of candidates and programs.Professional accreditation of preparatory education programs is the bedrock upon which all professions (e.g., architecture, engineering, medicine, and law)have built their reputations. It assures that those entering the respective field have been suitably prepared to practice through assimilation of a body ofknowledge and pre-service practice in the profession. Accreditation of schools of education indicates that the school underwent rigorous external review byprofessionals, that performance of a teacher candidate in the program has been thoroughly assessed before he or she is recommended for licensure, and thatprograms meet standards set by the teaching profession at large.Regional accreditation organizations are now following this same rigorous approach to assessments and are asking faculty from education to be leaders attheir institutions. This paradigm shift is creating a culture on college campuses towards innovation and quality improvements.Please refer to the CAEP website for additional information on accreditation:   http://caepnet.org/Student ServicesTHE OFFICE OF ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SERVICESThe Office of Academic and Student Services was created to ensure that students get the most out of their college experience.

Biology Secondary Teacher Preparation ProgramCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in Biology and Secondary Science Education (Biology) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for Biology (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in these areas,and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan. ,123 General Biology (Students with AP credits of Biology with laboratory may omit introductory courses)CORE COURSES (9 credits)• : General Biology•           , 123 and at least one upper-division BIO course from the list below) A course in social science.

Acomplete list of available majors, minors and concentrations can be found in the Undergraduate Course Catalog; students may develop their ownindividualized multidisciplinary majors with the assistance of their advisor and permission of liberal arts departments in the College of Arts and Sciences.427INDIVIDUAL FOCUS AREAS IN EDUCATIONStudents must choose at least 18 credits of coursework from approved courses in education based on their thematic or career focus. Students satisfy thisrequirement by taking courses listed in any of the focus areas below. Students may make substitutions with the approval of their advisors. The four focusareas to choose from are:Cultural Foundations Of American Schooling: Schooling And DiversityThis focus is suitable for students who may want to pursue any of the following career interests: seek a teaching career at a future point; work with youth innon-school settings; enter the educational media field; or work in public policy settings that focus on public schooling. Students interested in this focus areamight also want to choose courses from the pre-teaching focus or the education, technology, and media focus.Pre-Teaching: Study Of Teaching, Learning, And InclusionThis focus is suitable for students who may wish to pursue a career in teaching after completing their undergraduate program. Courses in this focus area mayinclude the study of early childhood, elementary, or secondary education, as well as issues of diversity, disability, regular education, special education, andinclusion within schools. Students in this focus area will have significant experiences in public schools during the course of study. Students interested in pre-teaching may want to consider taking relevant courses from other focus areas.Education, Technology, And MediaThis focus is ideal for students who have an interest in the integration of media and technology in various learning contexts. Students learn media literacyskills and gain an understanding of how popular culture influences the promotion and transmission of cultural values within our society. Students interestedin this focus may want to consider taking relevant courses in the cultural foundations of American schooling focus.Post-Secondary And Human Services FieldsThis focus is suitable for students wishing to work in a variety of educational settings, including higher education, international education, and as non-teaching personnel in primary and secondary schools. Whether students are interested in pursuing a graduate degree in a human services field or in seekingemployment immediately after undergraduate studies, this focus area will provide an introduction to the general study and provision of human and socialservices to individuals, families, and communities in public and private human service agencies and organizations. The focus provides a strong foundationfor graduate work in such fields as clinical mental health, school, and student affairs counseling, social work, marriage and family therapy, psychology, andhigher education. ***This focus also has the "fast-track" option for students to begin graduate study toward an Master of Science degree incounseling during their senior year at SU.  See description below.Fast Track To Professional CounselingThis track is designed for highly motivated and focused students interested in pursuing a master’s degree in clinical mental health, school, or student affairscounseling upon completion of their undergraduate degree in Selected Studies in Education, following the ‘post-secondary and human services fields’ track.Students work closely with their advisor to develop a plan of study that will allow them to complete the majority of their undergraduate degree requirementsfor the Selected Studies in Education program prior to their senior year.Students in this track who maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, and take the GRE, are eligible to apply for one of the following master’s degree programs duringtheir junior year:Clinical Mental Health CounselingSchool CounselingStudent Affairs CounselingAdmitted students, with advisor approval, will be able to take up to 18 graduate credits toward their master’s degree during their senior year. Admittedstudents will matriculate into the master’s degree program the semester following completion of their undergraduate degree.One of the primary benefits of this track is that students save time and tuition costs in two ways:1) The ability to apply their undergraduate financial aid package toward graduate credits during their senior year. 2) Eligible to receive the 33% Graduate Student Tuition Scholarship for the remainder of their full-time master’s program. Benefits include saving time and the cost of graduate tuition. Students save time by accruing graduate credits during their senior year; they save additionalmoney because they are also eligible to receive the 33% Graduate Student Tuition Scholarship for the remainder of their full-time master’s program.Social Studies EducationArts And Sciences/Education (Dual) Arts and Sciences contact : Shruti Viswanathan,  Director of Academic Advising and Counseling, 329 Hall of Languages, 315-443-3150.428Education contacts: Pam Hachey (pkhachey@syr.edu) or Carol Radin (cvradin@syr.edu), Assistant Directors of Academic Advising, Office of Academicand Student Services,111 Waverly Avenue, Suite 230; 315-443-9319.In order to graduate with eligibility to apply for New York State teacher certification in the secondary (7-12) academic areas of English, mathematics,science, social studies, or Spanish dual enrollment with the School of Education is required.

Each school/college is free to conduct oral exams in the manner considered to be most effective.The chair of the oral examination committee has several responsibilities:Represent the Dean of the Graduate School.Preside over the exam and ensure that academic unit and Graduate School policies and regulations are followed.Advise the committee as to general exam and questioning procedures.Participate in the questioning of the candidate.Vote on the outcome, and secure the committee’s vote.Submit a written report to the Dean of the Graduate School that includes:the result of the vote, with signatures of approval and appropriate comments;comments on the quality of the examination; andrecommendations for any procedural improvements.Further oral exam considerations:Exam time and place are publicly announced; graduate students and faculty are encouraged to attend and participate, but will not be allowed to vote.If a committee member must be absent from the oral defense:that committee member must submit questions and/or comments in writing to the chair in advance; andthe Graduate School must approve any committee substitutions after the exam has been scheduled, or if more than one committee memberwill be absent.Voting and results:36Voting will be held in executive session of the committee.All committee members, including the chair, vote equally.In order to pass the exam, a majority of the committee must vote favorably; members may make their approval conditional on changes to thedissertation.The committee’s report will recommend one of the following outcomes:passpass with minor revisions (generally editorial)pass with major revisions (substantive)not passYou are entitled to an explanation from the committee concerning the outcome of the defense.Graduate Certificate ProgramsCertificates of Advanced Study (C.A.S.)  (excluding programs registered as preparing individuals for a teaching certificate, educational leadershipcertificate, or a professional license issue by the State Education Department):  A matriculated student who is studying for a C.A.S.  must satisfactorilycomplete a program of study of not less than 12 credits that is approved by the academic unit and filed with the Graduate Degree Certification Office.C.A.S. programs may be part of an existing degree program or a stand-alone program of study.Eligibility requirement  To be awarded a C.A.S., a student must be matriculated in the certificate program for at least one semester.  Matriculation may notbe backdated.Undergraduate Degree And Certificate Programs         Undergraduate Degree ProgramsWithin the bachelor's degree there are four types of degree programs available to undergraduate students at SU: single degree programs, single degreeprograms with double majors, single degree programs with dual majors, and combined degree programs. Generally, students must complete a prescribed courseof study and minimum number of credit hours to complete a degree program.TABLE F Undergraduate Degree Programs  TypeRequirementsNotesSchool/College InformationSingle Degree Program A single degree programconsists of one major in oneschool/college. A single degree program requiresthe completion of all degreerequirements within oneschool/college, including therequirements of one major programof study in that school/college.One degree is conferred and one diplomaawarded.Students are enrolled in one school/college.Single Degree Program with Double Major  A single degree program withdouble major consists of twomajor programs of studysimultaneously pursued (a) inthe same school/college or (b)in two separateschools/colleges of theUniversity.A single degree program withdouble major requires completionof all degree requirements withinone school/college and therequirements for each major.One degree, certified by the homeschool/college, is conferred. One diploma,signed by the dean of the homeschool/college, is awarded.Students are enrolled in one school/college.In some schools/colleges, completion ofdouble majors, especially when the secondmajor is outside the school/college, mayrequire more than the minimum creditsrequired for graduation. Double majors areavailable only in some schools/colleges.Single Degree Program with Dual Majors  A single degree program withdual majors consists of twomajor programs of studysimultaneously pursued in twoseparate schools/colleges ofthe University.A single degree program with dualmajors requires completion of alldegree requirements in bothschools/colleges, as well asrequirements for a major in eachschool/college or one duallyapproved major.Upon certification by bothschools/colleges, one degree, the degreeassociated with the home school/collegemajor, is conferred. One diploma isawarded, signed by the dean of eachschool/college. Students who wish topursue other dual programs that have notbeen formally established must obtain theprior written permission of both deans. Incases where the academic rules of twoschools/colleges conflict, the policies ofthe home school/college take precedence.Students are enrolled in two schools/colleges,with one designated as the homeschool/college. Schools/Colleges that haveapproved single-degree programs with dualmajors are listed in Table G.Architecture Single degree programs withdual majors are not availableArts and Sciences Students enrolled in asingle degree programs with a dual major37Completion of some dual programs,particularly those with more than twomajors, may require additional credithours.   must earn a minimum of 90 credits in Artsand Sciences. In most cases this will meanthat students enrolled in any Arts andSciences dual program may count only creditearned in Arts and Sciences and the otherschool/college of enrollment toward the totalcredit hours required for the degree.Coursework taken in any other school/college that does not count toward the 90Arts and Sciences credit-hour requirementmay be considered excess credit and willappear on the transcript and will contributeto the cumulative GPA, but it will not counttoward the credit hours required for thedegree.Engineering and Computer ScienceCompletion of a second major withinEngineering and Computer Science requirescompletion of all requirements for eachmajor in addition to the requirements of thedual school/college.Combined Undergraduate Degree Program A combined degree programconsists of two degreeprograms with distinct degreetitles that recognizecompetencies in twoessentially different areaspursued simultaneously in thesame school/college or twodifferent schools/colleges.Concurrent admission to a secondundergraduate degree program isconstrained by NYSED’srestrictions regarding secondundergraduate degrees and review bythe University registrar.Students must meet admissionsrequirements of both degreeprograms.For programs involving twoschools/colleges, students mustfulfill degree requirements in bothschools/colleges.Students in combined programsmust complete 25 percentadditional work beyond the normalrequirements for one of the degrees(this may be either the degree withthe higher or lower credit-hourrequirements, based on theschool's/college's determination),e.g., 30 more credit hours for a120-credit hour degree.The additional credits must be SUcredit as defined under theResidency Requirement. Transferand other credit may be acceptedonly if the second degree requiresmore than 25 percent additionalcredits, and such credit is applied inexcess of the 25 percent additionalcredits.Two degrees and two diplomas areconferred. The combined programs maybe two undergraduate degree programs oran undergraduate and a graduate degreeprogram. See Table H for a list ofcombined undergraduate-graduate degreeprograms.Students pursuing a B.A. degree will not beadmitted to a second B.A. degree programin the same school/college. Approval foradmission to a second B.S. degree programrequires a significant difference in overalldegree requirements between the twoprograms.The awarding of the second degree may beeither concurrent with, or subsequent to,the awarding of the first.Programs available as a single degree withdual majors (see Table G) are not available ascombined degree programs.There is one formally establishedundergraduate combined program:Arts and Sciences and Engineering andComputer Science B.A. (or B.S., by petition)in Arts and Sciences and B.S. in Engineeringand Computer Science.Students who wish to pursue othercombinations of undergraduate degreeprograms must obtain the prior writtenpermission of both deans.TABLE G Single Degree Programs with Dual MajorsHome School/CollegeDual School/CollegeType of DegreeArts and SciencesEducationB.A. or B.S.*38Arts and SciencesPublic CommunicationsB.A. or B.S.*EducationSport and Human DynamicsB.S.Engineering and Computer ScienceInformation StudiesB.S.Information StudiesManagementB.S.ManagementPublic CommunicationB.S.Public CommunicationsInformation StudiesB.S.Visual and Performing ArtsEducationB.F.A. or B.Mus.* Students pursuing a B.S. degree in Arts and Sciences must petition the department offering the major to be formally accepted as candidates.Second Undergraduate DegreesIf you previously earned a bachelor’s degree at SU or another institution, you may or may not be admissible to a second undergraduate degree program,depending on the disciplinary and professional “proximity” of the completed and proposed programs. NYSED has ruled that “the conferral of twobachelor’s or associate degrees should be reserved as a means of recognizing that a candidate has competencies in two essentially different areas: when asecond degree, as opposed to one degree with a double major, is academically justifiable and when the second degree requires one-fourth additional work (i.e.,30 credit hours for a 120-credit hour degree).”The University registrar, in consultation with the associate provost for academic programs and appropriate academic advisors, will decide whetheradmission to a second undergraduate degree program is in accord with NYSED’s criteria. If you earned a B.A. degree you will not be admitted to a secondB.A. degree program that falls within the same SU school/college (or comparable school/college, if the first degree was earned elsewhere), due to thesignificant overlap of degree requirements. Approval for admission to a second B.S. degree program requires a significant difference in overall degreerequirements between the two degree programs. Students who meet these criteria must also meet all admissions requirements of the program to which theyapply. Students whose first degree was earned at Syracuse University must file an Application for Readmission, available from the admitting school/collegeoffice. Students with first degrees from other institutions follow the normal admission application procedure.A minimum of 30 credits for a second undergraduate degree must be Syracuse University credit, as defined under the Residency Requirement. Transfer andother credit may be accepted only if the second degree requires more than 25 percent additional credits, and such credit is applied in excess of the 25percent additional credits.At the time of matriculation in the second undergraduate degree, any courses previously taken as a non-matriculated student at SU will be entered on theundergraduate record, if they do not already appear there. This coursework will calculate toward credit hour and grade point totals on the undergraduaterecord.The official Syracuse University transcript record for students with a prior SU undergraduate degree is cumulative, i.e., courses and grades for allundergraduate work, regardless of the degree program to which they apply, appear on one transcript with cumulative totals. The home school/college forthe second undergraduate degree manually maintains and monitors the record of work related to the second degree. Calculations for satisfactory academicperformance, honors, etc., are derived from the school/college or departmental records and may not be reflected on the official transcript. TABLE H Combined Undergraduate/Graduate Degree ProgramsRequirementsNotesSchool/College InformationUndergraduate/Graduate Teacher Preparation Degree ProgramsStudents must fully meet the combinedrequirements for both degrees.Undergraduate students are accepted in thecombined program through a  two-step process:an initial declaration, then an application prior totheir first graduate semester.  Graduate status isrequired in the 5th year of study, for the two finalsemesters.  Both degrees are awardedconcurrently.Graduate courses taken in the first four years thatcount toward fulfillment of graduate requirementsare removed from calculation on theundergraduate record and transferred as a block ofcredits to the graduate record, where the creditsapply but grades do not calculate toward theGPA.  However, these grades will be used inmanually calculating the GPA for all graduatecredits toward the Master's degree, to assure thatthe minimum 3.0 requirement has been met. Arts and Sciences/Education B.A./M.S. 5-yearTeacher Preparation programsUndergraduate and Other Non-Law Graduate Degree Program 39Students must fully meet the requirements for bothdegrees.Students are accepted for graduate study aftercompletion of the third year of study but are notfully matriculated as graduate students untilbachelor’s degree requirements have been met.The undergraduate degree is awarded beforecompletion of the graduate degree. Graduatecourses taken in the fourth year of study counttoward fulfillment of both undergraduate andgraduate degree requirements. The graduatecourses are included in the undergraduate tuitionand appear only on the undergraduate record, andgrades calculate only toward the undergraduateGPA. A block of transfer credits labeled as“transferred from SU undergraduate record”appears on the graduate record, if needed, andapplies credit hours toward the graduate degree.There are two  formally established combinedprograms:Engineering and Computer Science B.S. and M.S. inComputer Science; B.S. and M.B.A.Students who wish to pursue other combinations ofundergraduate and graduate degree programs mustobtain the prior written permission of both deans.  Undergraduate and Law Graduate Degree Program Students must fully meet the requirements for bothdegrees.In this program, students matriculate in the lawprogram after completion of the third year ofundergraduate study. Courses taken in the firstyear of law study count toward fulfillment of bothundergraduate and law degree requirements. Theyare billed at the College of Law tuition rate andappear only on the law record, and gradescalculate only toward the law GPA. A block oftransfer credits labeled as “transferred from SUlaw record” appears on the undergraduate recordand applies credit hours toward the undergraduatedegree. The undergraduate degree is awardedbefore completion of the graduate degree. Other Simultaneous Pursuit of Undergraduate and Graduate Degrees In exceptional circumstances requiring approvalof the academic department and the GraduateSchool, undergraduate students may be formallyaccepted into a graduate degree program prior tocompletion of undergraduate degree requirements.The status of the student, i.e., whether she/he isconsidered an undergraduate- or graduate-levelstudent, will be determined upon acceptance tothe graduate program. For students who areconsidered to be undergraduates until completionof undergraduate requirements, courses whichapply to the graduate degree will be flagged on theundergraduate record to remove them fromcalculation there and transferred as a block ofcredit to the graduate record. For students whoare considered to be graduate students, coursestaken to fulfill undergraduate degree requirementswill be flagged on the graduate record to removethem from calculation there and transferred as ablock of credit to the undergraduate record. Inboth cases, only the credit (i.e., not grades) forthe flagged courses will be calculated on therecord. Undergraduate Certificate ProgramsA matriculated student who is studying for a certificate must satisfactorily complete a program of study of not less than 12 credits that is approved by theacademic unit and by NYSED.Degree CertificationSchool/college officials certify to the Registrar’s Office that degree and certificate requirements have been completed. This process generally takes four tosix weeks after degree requirements have been completed. Degrees are awarded for the official date following the completion of degree requirements; thedegree award dates fall in May, June or July, August, and December. Only courses that are an integral part of your degree program will be credited toward40graduation requirements, in compliance with NYSED requirements.The University Senate recommends to the SU Board of Trustees the listing of candidates who will meet all requirements for degrees and certificates ofadvance study by the appropriate commencement date each year.Note: Participating in convocation and commencement ceremonies doesn’t imply that degree requirements have been completed.You must file a diploma request through MySlice (myslice.syr.edu) no later than the beginning of your last semester of study.Diplomas And CertificatesDiplomas are ordered after program completion has been certified by schools/colleges and posted by the Registrar’s Office. You will receive yourdiploma/certificate four to six weeks after the certification/posting process has been completed.

Grades And Grading Symbols - Additional Information Letter GradesUndergraduate StudentsYou may have the option to elect a letter grade in a pass/fail-graded course. When permissible, you must select that option by the grading option deadline,and you may not rescind the selection after the deadline.I (Incomplete)You may request an Incomplete if you have exceptional circumstances that prevent you from fulfilling all course requirements on time. You will need yourinstructor’s approval, and will need to have completed enough course content to have a grade assigned based on your work to date. An Incomplete is notavailable if you have not completed enough work on which to base a grade. Check with the appropriate instructor about deferred exams and any otherrequirements. If you take a leave of absence or are withdrawn from the University, you can’t receive Incompletes for courses in which you were registered.Complete a “Request for Incomplete Grade” form, which is an agreement between you and your instructor that specifies the reasons, conditions, and timelimit for removing the Incomplete from your record. An Incomplete will calculate as an F in your GPA. As a function of the agreement, your instructor willcalculate a grade for you based on work completed to date, counting unsubmitted work as zero. This is the grade you will receive if a “Removal ofIncomplete Grade” form is not submitted to the Registrar’s Office by the appropriate deadline. AU (Audit)You may audit courses with instructor approval. You must select the audit option by the grading option deadline, and cannot rescind the selection after thedeadline. Audited courses are non-credit, do not meet any degree requirements, and aren’t counted toward enrollment status. Instructors may record agrading symbol of NA instead of AU if you don’t meet stated academic or attendance requirements. You will have limited access to SU library resources ifyou are auditing a class and are not registered for any credit classes for the term. Courses that require a Proposal for Independent Study, studio art or appliedmusic courses offered by the College of Visual and Performing Arts, and University College BPS and LGL courses can’t be audited.NA (Did Not Attend And Did Not Withdraw)An NA is applied when a student either never attends the course, or when participation ended so early in the term that there is no basis for evaluation andthe student fails to drop or withdraw.  If enough work is completed to establish an evaluation, a course grade will be calculated on the basis of worksubmitted. Unsubmitted work will be counted as zero. If you receive an NA for a course, you will no longer have the option of petitioning for an Incompleteor a letter grade.P/F (Pass/Fail)42Credit is earned for courses with a P, but not with an F.Note:  Graduate students may only receive pass/fail grades for courses designated as pass/fail.Undergraduate StudentsYou may have the option to elect a pass/fail grade for some courses. You must select this option by the grading option deadline, and you may not rescindthe selection after the deadline. School/college-specific pass/fail rules are listed in the table below. Some additional points:If you select a pass/fail option, grades of A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, and D are converted to P. No grade other than P or F will be reported by theRegistrar’s Office.If you choose to major in a field in which you previously took a course as pass/fail, your home school/college and the chair of the department inwhich you took the course will determine whether and upon what terms the course can be used to satisfy departmental requirements.SU Abroad students are limited to one pass/fail course each semester.No more than 24 credit hours of courses taken pass/fail may be applied toward an undergraduate degree.Undergraduate StudentsSchool/College RulesArchitectureAll courses taken to fulfill the architectural professional program requirementsmust receive a letter grade. Only open electives may be taken pass/fail.Arts and SciencesLiberal Arts Core, major and minor classes cannot be taken pass/fail.EducationSome courses must be taken pass/fail (e.g., "

Dual programs within theSchool of Education require study in a content area and professional education courses (including field experiences), as well as satisfaction of collegerequirements. They all lead to New York State initial teacher certification.Students must enroll in both the School of Education and the cooperating college. Dual programs are available in cooperation with the College of Arts andSciences, the College of Visual and Performing Arts, and the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics. Students typically complete oneprogram offered jointly by the two colleges and, in the case of dual programs with Arts and Sciences, a major in the college reflecting the subject to betaught.TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAM FOR BIRTH-2ND GRADE OFFERED WITH THE David B.

If a student has not completed all courserequirements by the time the instructor must report final grades, then the grade is determined based on work completed to date, counting unsubmitted workas zero, unless the student has made prior arrangements to receive an Incomplete.Missing GradesMissing grades do not calculate toward the GPA. You may graduate with missing grades.  After a degree has been certified, a missing grade may be recordedonly if your home school/college determines that you completed all coursework before the degree award date, and only the evaluation and grade submissionoccurred after that date.  Recording of a missing grade after a degree has been certified is subject to the approval of the University Registrar.43Changing GradesAn instructor may elect to submit a grade change after the grade has already been reported. Grade changes must be reported to the department chair, thedean of the student’s home school/college, and the Registrar’s Office. Any or all of those offices may require an explanation of the change, and may requirethat additional information or forms be provided. All changes involving grading symbols must adhere to University policies and procedures. The Registrar’sOffice has final authority to approve changes that involve grading symbols.  After a degree has been certified, a grade change may be recorded only if yourhome school/college determines that you completed all coursework before the degree award date, and only the evaluation and grade change submissionoccurred after that date.  Recording of a grade change after a degree has been certified is subject to the approval of the University Registrar.Grades may also be changed in the following circumstances:HEOP or SSSP students who receive grades of D or F during the Summer Start program will have these grades recorded as WD on the transcript; bypetition a grade of C- may be changed to a WD.Engineering and Computer Science students in the Summer Start program may petition to have grades of C- or lower changed to WD.Removal Of IncompleteIncomplete (I) grades may be removed prior to graduation in one of two ways:complete the outstanding work specified on the Request for Incomplete Grade form by the agreed-upon date; orif you fail to complete the work specified in the Request for Incomplete Grade form, the Registrar’s Office will post the letter grade indicated bythe “If not completed …” statement, subject to any previous grading option that had been selectedAlthough you may not register for a course a second time for the purpose of removing an Incomplete grade, an instructor may require you to repeat certainelements of a course in order to remove the Incomplete.Incompletes and GraduationYou may graduate with outstanding Incompletes, if you’ve earned the required number of credits and met all degree requirements, and if your cumulativeaverage equals or exceeds the minimum requirements for your school/college, with the Incompletes calculated as Fs.After your degree has been certified, a grade may replace an Incomplete only when your home school/college determines that you completed all courseworkbefore the degree award date, with only the evaluation and grade submission occurring after that date. Recording of the grade change from I to earned gradeafter a degree has been certified is subject to the approval of the University Registrar.Grade AppealsNormal Practice for Course Grade Appeals  The following set of general statements represents normal practice at SU* for a student seeking resolution to agrievance of a course grade.1. The assignment of grades at SU is the responsibility of the faculty; once assigned by a member of the faculty, a grade cannot be changed without hisor her consent, except by due process as detailed below. In cases where the instructor of record is not a member of the faculty, the faculty membercharged with oversight of that instructor is ultimately responsible for the assignment of grades.2. A course grade is based upon the instructor’s professional assessment of the academic quality of the student’s performance on a body of work. Suchassessments are non-negotiable, and disputes about them do not constitute valid grounds for an appeal. Valid grounds can arise, e.g., when aninstructor fails to provide or implement uniform and consistent standards, or bases an assessment on criteria other than academic performance.*3. Unless there are issues of a personal nature, the appeal process for a grade dispute begins with the instructor of record. Failure to comply with thismay be grounds for denial of subsequent appeals. Any appeal beyond the instructor of record must be initiated in writing to the department chairbefore the last day of classes of the academic year semester immediately following the one in which the aggrieved grade was received by theRegistrar. This written appeal should describe the basis for the grievance, the informal steps taken to resolve the dispute, and the remedies sought.4. If satisfaction is not obtained at this or any subsequent level, the appeal always moves to the next level of authority. The levels in succession are:the instructor of record, faculty member in charge of the course, the department chair of the faculty member, the dean of the department chair.5. At each level of appeal, a fair and thorough hearing of all views is sought before a decision is made. This may, but need not, require a face-to-facemeeting of the parties directly involved in the dispute. A decision may be reached if both student and instructor agree. If such a decision cannot bereached, a panel designed by the college for this purpose shall hear the case. Details of the operation and manner of selection of this panel mayvary by school or college**, but shall conform to the following guidelines:a. The panel shall have a quorum of at least three.b. All voting members of the panel shall be tenured faculty.c. No member of the panel shall hear a case who has been involved in a previous stage of the appeal.d. Membership of the panel shall be fixed and made public in a given academic year, though replacements may be made in the event of resignations.e. Membership of the panel shall be approved by the faculty of the school or college, or by a representative group of the faculty, in each academicyear.f. The Senate Committee on Instruction shall approve the manner of selection and charge of a school or college’s panel before its first case. Thecommittee shall also approve any subsequent changes in the manner of selection or charge of each college or school’s panel. The panel may, at itsdiscretion, meet with the aggrieved parties either separately or together. The decision of this panel, either to deny the student’s original appeal orto authorize the Registrar to change the grade, shall be final. The panel shall inform both the student and the instructor of its decision in writing.The panel shall also summarize the case and its outcome in a written report to the Senate Committee on Instruction. Said committee may includesummary statistics on grade disputes in its final report to the Senate.6. The only grounds for any further appeal shall be irregularities in the above procedures.447. In such cases, either party may appeal the final decision of the faculty panel to the Senate Committee on Instruction. The Senate Committee onInstruction may either deny the appeal or insist that the procedure begin anew at the point the irregularity occurred.8. All stages of the appeal process shall be kept confidential to the maximum extent possible, consistent with the Family Educational Rights andPrivacy Act.* For further guidance, consult the bylaws of the individual school or college.** These procedures do not apply for students in the College of Law.Grade Point AverageSU grade point average (GPA) is calculated by taking the number of grade points earned and dividing by the number of credit hours carried toward the GPA.Various GPAs, e.g. cumulative GPA and semester GPAs are calculated and used for a variety of purposes.  Schools/colleges can advise about GPA calculationsused to determine satisfactory progress, etc.  See TABLES I and J for grade and grade symbol listings and their associated grade point calculations. Missinggrades are not counted in GPA calculation. GPA average is calculated to three decimal places.  GPA is not rounded.GraduationUndergraduate students must earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 in order to be awarded an SU degree. Graduate students must earn a minimum averageof 3.0 for work comprising the program for the degree or certificate and a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.8.HonorsThe University recognizes exceptional undergraduate achievement through various honors. Certain honors are imprinted on transcripts and diplomas afterdegree certification.Dean's ListUndergraduate StudentsFull-time students are eligible for the dean’s list of their home school/college at the end of each semester.School/CollegeRequirementArchitectureMinimum GPA of 3.500 for 12-14 letter-graded credit hours taken on campus or aminimum GPA of 3.200 for 15 or more letter-graded credit hours taken on campus.Arts and Sciences, Education, Engineering and Computer Science,Information Studies, Management, Sport and Human Dynamics, andVisual and Performing ArtsMinimum GPA of 3.400 and a minimum of 12 credit hours of letter grades with nomissing or Incomplete grades.ManagementMinimum GPA of 3.600 and a minimum of 12 credit hours of letter grades with nomissing or incomplete grades.Public CommunicationsMinimum GPA of 3.500 and a minimum of 12 credit hours of letter grades with nomissing or Incomplete grades.University CollegeUC students are eligible for the dean's list at the end of each semester (excludingsummer) if they earn a 3.400 GPA in the last 12 credit hours taken and have beenenrolled in consecutive semesters.

School/College RulesArts and Sciences, Information Studies, and ManagementUniversity honors is based on a minimum of 60 credit hoursof letter-graded courses taken at SU.University CollegeAssociate’s degree recipients are not eligible for Universityhonors.Departmental DistinctionStudents earn distinction in particular programs of study by meeting the specific criteria for distinction in that major. Departmental or program distinctionrecognizes exceptional achievement that exceeds normal expectations for graduates within the program. This will be noted on the transcript after thedegree has been awarded.Internal TransferGraduate StudentsGraduate students may change their degree program if the transfer is approved by the new program. Graduate students wishing to initiate any kind of changein degree program, whether transferring between programs or undertaking concurrent graduate degree programs, must consult their funding sources as to theeffect the proposed change may have on their eligibility for continued funding.Intra-University TransferUndergraduate StudentsStudents transferring to other schools/colleges within the University (intra-University transfer) must meet the admission requirements of the newschool/college that were in effect at the time of matriculation into the University. Submit internal transfer requests well before the start of the nextsemester to allow adequate review/processing time. Check with the appropriate school/college undergraduate office, as intra-University transfer deadlinedates vary. Until your IUT is approved, you may not be able to register for courses in the new program. See TABLE K for school/college-specificinformation.The new school/college of enrollment will re-evaluate all SU, transfer, and other credit you have received. If you were previously matriculated at SUNY ESFand took SU courses during that time, your school/college, at its discretion, may include those SU courses in manual calculations for determination of intra-University transfer eligibility.Full-time students transferring to University College may register for up to 11 credit hours during the first semester after the transfer. Students registered ina main campus school/college during the spring semester may not transfer to University College for the purpose of summer study.TABLE K Intra-University Transfer Standards NewSchool/CollegeConditionsArchitecture3.0 GPA.

Admission for all programs on a space available basis.Leave Of Absence, Withdrawal And Readmission If you leave the University before completing your degree requirements, you must file for an official leave of absence, whether or not you intend to returnto SU.  If you register but then leave without notifying the University, you will continue to incur tuition, room, board, and other charges. On yourtranscript, course registrations will remain and any grades or grading symbols submitted by your instructors will appear.  If you don’t register at all, thenotation “Discontinuation -- non-attendance” will appear on your transcript.  Discontinued students must follow formal readmission procedures.Leave Of AbsenceUndergraduates initiate the leave of absence process through their school/college undergraduate office. Graduate students file an Official Leave ofAbsence/Withdrawal form through their academic department. A leave of absence is not available to a student who has a pending disciplinary action.Medical Leaves of AbsenceStudents leaving the University for medical and/or psychological reasons must go through the Office of Student Assistance, 306 Steele Hall, and obtainapproval of Health Services and/or the Counseling Center for a medical leave to take effect. If extraordinary circumstances exist, you may apply to theappropriate department/school/college for retroactive approval of a medical leave of absence. This application must be made within 60 days of your lastdate of class attendance.Military Leaves of AbsenceUndergraduates being activated by the military should initiate a leave of absence procedure through the home school/college undergraduate office; graduatestudents should contact their academic department. The dean’s office or academic department will advise about options to drop courses, take class standinggrades, or take Incompletes, as well as the academic implications of these options. WithdrawalSU will officially withdraw students who are suspended for academic or disciplinary reasons; the suspending school/college or the Division of Student Affairswill initiate the withdrawal. A student who chooses to leave the University rather than participate in the judicial or academic integrity review process will beclassified as having been withdrawn for disciplinary reasons.  The University may also withdraw students for medical reasons or for academic integrityviolations. Officially withdrawn students lose matriculation status; however, matriculation may be reinstated if all requirements for readmission are met (see“Readmission/Termination of Leave of Absence”).Enforced Medical Withdrawal   An enforced medical withdrawal may be imposed in response to behavior that has its basis in a psychological or othermedical condition including, but not limited to, situations in which a student fails to attend and participate actively in an appropriate assessment,educational program, or other intervention; and situations in which student behavior poses a significant health or safety risk to the student or others. Thesenior vice president and dean of student affairs, or one or more of her/his designees will make the determination that an enforced medical withdrawalshould occur, consistent with the process enumerated in the University Judicial System Handbook. Academic and Financial Implications of Leaves and Withdrawals   For academic and financial purposes, the effective date is either the date theOfficialWithdrawal/Leave of Absense form is approved by the undergraduate home school/college or the graduate student’s department, or the day after the end ofthe current semester, whichever is later.47You can’t receive Incomplete grades for courses in which you were enrolled if you take a leave of absence or are withdrawn; only grades of WD or F can berecorded on your transcript. If you register for a future semester and subsequently take a leave of absence or are withdrawn, then your registration for thatsemester will be canceled.   Transcript Notation and Effective Date   Leaves of absence and withdrawals will be noted by effective date on the transcript. The transcript notation forleaves of absence is “Leave of Absence-- Student Initiated,” and for withdrawals, “Withdrawal-- University Initiated.” The transcript will be marked with“violation of academic integrity policy” when an established violation results in suspension or expulsion. This designation will be permanently retained onthe transcript.  You are responsible for initiating any requests for refund, including those that result from medical leaves. See TABLE L and Tuition, Fees and RelatedPolicies for the complete statement of SU’s policy and requirements for refunds for withdrawals and leaves of absence.TABLE L Academic And Financial Effects Of Dropping Or Withdrawing From A Course, Leaves Of Absence, And WithdrawalFrom The UniversityActionDateEffect onTranscriptEffect on Financial AidEffect on Tuition and FeesDrop a class, take a leaveof absence, or bewithdrawn from theUniversityOn or before the financial drop deadline (in fall andspring, three weeks from the first day of classes forregular session or the class-specific deadline forflexible format classes)Class(es)droppedFor leaves and withdrawals,all financial aid is canceled.All charges, except thenonrefundable portion,will be refunded.¹Drop a class, take a leaveof absence, or bewithdrawn from theUniversityAfter the financial drop deadline and on or before theacademic drop deadline of the class 3Class(es)dropped 2For leaves and withdrawals,see footnote.1  Noadjustments are made forindividual dropped classes..For individual dropped classes,all charges remain.

Approval of your readmission may be affected by any of the following conditions:Your school/college and program must have available space to accommodate your inclusion.You may need to satisfy new requirements in your academic program or even change your major, depending upon curricular changes that may haveoccurred during your absence.  Your school/college and/or department will determine the available options.You must meet all outstanding SU financial obligations.If your leave/withdrawal was conditional, you must resolve the appropriate issues and obtain readmission approval from the academic unit or officethat authorized or required your leave/withdrawal.If you left the University without requesting an official Leave of Absence, you must follow formal readmission procedures as set by your school/college.After you’re readmitted, you may register for the upcoming semester during the regular registration period, during the schedule adjustment period prior tothe start of the semester, or on the registration day for new students at the beginning of the new semester.Undergraduate StudentsIf you are applying for readmission following an academic withdrawal:48Arts and Sciences, Education, Public Communications, Sport and Human Dynamics, and Visual and Performing Arts students are eligible to applyfor readmission after one academic year from the date of an academic withdrawal.  In addition, some Sport and Human Dynamics students may beeligible for fast-track readmission (see the college's policies).Other schools/colleges allow readmission applications after one calendar year from the date of an academic withdrawal.Your school/college may place you on academic probation for the first semester after you are readmitted.If you are readmitted to SU, you will regain your matriculation status, unless you are readmitted to University College as a special student.Special Student Status  After an academic dismissal, with home school/college and University College approval, you may apply for readmission and transferto University College as a special student. Special students are limited to a maximum registration of six credit hours in the first semester at UniversityCollege. You may apply for readmission and transfer to a main campus school/college after earning a minimum of 12-15 credits with a minimum cumulativeGPA of 2.0.Arts and Sciences students must obtain permission from Arts and Sciences before applying for special student status through University College. Thisprocess requires an interview and a contract.  MajorsUndergraduate StudentsA major program consists of a minimum number of credit hours of junior- and senior-level courses in a formally approved program of study. The purposeof the major is to provide depth of knowledge and competence in a subject area of special interest. You must declare a major and complete all requirementsof the major in order to earn an SU degree.Each school/college determines the courses, number of credit hours, and other requirements for its major programs of study. You must apply for and beaccepted into a major by the beginning of your junior year. If you don’t officially declare a major by the start of the registration period at the end of thefirst semester of your junior year, you will be prevented from registering for the next term. In the following schools/colleges the indication of intended major on the application for admission and/or intra-University transfer is unofficial. School/CollegeNotesArts and SciencesThere are specific procedures for being formally admitted to a major. Students declaring a major areconsidered to be pursuing the B.A. (Bachelor of Arts) degree. Students who wish to pursue the B.S.(Bachelor of Science) degree in Arts and Sciences must petition the department offering the major tobe formally accepted as a candidate. Of the upper-division credits counted toward the completion of amajor, at least 12 must be SU letter-graded course work.Management, Visual and Performing Arts,University College There are specific procedures for being formally admitted to a major.TABLE M Double Majors (In Single Degree Programs)School/College NotesArchitectureStudents may not have a double major.Arts and SciencesA maximum of six credits of coursework at the 300 level or above mayoverlap among all majors and minors. For each major program, all but sixcredits of upper-division coursework counted toward that major must beexclusive to that major. Arts and Sciences students who pursue a major inanother school/college must earn a minimum of 96 credits in the College ofArts and Sciences.Engineering and Computer ScienceCompletion of a second Engineering and Computer Science major within thecollege requires completion of all program of study requirements for eachmajor. Students pursuing any combination of double majors where one orboth are Engineering and Computer Science majors must complete theEngineering and Computer Science programs of study in their entirety.ManagementTo complete a double major in Management, students complete all requiredcourses for each major. Courses that are applicable to multiple majors mayonly be used to fulfill the requirements of one major. General ManagementStudies cannot be one of the majors in a double major program forManagement students. Double majors outside Management usually requirecompletion of additional credits. Management majors are not available to singly enrolled students in otherschools/colleges.Public CommunicationsPublic Communications students may only have one major in the School ofPublic Communications. 49Public Communications majors are not available to singly enrolled students inother schools/colleges.MinorsUndergraduate StudentsMinors provide a systematic opportunity to focus on an area of interest. Minors may be required as part of a degree program, or they may be selectedvoluntarily. Because of limited space in high-demand courses, admission to some minors may be restricted.  The proportion of liberal arts and sciencescourses required for the degree must be maintained, and minors that are too closely related to your major will not be approved. Minors require a minimum of18 credit hours, 12 of which must be in 300- to 400-level coursework. School/College RulesSchool/collegeRulesArts and SciencesAt least 15 of the credit hours for a minor must be SU letter-graded coursework. A maximum of sixcredits of coursework at the 300 level or above may overlap among all majors and minors. For eachmajor or minor program, all but six credits of upper-division coursework counted towardrequirements must be exclusive to that program.EducationMinors must be declared by the end of the junior year or 6th semester of study.ManagementNormally, at least 15 of the credit hours for a minor must be SU letter-graded coursework.Exceptions are granted by petition only.The department or school/college offering the minor determines the requirements, and any exception to the minor requirements must be granted bypetition through the sponsoring unit.Once your school/college has certified completion of both your degree and your minor, the minor will appear on the transcript. RegistrationYou must be officially registered in order to attend classes. You may not attend, audit, be evaluated or otherwise participate in courses without beingofficially enrolled. An instructor may not allow you to attend classes and/or submit work unless your name appears on the official class list or unless you areattending with the instructor's approval for the purpose of making up an Incomplete. Registration may be prevented for financial, academic, or otherreasons.You must register for classes in the semester in which you begin work for those classes. You may not attend a class without officially registering, and thenregister for the class as if it were taken in a subsequent term, either for financial reasons or for scheduling convenience. Advisors and faculty should notadvise such actions, and students are held to the policy even if such advice or permission is given. If you do not register appropriately and grades are laterreported for recording on your transcript, you’ll be dropped from the later course registration and retroactively registered in the term during which youactually took the course. The Bursar’s Office will adjust tuition and fees to those in effect at that time.The same rule also applies to internships taken for credit, independent study, experience credit, etc.: You must register during the semester or summersession in which work begins. Retroactive registration is not permitted for such work done without faculty oversight.Before you register, you will need to clear all holds. If outstanding bills are not paid by Aug. 1 for fall semester, and by Dec. 15 for spring semester, yourearly registration for the next semester may be canceled and you will be unable to re-register until the semester begins. Your current semester’s registrationmay be canceled if you have not met the University’s immunization requirements.New students register just before the term begins. Returning students are eligible to register for the next semester during the registration period at the end offall and spring semesters. Part-time students register through University College or, for the School of Education’s Extended Campus courses, throughExtended Campus. Adding of courses or entire registrations after the late registration and add deadline may be done by petition only.SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and SUNY Upstate Medical University Courses: Because of the University’s relationship with SUNYESF and SUNY UMU, you may take courses at those institutions with the approval of your SU school/college/academic department, subject to availabilityand fulfillment of any specific requirements. Conversely, SUNY ESF and SUNY UMU students who meet course requirements may take SU courses, subjectto availability and in accordance with the rules and approval of their home institution.Maximum Course Load (Fall And Spring)Graduate StudentsThe maximum course load for graduate students is 15 credits each semester.  In some part-time programs the maximum course load may be lower. Registration for additional credits requires a petition and approval of your academic department.Undergraduate Students50Full-time undergraduate students typically register for 12-19 credits per semester. Students in good standing in the Renée Crown University Honors Programmay register for more than 19 credits without approval of their home school/college. Other students may petition their home school/college to register formore than 19 credits. Undergraduates registering for more than 19 credit hours will be assessed the appropriate extra tuition charges, unless they qualify foran overload rate exception. Summer RegistrationUniversity College coordinates all summer registration for returning and visiting students. Matriculated SU students in good academic standing, as well asvisiting and non-matriculated students, are eligible to register for summer sessions. Undergraduate students who were full-time during the spring semester andwho intend to register as full-time during the fall semester may not transfer to part-time continuing education status for the summer.Maximum Course Load (Summer)Graduate StudentsGraduate students may register for a maximum of 6 credits in a six-week session (with Maymester and Summer Session I considered as one session for thispurpose), and a maximum of 12 credits in any summer.  In some full-time programs the maximum course load may be higher and in some part-timeprograms the maximum course load may be lower.  Registration for credits above the maximum set by your program requires a petition and approval ofyour academic department.Undergraduate StudentsUndergraduates may register for a maximum of 7 credits in a six-week session (with Maymester and Summer Session I considered as one session for thispurpose), and a maximum of 14 credits in any summer.  Students may petition their home school/college to register for additional credits in a session or forsummer.Graduate Students Taking Undergraduate-Level CoursesPrior to registration, graduate students may petition to register for an undergraduate-level course, with the exception of PED courses, which do not require apetition. An undergraduate course taken by a graduate student appears on the graduate section of the transcript with a notation to indicate the course isundergraduate-level and, unless flagged to remove it from calculation, the course counts toward overall credit and GPA calculations on the transcript.However, an undergraduate-level course does not fulfill graduate degree requirements.Undergraduates Taking Graduate-Level CoursesRegistration for a graduate-level course is subject to a variety of restrictions, depending upon how the course is intended to apply toward your undergraduateor graduate degree requirements. Taking a graduate course as restricted graduate credit, with the intention of later applying it toward a graduate degree orcertificate program, requires prior approval.A graduate course taken by an undergraduate appears on the undergraduate section of the transcript with a notation to indicate the course is graduate level,and the course counts toward overall undergraduate credit and GPA calculations. However, a graduate-level course neither fulfills undergraduate degreerequirements (unless it has specifically been approved for that purpose, either as part of the degree program’s requirements or by petition prior toregistration), nor does it count toward calculations for certification, e.g., for University honors.Changes To RegistrationYou may make changes to your registration after the semester begins, adding, dropping, or withdrawing from classes in accordance with published deadlines.Courses with nontraditional start and/or end dates have different deadlines than full-semester courses. While the student normally initiates registration andsubsequent changes, the student’s school(s)/college(s) of enrollment may also initiate such actions. Instructors also have the option to administratively dropstudents who do not attend the first week of classes (up to and including the add deadline). The administrative drop option for instructors is not available inMaymester.The Health Center or the Bursar’s Office may cancel your registration. No other University persons or units may make substantive changes to anundergraduate student’s schedule of classes without first securing the formal permission of your home school/college.Religious Observances, Policy OnSU recognizes the diverse faith traditions represented among its campus community and supports the rights of faculty, staff, and students to observeaccording to these traditions. Students are asked to consider that it is more difficult to arrange appropriate accommodations in some kinds of courses, e.g.,those that have certain kinds of laboratories or a significant experiential learning component, so students should consider their need for accommodation forreligious observances as they plan their schedule each semester. Students should recall that not every course is offered every academic year and that thecatalog indicates how frequently each course is offered.Faculty are asked to make appropriate accommodation for students' observance needs by providing an opportunity to make up any examination, study, orwork requirement that is missed because of an absence due to a religious observance, provided the instructor has been notified no later than the end of thesecond week of classes. No fees will be charged to the student for the costs incurred by the University for such make-up work. If a faculty member isunwilling or unable to make an appropriate accommodation, the student should consult his or her academic dean.Research Involving Human Or Animal Subjects51Students are required to submit copies of any research proposal that involves human subjects to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review. Noresearch or teaching using live vertebrate animals may be undertaken until the protocol is approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee(IACUC). Residency RequirementAll students must complete a minimum number of credit hours at SU in courses offered through duly registered graduate programs order to be granted aSyracuse University degree. Advanced Credit (AC) exams may not be applied toward the residency requirement.Graduate StudentsMaster’s degree candidates must take at least 70 percent of credit hours for the degree while at SU. See “Calculation of Credit Hours Toward DegreeRequirements” for school/college-specific exceptions.Doctoral students must take at least 50 percent of coursework, exclusive of dissertation, in courses offered through an SU-registered graduate degreeprogram. Experiential learning credit and professional experience courses don’t count toward the residency requirement.Undergraduate StudentsYou must take at least 30 credit hours of coursework at SU to qualify for the degree; in most cases more than 30 credits will be required in order to fulfilldegree requirements. Work necessary to complete a major must be completed at SU unless a waiver is granted by the appropriate major department.SU courses taken while a student is matriculated at SUNY ESF do count toward the residency requirement. ESF courses taken while a student is matriculatedeither at SUNY ESF or at SU do not count toward the SU residency requirement.University College Candidates for associate's degrees, bachelor of liberal studies degrees, or bachelor of professional studies degrees must complete aminimum of 30 credit hours of SU coursework while enrolled as part-time students at University College. Credits earned at SU while enrolled as a full-timestudent do not count toward this requirement.Retaking CoursesSome programs require the retaking of courses in which unsatisfactory grades (as defined by the program) were earned. Retaking courses may also beprohibited under certain circumstances. Language courses  A course cannot be retaken once you have successfully completed a higher level course in the same language.Mathematics courses  A course cannot be retaken once you have completed a higher level course in the same mathematics curriculum sequencewith a grade of C or better.Table A describes other rules for undergraduates who want to retake courses. Also see “Flagging Courses That Have Been Retaken.”  Note that retakencourses may not count toward eligibility and satisfactory progress requirements for certain types of financial aid awards.Graduate StudentsYou may retake a course in which you earned a grade of C+, C, C- or F, with the approval of your academic unit and the Graduate School. Graduate coursesmay be retaken only once. A retaken course replaces the original course on your degree program of study, but both the original course and the retakencourse will appear on your transcript and both courses will calculate, unless the original course is flagged.Student Academic WorkStudent work prepared for University courses in any media may be used for educational purposes, if the course syllabus makes clear that such use may occur.You grant permission to have your work used in this manner by registering for, and by continuing to be enrolled in, courses where such use of student workis announced in the course syllabus.After you have completed such courses, any further use of your work will meet one of the following conditions:the work will be rendered anonymous by removing all of your personal identification, oryour written permission will be secured.As a generally accepted practice, dissertations, graduate theses or research projects, honors theses, or other capstone projects submitted in partialfulfillment of degree requirements are placed in the library, University Archives, or department for public reference.Student Status Enrolled StudentsA student is considered enrolled at the University until one or more of the following occurs:  (1) the student graduates; (2) the student takes a leave ofabsence; (3) the student is withdrawn from the University for academic, medical or disciplinary reasons; (4) the student fails to register; or (5) the student'sregistration is cancelled by the University.52Matriculated StudentsA matriculated student is defined as one who has applied for, been formally admitted to, and has registered for one or more courses in the degree orcertificate-granting program to which he/she has been admitted. You must be matriculated to receive a degree or certificate from the University.Students who take an official leave of absence maintain matriculation status.Non-Matriculated StudentsNon-matriculated students are held to the same academic standards as matriculated students.A non-matriculated graduate student is one who has earned a bachelor's degree at SU or elsewhere, but has not been formally admitted to a degree or C.A.S.program at SU. This status applies whether registering for graduate or undergraduate courses.A non-matriculated undergraduate student is one who has neither earned a bachelor's degree nor been formally admitted to the University.Undergraduates who are academically dismissed from a school/college and accepted into University College as “special students” are considerednon-matriculated.Taking courses at University College does not imply matriculation, since you must be formally admitted to an SU degree program in order tobecome matriculated.Students who are withdrawn from the University become non-matriculated. Upon readmission, matriculation status is regained.Full-Time And Part-Time StatusThe University’s certification of a student’s status is based solely on the criteria stated in this rule.  Students who meet SU’s requirements for full-time orpart-time status may not meet requirements for such status as defined by other agencies or institutions. Conversely, students who do not meet theUniversity’s requirements for full-or part-time status may be considered full-time or part-time by other agencies.Graduate StudentsFull-time A graduate student is considered full time under any one of the following conditions:registered for full-time study (9 credits for fall, spring, or summer in a program approved by the student's advisor)holding an appointment as a graduate assistant or fellow and registered for the semester (fall and spring only)registered for fewer than 9 credits but for at least 0 (zero) credits of thesis, dissertation, or degree in progress for the semester and engaged, at alevel equivalent to full-time study in one or more of the following activities as certified by your program.studying for preliminary, qualifying, or comprehensive examsstudying for a language or tool requirementactively working on a thesis or dissertation an internshipA law student is full-time if enrolled for 12 credits in a fall or spring semester. If matriculated in a joint/dual degree program that includes the J.D. degree,then the law requirement for full-time status takes precedence over the 9 credit criterion for full-time status as stated above.*Syracuse University considers 9 credits per term to be full-time study for graduate study.  The New York State Education Department, based on NYSEducation Law and the Regulations of the Education Commissioner, define full-time study to be 12 credits per semester for educational requirements forstate academic awards and loans.Part-Time (Fall, Spring, and Summer)Graduate students who do not meet the requirements for full-time status are considered part time.Undergraduate StudentsFull-time (Fall, Spring, and Summer)Undergraduates are full time if registered for 12 or more credits during any semester. Registration for 6 credits in a six-week summer session confers full-time status for the session.Part-time (Fall, Spring, and Summer)Undergraduates enrolled for fewer than 12 credit hours are considered to be part time.Exception: Engineering and Computer Science Students registered in the Cooperative Education program for zero hours in semesters when they are on workassignments are considered to be full time.The number of credit hours carried by a part-time student may affect eligibility for University housing and financial aid. For purposes of financial aid,students registered for 9-11 credit hours are considered three-quarter time: students registered for 6-8 credit hours are considered half-time students; studentsregistered for 0-5 credit hours are considered less than half time.TranscriptSU maintains a permanent academic transcript showing complete course and grade-earned information for every student, matriculated or non-matriculated,who takes credit-bearing coursework through any SU program. The transcript may not be modified or selectively deleted for any reason, including ignoranceof deadlines or academic rules. Once a degree is conferred, the transcript may not be changed except for subsequently discovered fraud or academic53dishonesty, assessments that more accurately represent academic work completed prior to degree certification, or to correct administrative error. Inextreme cases, such changes may include the rescinding of a degree.Transcripts of courses taken and degrees received at SU are maintained by the Registrar’s Office in accordance with the policies of the AmericanAssociation of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers. Official transcripts show the entire record of all coursework, both undergraduate and graduate,matriculated and non-matriculated. Undergraduate and graduate transcript records print separately, but are issued and sent together for students with morethan one SU academic career. Coursework is displayed chronologically within each career record, with one GPA calculation for the career. However, withinthat distinction the transcript is not degree-specific: i.e., it does not designate courses that apply to multiple specific degree programs at the same level.Such information may only be obtained from the student’s school/college for undergraduate degrees; the academic department for graduate programs; or theCollege of Law for law degrees.All courses taken at SU Abroad centers are listed on students’ transcripts. Credit hours and grades are computed in the GPA in the same manner as any otherSyracuse University courses. Courses taken through SU Abroad at foreign institutions may be listed on students’ transcripts with credit hours and gradescomputed in the GPA in the same manner as any other Syracuse University course, or as transfer credit, as determined by SU departmental review.SU does not maintain a transcript record of SU courses taken by SUNY ESF students. For ESF students, ESF is the college of record. ESF courses taken bymatriculated SU students appear on the SU transcript and calculate in the same way as SU courses, except for graduate students admitted to concurrentmaster’s degree programs.Syracuse University cannot provide copies of transcripts it has received from other institutions to third parties.  Students must request transcripts from theoriginating institution.Transcripts may be obtained from the Registrar’s Office. SU reserves the right to withhold copies of transcripts of students who have unfulfilled financialobligations to the University or by request of the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities.Access to transcripts and other student records is protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

A minor may be related to your major, or it might be in a completely different academic/professional area. Because a completed minor appearson your transcript, it highlights another dimension of educational background to support an application for graduate study or employment.A minor is a grouping of 6 or more courses, totaling 18 to 21 credits, of which 12 credits must be in 300- to 400-level courses. A minor may be similar toand named for an existing major, such as Chemistry, or it may be an interdisciplinary grouping, like Judaic Studies. The department or college offering theminor determines which courses are required. Some colleges require a formal minor as part of the degree program.Minor courses may or may not fit into the electives of your degree requirements. Your academic advisor or home college undergraduate office can adviseyou on the effect of a minor on your particular degree program, including whether or not you will need to complete more than the normal total number ofcredits.Enrolling in a Minor Pursuing a minor should be discussed with your academic advisor as early in your academic career as possible. You will then complete a Declaration of Minorform, available in your school/college undergraduate office. The form must be signed by the department or college offering the minor and, in some cases,your advisor. Your home college’s undergraduate office will review the paperwork and enter the minor on your student record. A variety of minors offeredby SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry are also available to Syracuse University students. Information about these minors is available at:/2014/schools/ESF/861_undergraduate_programs/minors. Students may request admission into SUNY ESF minors using the same forms and procedures usedfor Syracuse University minors.Information about minors that have enrollment limits or eligibility requirements can be obtained at the sponsoring department/college. The sponsoring unitcan explain specific course requirements and options for the minor. In some cases, a minor must be officially listed on your record for you to be able toregister for certain restricted courses. The department or college offering the minor determines the requirements, and any exception to the minorrequirements must be granted by petition through the sponsoring department/college.After certification by your college for graduation, and if all coursework for the minor is completed, it will appear on your transcript under the college,major, and degree listing as “MINOR IN {title}.”Pursuing More Than One MinorYou may pursue more than one minor if there are enough elective course opportunities in your degree program or if you choose to graduate with additionalcredits. This possibility should be discussed with your academic advisor or school/college undergraduate office.Official MinorsAll current official disciplinary minors are listed on the appropriate school, department, or program pages. Detailed descriptions of requirements for eachminor may be found at the following link http://coursecatalog.syr.edu/2014/programs/minor or by contacting specific departments for minors not describedin this catalog. Interdisciplinary minors within the College of Arts and Sciences and between the College of Arts and Sciences and other schools and collegescan be found here. Please be aware that not all minors are endorsed by all schools and colleges. You should verify that the minor you wish to pursue isaccepted by your home college.

Both programs include a basic course taken during the freshmen and sophomore years, and an advanced course takenduring the junior and senior years. Each program offers commissions in their respective service for men and women who complete the course requirementsand meet other mandatory prerequisites.Students may enroll in the first two years of either program and complete field training or basic camp without incurring any military-service obligation.Uniforms and ROTC textbooks are furnished throughout the programs. Students accepted to the second two years of the programs are given a subsistenceallowance of $450 to $500 a month during each academic year. Two-, three-, and four-year scholarship recipients receive tuition assistance, a bookallowance, lab fees, and a stipend ranging from $300 a month for first-year students to $500 a month for seniors for the duration of their scholarship.Sophomores may receive credit for the basic course by attending a special, expenses-paid, five-week camp during the summer before the junior year.Enrollment in the ROTC program is also available to seniors who expect to go directly into graduate school in a program that requires at least two academicyears to complete, as well as to graduate students who will have four or more semesters remaining at the time of the next fall registration.Academic credit awarded toward graduation requirements for military science and aerospace studies courses is determined by the individual schools andcolleges.Interested students should inquire at the ROTC office of their choice either before or at the start of the academic year or semester. Students may visit theROTC offices in Archbold North.

These courses comprise the professional officer course, and each meets for three hours a week.All academic courses are taught by career Air Force officers who hold at least a bachelor’s degree. These officers are on the University faculty and hold theacademic title of professor or assistant professor for the duration of their assignment.Besides attending academic classes, cadets attend a leadership laboratory each week. The leadership laboratory provides instruction in Air Force customs andcourtesies, drill and ceremonies, expeditionary skills, and briefings on career opportunities. The instruction is conducted by the cadet corps with aprogression of experiences designed to develop leadership potential.During the summer between the sophomore and junior years, cadets attend field training at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. This training is four weekslong. Field training provides each cadet with leadership training, group involvement, physical fitness training, and a chance to experience life in an activeAir Force environment.Juniors in Air Force ROTC are eligible to apply for positions as cadet training assistants or to participate in professional development training programsaround the country. Cadet training assistants attend a field training camp and train and evaluate cadet trainees and execute field training activities.Army Reserve Officer Training CorpsLt. Col. Michael BianchiProfessor of Military Science308 Archbold North, 315-443-2462Students in the Army ROTC program receive instruction in general military science in preparation for commissions as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army,Army Reserve, or Army National Guard. Officer education emphasizes such areas as the duties and responsibilities of junior officers; the understanding ofthe fundamental concepts and principles of military art and science; the development of leadership and management potential; a basic understanding ofassociated professional knowledge; a strong sense of personal integrity, honor, and individual responsibility; and an appreciation of the requirements fornational security.All students participate in a two to four-hour leadership laboratory each week. This period of instruction is largely student-planned and directed andprovides opportunities for realistic leadership experience. It emphasizes leadership, basic military skills, and professional knowledge subjects.In addition to the leadership laboratory, basic-course students (freshmen and sophomore students) receive instruction in physical conditioning, first aid,effective writing, and human behavior. The basic course does not obligate students to any military service and only requires two to three hours a week.After successful completion of basic-course requirements, students can enroll in advanced ROTC, which requires five to eight hours a week.In the junior year cadets prepare for advanced camp, which takes place at an active duty Army base, during the summer between the junior and senior year.Students study military leadership and management, map reading, advanced physical conditioning, military ethics, professionalism, and law. These courses,if cross-listed with other academic courses, may be taken for academic credit.Field training exercises are held once each semester. They introduce a wide range of military skills and stress practical application of classroom instruction.Skills in rappelling, land navigation, tactics, and marksmanship are taught at a variety of field sites in Central New York and Pennsylvania.Aerospace Studies CoursesGENERAL MILITA  MILITARY SCIENCE COURS National Security Forces inContemporary American Society 0-3 YCrosslisted with: "

Salomone, Director323 Hall of Languages, 315-443-1643ilearn.syr.eduThe Undergraduate Research Program (URP), housed in the College of Arts and Sciences but open to qualified participants from other colleges, exists toprovide non-classroom, credit-bearing educational opportunities to undergraduate students. Interested qualified students work closely with Arts and Sciencesfaculty members in faculty-generated research projects, other projects representing the faculty member’s academic interests, learning environmentsprovided by professionals affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences, or eligible off-campus internships with an identified Arts and Sciences advisor.The program features the apprenticeship model, and students gain firsthand experience in creative and investigative academic processes, translate theoryinto practice, explore the cutting edges of particular disciplines, develop closer working relationships with faculty members, and enhance their own careerand educational credentials.FACULTY PARTICIPATIONThe program offers Arts and Sciences faculty members a chance to extend and expand the character of their teaching in the undergraduate context, to workclosely with self-selecting, highly motivated students, to attract excellent students to continued study in their particular field of study, and to open bothinternal and external funding possibilities by way of undergraduate involvement in their work. Faculty members are invited to propose projects to theDirector. Individual projects may extend beyond a semester in length as appropriate. The character and requirements of these projects, as well as thenumber of credits involved, vary greatly, since they come from across the disciplines of the College of Arts and Sciences. The common criterion for all,however, is appropriateness to an educational credit-bearing experience for qualified undergraduate students. 72Guide To Reading Course DescriptionsCourse Numbering SystemThe present system of numbering courses prescribes that all courses use three digits to indicate the course level and/or type of course, and a three-lettersubject to indicate the department or college.The following catalog numbering guidelines indicate the level and type of course:   Remedial and noncredit courses000-099Freshman-level courses100-199Sophomore-level courses200-299Junior- and senior-level courses300-499Joint undergraduate- and graduate-level courses500-599First-year graduate-level courses600-699Second- and third-year graduate-level courses700-899Readings, research, and individual study courses at the doctoral level only900-996Master’s thesis997Individualized study program998Doctoral dissertation999INTERPRETATIONThe first, or left, digit of the course catalog number indicates level.The second, or middle, digit may or may not indicate the study area, depending upon the curriculum structure of the particular department.Glossary of Course SubjectsEach course number is preceded by a three-letter subject that indicates the area of study.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in these areas,and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree. The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts and150Sciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows. Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required. The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

The reasons most often cited are our committed and diverse faculty, our number and variety of study abroadopportunities, and our nationally-accredited, professional degree programs, which provide students the technical skilland the cultural knowledge necessary to practice in an increasingly competitive global marketplace.Consistent with our commitment to prepare students for a world shaped by globalization, the Syracuse School ofArchitecture has created the Global Studio program with facilities and full time faculty in Florence, London and New York. Students may spend up to twosemesters studying full time in each of these programs. In addition, we offer a range of other study abroad options with shorter programs of study inTurkey, Japan, China and India. We are also committed to bringing world-class practitioners and educators to teach and lecture at our home campus inSyracuse. Each semester we organize a visiting lecture series featuring architects and designers from around the world. And, each semester, as part of ourVisiting Critic Program, nationally and internationally recognized professors lead studios on our Syracuse campus.The School of Architecture is equally committed to local and regional engagement projects, and over the last several years we have worked in conjunctionwith the University and the city of Syracuse to develop numerous projects in the city and in the region. Many of these projects have been organized byUpstate, an interdisciplinary design, research and real estate program located in downtown Syracuse, started and run by the Syracuse University School ofArchitecture.Shaped by globalization and rapid technological transformation, the practice of architecture, over the last decade, has undergone dramatic change, placingthe architect, once again, at the center of some of the most defining issues of our time. The School of Architecture at Syracuse University has not onlykept pace with these changes, but our faculty, staff, students and alumni have led and continue to lead the effort to make a better world through the designof better buildings and cities. We invite you to visit and to join us.Michael Speaks, Ph.D.Dean, School of ArchitectureEducational Mission Program MissionAs a professional-degree-granting college within a research university, the School of Architecture at Syracuse University is dedicated tocreating a rich academic environment marked by the confluence of advanced practice, contemporary theory, and social engagement. Ourprimary goal is to help students develop the capacity and judgment necessary to understand the built environment and generatearchitecture as a critical response, so that each student can engage both the discipline of architecture and the multiple discourses—artistic,technological, social, political, environmental, economic—necessary to be a successful practitioner and a conscientious citizen. Throughour teaching and public programming, we help students gain a deep knowledge of architecture’s techniques, traditions, methods of inquiry,and modes of production, so that they emerge with the intellectual breadth and acuity to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing worldthat demands agility and innovation. Through both programming and outreach activities, we aim to engage a wider public audience in adialogue about the role of architecture in society.To serve this mission we are committed to the following principal objectives:Recruiting, enrolling, and retaining the most qualified students.Recruiting, employing, and retaining the most qualified faculty and staff.Creating and sustaining a supportive academic environment marked by academic integrity, cultural diversity, and socialresponsibility.Providing the best professional education possible by offering professional degree programs that combine expertise specific to the84discipline of architecture with critical thinking skills and intellectual knowledge central to humanistic study.Teaching an integrated curriculum within which courses in design and other specializations support the proposition, exploration,and development of architectural ideas.Maintaining and enhancing our expertise and capabilities in significant areas of research and practice.Providing opportunities for students to participate in international study programs to better understand the global forces andlocal cultural contexts that contribute to the production of architecture and urban design in these settings.Offering visiting critic studios both on and off campus that provide students with an exposure to alternative perspectives andadvanced building practices.Demonstrating overall competency through a self-directed process of research, documentation, proposition, and projectdevelopment within the capstone experience of thesis.Increasing student awareness of and ability to engage with major issues such as social equity, economic development, andecological balance.Encouraging faculty and students to participate in interdisciplinary initiatives offered within a diverse and rich campus setting.Preparing graduates to enter the profession in a variety of ways, with strong basic design skills coupled with the technical ability,business acumen and an understanding of the ethical role of the architect in society.Supporting faculty achievement in creative activity and scholarly research.Generating advocacy and support for School initiatives from alumni, faculty, staff, and advisory board members, and among civicand business leaders.Syracuse Architecture Studio Culture PolicyThe primary goals of the School of Architecture at Syracuse University are to promote research into architecture and to educate studentsfor professional practice and other forms of architectural engagement. Faculty instructors challenge students to develop the capacity forunderstanding the built environment and generating architectural design proposals as a critical response. They assist students in cultivatingmanifold design capabilities linked to critical intelligence about the discipline and supported by state-of-the-field expertise inrepresentation, technology, structures, theory and history.A central component of this mission is the cultivation of a learning environment that supports students in the fullest development oftheir capacities as designers, scholars, professionals, and citizens. To this end, students, faculty and staff are dedicated to the task ofworking together to foster five fundamental values:mutual respect among all members of the School;optimism about the potential for student learning, creativity and contribution;collaboration among students, faculty, staff and the broader public in pursuing advances in learning, knowledge, and practice;critical engagement with the discipline, the profession and the world; andcontinual innovation in teaching, learning, and research.These values inform all of our activities. In the context of classrooms, studios, and other learning environments, they translate into theseguidelines:The School encourages students and faculty alike to embrace the design studio and the classroom as places of intellectual and85creative exploration and collaboration. The frequently open-ended pursuit of knowledge through design and other forms oflearning requires generosity of spirit on all parts, including the recognition that faculty members bring a high level of expertise totheir teaching and that students bring a diversity of valuable prior knowledge to their learning. It also requires clearcommunication, rigorous testing of ideas, and a commitment to excellence on the part of all participants.The School encourages collaboration among students in their academic work and in extracurricular activities, as well as amongstudents, faculty and staff in continually advancing knowledge and improving the ways we work together. It also promotes aculture of engagement in which students develop intellectually, technically and ethically through interaction with problems,opportunities and people not only within the field of architecture but also beyond it.The School values social, intellectual and disciplinary diversity in its staff, faculty and student population, as well as in itscurriculum. In its teaching, research and daily activities, it strives to support and promote each of these kinds of diversity.The School recognizes that balance is a crucial element in the pursuit of excellence, and it encourages faculty to guide students indeveloping the capacity to reconcile what often seem to be competing imperatives in their work and in their lives. This includesmanaging expectations so as to minimize conflicts among courses, helping students to manage their time effectively, andpromoting an appropriate balance between academic work and the other essentials of life.The School expects students to uphold the principles of academic integrity in their work and ethical conduct in their daily lives.Honesty, trustworthiness and fairness are essential attributes for conduct in class, within the university community, and inacademic activities beyond Syracuse. These principles should guide behavior not only in the completion of course assignments,but also in treatment of buildings and equipment; interaction with university staff, systems and procedures; and behavior in thestudio and elsewhere.Accreditation The School of Architecture B.Arch and M.Arch I programs are fully-accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board(NAAB).In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite forlicensure. The National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professionaldegree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and theDoctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a six-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent ofits conformance with established educational standards. Master’s degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, which, when earnedsequentially, comprise an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as anaccredited degree. For further information about NAAB accreditation, visit the NAAB website.Undergraduate Education Chair         Timothy Stenson, 201 Slocum HallContact     School of Architecture, (315) 443-8242The Syracuse University School of Architecture offers one of the most distinguished undergraduate programs in the nation leading to aprofessional bachelor of architecture degree. Founded in 1873, the school provides a comprehensive and intellectually challengingapproach to the design of the built environment. It is a course of study that recognizes the mix of art and technology, and responds to thechanging demands of the profession and society.The design studio sequence is at the core of the five-year undergraduate program and is unique to architectural education. It is here thatstudents begin to understand the fundamentals of design, working alongside their classmates. Instruction takes place at the desk through86extensive one-on-one communication with dedicated professors, and in formal and more casual reviews of work. In addition to studio andclass work the school hosts a renowned lecture series, as well as symposia and exhibitions by leading architects, critics, and scholars, manyof whom also participate in studio reviews held throughout the semester.Our faculty members are recognized for their level of commitment to each student’s progress and represent a broad range of theprofession, from practicing architects, architectural historians, and theorists to professional artists and engineers.Upper-level students have the option of study in New York City and abroad through programs in Florence, Italy; and London, England.They also have the opportunity to select a visiting critic studio led by notable architects from across the nation and abroad. These designstudios explore advanced architectural issues, computer applications, and fabrication techniques.Prospective students may apply to the school for fall admission. All applicants must submit a portfolio of creative work.

Undergraduate students typically study away in the spring semester of theirthird year and/or the fall semester of their fourth year of the B.Arch program.  Virtually 100% of students study away for a singlesemester, but opportunity exists to enroll for two consecutive semesters as well - 50% of our students choose to study away for a full year.Our programs are also open to non-SU students who study architecture and are currently enrolled in an accredited architecture program.Special scholarship opportunities exist to aid students in taking advantage of study away programs.FlorenceAs part of the Florence Architecture Program, established in 1980, students engage the traditional European city and gain an internationalperspective on design and theory. Annual symposia attract European architects and international critics who are in the forefront of theprofession, and there are extensive field trips to sites of architectural significance such as Venice, Milan, Rome, Lucca, Bologna, and Pisa.The Florence Center includes five separate structures that house classrooms, lecture halls, a library, computer clusters, language center,and gardens. The recently renovated architectural studios are housed in 19th-century artist studios on Piazza Donatello, just a 15-minutewalk from the historic center of Florence.LondonThe London program is based at the Syracuse University London Center in central London, near Covent Garden and the British Museum.The program is structured around a design studio and includes history courses and a field studies seminar exploring the historic andcontemporary architecture of London, with excursions to other cities in the UK. Students may also select from the wide range of non-professional courses available to satisfy elective requirements. The program is staffed by London-based faculty and includes guest lecturersand visiting critics drawn from the extensive London architecture community.New York City87The University's new Fisher Center is based at 136 Madison Avenue in Midtown Manhattan. The New York City program offersopportunity to study in one of the most architecturally rich and culturally vibrant cities in the world. The curriculum focuses on the city'shistory, urban morphology, planning, real estate development, as well as urban theory. The program draws on Syracuse Architecturefaculty and NYC-based critics, combined with guest lecturers, collateral programming, and extensive field studies in and around the city.Short-term/summer global programsIn addition to the regular semester offerings, summer and other 2-5 week study away opportunities, including summer studies abroad, areeasy and attractive options that play an integral part of the undergraduate curriculum.  Previous programs have taken students to India,France, Turkey, Greece, Germany, Russia, Spain, Austria, China, South America and Japan.QuestionsFor further information about our global campus programs and how to apply, contact the Syracuse Architecture Associate Dean’s office at(315) 443-3324 or visit our website.Facilities, Research, Institutes Slocum HallSlocum Hall, the School of Architecture’s campus home, offers an ideal environment for teaching, research, production, and exhibition.Constructed in 1918 and listed on the National Register of Historical Places, the five-story building underwent a dramatic redesign from2006-2008 to enhance and restore original qualities while updating it technologically, functionally, and aesthetically.

The majorsavailable under the standard arts and sciences program, including dual and combined degree programs, are described under individual headings under AcademicOfferings and also on the College's website.  See below for rules governing the selection of a program.DECLARING A MAJORBefore or during the second semester of the sophomore year, each student in the standard arts and sciences program selects a major in consultation withtheir academic advisor. The student applies to the department or committee administering major studies in that field for admission to the major.The Declaration of Major Form is used for this purpose and is available online through Casadvising.syr.edu on the Academic Forms page. To declare a majorofficially, a student secures the signature of the appropriate department or committee chair on this form and returns the form to the Advising andAcademic Support office, Room 323, Hall of Languages. Students who fail to submit a completed  Declaration of Major Form to the college Advising andAcademic Support office before earning 54 total credits will be declared ineligible to register for subsequent semesters.At various times, students are asked to state on other routine forms, including the admissions application, what their major will be. Such declarations areinformal expressions of interest and intent and are not binding, either on the part of the student or the department (or committee). Completion of suchroutine forms does not secure admission to any major program. Only use of the Declaration of Major Form, with the signature of the chair, can accomplishthat end.CHANGING MAJORSStudents may change a major at any time before registration for the last full semester of study by submitting a new Declaration of Major Form with theapproval of the new major department or committee.DOUBLE MAJORSStudents may wish to declare, to fulfill the requirements for, and to graduate with two or more majors. To do so, they should indicate both majors and obtainthe appropriate department signatures on the  Declaration of Major Form.   The second major may be added no later than the registration period for thelast full semester of study.Special Degree Options and CombinationsDouble MajorsTwo majors may be pursued simultaneously in the College of Arts and Sciences or in the college and another school or college at the University. Studentsmust fulfill all the requirements for both majors as well as all other degree requirements of The College. A single degree is conferred by the college. The twomajors appear on the transcript. Of the 300-level and higher coursework offered toward the satisfaction of the requirements of the two majors, a maximum103of six credits may overlap. Students singly enrolled in the college who have a second major in another school or college must still earn the minimum of 96credits in the College of Arts and Sciences.Please note: Arts and Sciences students may not declare the double major in any of the following areas: English education; science education; mathematicseducation; social studies education; advertising; broadcast journalism; graphic arts; magazine; newswriting; photography; public relations; television, radio,and film. Liberal Arts CoreThe Liberal Arts Core requirements are a set of principles that flexibly guide students to select courses and serve to define the common structural core of aliberal arts education at Syracuse. They were devised and adopted by the faculty of the college. They assure that each student’s course of study includes themost important features of an education in the liberal arts. There are three fundamental parts to the Liberal Arts Core requirements:  I. Liberal Skills; II.Divisional Perspective; and III. Critical Reflections.I. LIBERAL SKILLSThe Liberal Skills Requirement asks each student to further develop fundamental intellectual skills of effective writing and gives the student a choice ofwhether to satisfy a requirement in second language skills or quantitative skills.Writing Skills (3 courses)Students are required to complete the following:The first of these courses is chosen from Writing Studio 1: Practices of Academic Writing ("

The minor in Leadership/Stewardship Communication is designed to enhance the student’s understanding of the relationship betweencommunication and leadership and to develop appropriate skills for enhancing leadership. The minor complements many of the University’s professionaland liberal arts programs, especially those that prepare students for leadership roles in specific professions (law, politics, management, media, communityservices, and so on).Admission Requirements• 3.0 GPA (based on completion of 30 credits)• Must enter program no later than first semester of junior year• Complete petition and submit to department chair for approval• Petitions accepted at any time, but normally reviewed and approved after October 15 (fall semester) and March 1 (spring semester) deadlines forapplications.Curricular RequirementsStudents must complete the following six courses for a total of 18 credits: Writing Studio 2 3Area specialization/academic 1-3Total credits: 15-17Sophomore Year, Fall SemesterWeekly Student Convocation 0Composition 2Performance 1720 Writing Studio 2 3724 Writing Studio 2 319Sophomore Year, Fall Semester Writing Studio 2 3Academic elective 318Junior Year, Fall Semester Writing Studio 2 3Area Specialization/Academic 1-3Total Credits: 15-17Sophomore Year, Fall SemesterWeekly Student Convocation 0Principal Performance Area 2Secondary Performance Area 1 Writing Studio 2 318Junior Year, Fall Semester Writing Studio II 3Total Credits: 17Sophomore Year, Fall Semester741Academic Elective 3 Writing Studio 2 315-18Junior Year, Fall Semester Writing Studio II 3Secondary Performance Area 1 Writing Studio 2 3Academic Elective 318Sophomore Year, Fall Semester Writing Studio 2 3Area Specialization/Academic 1-3Total Credits: 15-17Sophomore Year, Fall SemesterWeekly Student Convocation 0Principal Performance Area 2Secondary Performance Area 1 Writing Studio 2 318Please note that the sequence of courses has changed in the first year.

DIVISIONAL PERSPECTIVE1. A student must take four 3- or 4-credit courses in each of the three curricular divisions of the College of Arts and Sciences: the Humanities, the NaturalSciences and Mathematics, and the Social Sciences divisions.2. In each division, two of the courses must constitute an approved sequence.3. Of the twelve courses used to satisfy the divisional requirement, no more than three courses may be taken from a single department or program (even ifthe courses of the department or program are in more than one division), with the exception of 3-credit HNR courses offered by the Renée CrownUniversity Program.  Any course cross listed is considered to belong to each of the departments in the cross listing.  Therefore it counts as one of themaximum of three allowed from a single department to fulfill the divisional distributional requirement. Experience Credit and Independent Study creditcannot be used to satisfy the Divisional Perspective Requirement.4. In each division, no more than one course may be selected from schools and colleges outside the College of Arts and Sciences.5. In the Natural Sciences and Mathematics Division, at least one laboratory course must be included.III. COURSES FOR THE CRITICAL REFLECTIONS REQUIREMENTStudents are required to take two courses from the list provided on the College of Arts and Sciences web site. These courses may be simultaneously used topartially satisfy other liberal arts core requirements or requirements for majors and minors.Transfer credit is not accepted for Critical Reflections requirements except when defined in articulation agreements.Writing Intensive RequirementStudents will take a Writing-Intensive course as a prerequisite to taking .Graduation with a Bachelors of Arts degree in international relations requires an overall grade point average of 2.0 or higher in 24 credits of upper-divisioncourses for the major, including a grade of ‘C’ or better for work undertaken to fulfill the senior capstone requirement.ADDITIONAL PROGRAM OPPORTUNITIESInternational relations majors are expected to study abroad during their undergraduate program. Syracuse University Abroad (SU Abroad) offers a richvariety of courses that can be applied to the International Relations major requirements. Please see http://suabroad.syr.edu.Participation in the Maxwell-in-Washington International Relations Semester, a 15-credit seminar and internship program, is recommended for all majors.For more information on this program, please contact the International Relations Programs office and see our webpageat http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/IR_Maxwell_in_DC/Co-curricular activities, such as the International Relations Learning Community, a residential program for students new to Syracuse University, as well asour International Relations Honor Society Sigma Iota Rho, Model United Nations Club and Team, International Relations Club, Conversations in IRspeakers series, colloquia, and related activities, are available.  Please see our webpage for more information. http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/ir/The International Relations Program also offers minors in Global Political Economy and Global Security Studies.  For more information, please see our“Affiliated Minors” webpage under “Academics” at http://www.maxwell.syr.edu/IR_affiliated_minors/International Relations Secondary Teacher Preparation ProgramCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in International Relations and Secondary (Social Studies) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for Social Studies (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (not190necessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Divisional Perspective RequirementTHE HUMANITIES DIVISIONThe Humanities Division encompasses the history, theory, analysis and criticism of language, literature and other texts, religion, art, and music; and theexamination of fundamental questions arising in the human search for values, knowledge, purpose, and meaning. These are central concerns of thedepartments or programs of African American Studies; English; Languages, Literatures and Linguistics; Art and Music Histories; Philosophy; Religion andWomen's Studies. Hence, most courses satisfying the Humanities Division requirements come from these departments and programs.THE HUMANITIES LISTStudents must take at least four courses from the following list, including a two-course sequence (indicated by hyphens), to complete the requirement forfour courses in this division. No more than three courses may be taken from a single department or program (even if the courses of the department orprogram are in more than one division).AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDI Modern American Politics Through FictionHST/  Modern American Politics Through FictionNote: Transfer and other credit are not accepted for the Critical Reflections Requirement except when defined in articulation agreements.Special Degree OfferingsFor additional information on the following options, contact:  Advising and Academic Support122Office:323 Hall of LanguagesCall: 315-443-3150E-mail: casadvising@syr.eduOptions for Study in the College of Arts and Sciences.  There are two general options for study leading to the B.A. or B.S. degree for undergraduates in the College of Arts and Sciences: the Standard Program andthe Selected Studies Program.The Standard Program involves the Liberal Arts Core, a major, electives and, perhaps, a minor or an additional major. The first two years are devotedlargely to work that satisfies requirements of the Liberal Arts Core. The major is chosen by the end of the second year.The selected studies program offers the student an opportunity to develop a highly individualized curricular plan. This program, which can lead to the B.A.or the B.S. degree, is intended to meet individual needs. It provides considerable freedom in curricular planning, but also requires greatly increasedresponsibility on the part of the student.  Each student in the selected studies program develops a four-year program of study based on academic goals. He orshe is assisted by a faculty advisor who helps to formulate an academically sound curriculum. For additional information please see Selected Studies underUndergraduate Program Offerings.Combined ProgramsThe College of Arts and Sciences offers combined programs of study with certain professional schools and colleges within the University. These programslead to two degrees and require at least 30 credits beyond the minimal requirement for one degree and a total of at least 150 credits. This means that itgenerally takes five years (10 semesters) to complete a combined program. Specific requirements vary from program to program and are described underindividual program headings. Students pursuing a combined program in the College of Arts and Sciences must complete all college requirements relevant tothe chosen program of study. A minimum of 96 credits in the College of Arts and Sciences is required. For a general definition and requirements of acombined program and comparison with other kinds of programs, refer to the appropriate chart in the “Academic Rules and Regulations” section of thiscatalog.A combined program in the College of Arts and Sciences is offered with the College of Engineering and Computer Science and results in the B.A. or B.S. inArts and Sciences and the B.S. in Engineering.Dual EnrollmentsThe College of Arts and Sciences offers dual enrollments in cooperation with certain professional schools and colleges within the University. These lead toa single degree jointly authorized and certified by the cooperating schools. The standards and procedures for admission vary and are described underindividual headings. With careful course selection and planning, students are able to finish within four years (eight semesters) and within the 120-126 creditsrequired for a degree. (For a general definition and requirements of a dual program and comparison with other kinds of programs, refer to the appropriatechart in the “Academic Rules and Regulations” section of this catalog.)Dual enrollments in Arts and Sciences are offered only with the School of Education and the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.For the Dual program offered with S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications:Contact Rosanna Grassi, Associate Dean, S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, 315 Newhouse 3, 315-443-1908 orFor the College of Arts and Sciences, contact Advising and Academic Support, 323 Hall of Languages, 315-443-3150, casadvising@syr.eduStudents in the College of Arts and Sciences who are dually enrolled in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications receive the bachelor’s degreejointly awarded by both colleges.Students complete the requirements for the B.A. degree or the B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Sciences, including at least 90 credits in Arts andSciences coursework and an Arts and Sciences major, or a selected studies program approved by the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Students alsosatisfy requirements for a major in the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, chosen from the professional fields of advertising; broadcast anddigital journalism; graphic design; magazine; newspaper and online journalism; photography; public relations; or television, radio, and film. At least 122credits, including electives, are required to graduate.Students who wish to enroll in this program should request dual enrollment at the time of admission to the University, or they may consult the School ofPublic Communications about an intra-University transfer to the dual program during the first or sophomore year.First-year students entering the dual programStudents entering the Arts and Sciences/Public Communications Dual Degree in their first year will be required to satisfy the core requirements for the dualdegree by completing the requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences Liberal Arts Core.Students entering the dual program after the first year and who are either singly enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences or the S.I. Newhouse School ofPublic Communicationssatisfy the core requirements for the dual degree by completing the requirements of the school or college in which they were originally singly enrolled. Ineither case, the College of Arts and Sciences is the home college.Other Special OptionsArts and Sciences/Art123The special options degree program in arts and sciences/art is designed for students who wish to include studio arts in conjunction with studies in humanitiesand/or sciences. The option permits any major in the College of Arts and Sciences to be joined with studio arts work. The degree awarded at the completionof undergraduate study is a B.A. in the arts and sciences major with the supplementary designation “and art.” The degree is singly awarded by the College ofArts and Sciences.Arts and Sciences/MusicThis special options degree program provides the opportunity to combine any degree in the College of Arts and Sciences with advanced studies in musicperformance or music composition–studies that will be taken primarily in the Setnor School of Music. To be admitted to the special options degreeprogram, students in the College of Arts and Sciences apply through the Department of Art and Music Histories before the beginning of the sophomoreyear. Prospective students for the music performance and music composition degree options must meet admissions requirements administered by the SetnorSchool of Music.The degree awarded after completing undergraduate studies is a B.A. in the arts and sciences major with the supplementary designation, “with advancedstudies in music performance/composition” (depending on the particular degree option). The degree is singly awarded by the College of Arts and Sciences.Completion of the major does not result in any professional or artistic certification by the Setnor School of Music or the College of Visual and PerformingArts.  Combined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees - Secondary Teacher Preparation Programs  School of Education contact: Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall. mrsarno@syr.eduThis combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for a New YorkTeaching certification for grades 7-12 in English, mathematics, a science area, or social studies. It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education dual programs in these areas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree ineducation after completion of a general Arts and Sciences degree.The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History(TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to graduate school. Each admission stage requires a 3.0 cumulative GPA and a 3.0 GPAin the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate education courses.The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theEducation contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Mateo, Alick McLean, Jonathan Nelson, Gary M.Radke, Romita Ray, Sascha ScottThe Department of Art and Music Histories was one of the first in the country dedicated to the study of the history of art and music from aninterdisciplinary perspective. The department offers courses in most major periods of the history of visual and musical arts from ancient to postmoderntimes. The research and teaching specialties of the department’s faculty include 19th-and 20th-century music, the history of opera, ethnomusicology, artand medicine in the early modern period, Italian Renaissance art, 17th-century Dutch painting, Asian Art, 19th- and 20th-century European art, andAmerican and Latin American art. In view of the Department of Art and Music Histories interdisciplinary approach, courses examine the histories of artand music within the cultural, sociopolitical, economic, and religious contexts of the societies that created them.136Studies in the history of architecture are offered in association with the faculty of the School of Architecture (see program description under “History ofArchitecture” in this section of the catalog). Cooperative programs with the College of Visual and Performing Arts, the S.I. Newhouse School of PublicCommunications, and other divisions of the University allow for the inclusion of courses in studio art, music theory, performance and composition, andpublic communications.Students who major in one of the department’s disciplines are strongly encouraged to take a foreign language and to study abroad.Major Requirements:The major in art history requires 30 credits in art history courses numbered above 299.  Students in this specialized major may also include 6 credits of artstudio work at any level in the required 30 credits. Students may petition to have up to 9 credits of appropriate courses in art history taken outside thedepartment (non-HOA courses) count toward the art history major.Additional requirements for the art history major follow:Distribution RequirementCourse offerings in art history are divided into five broad categories: ancient/medieval; Northern/Italian Renaissance; Baroque/18th-century European;modern/American; and non-Western. Art-history majors are required to take at least one course in each of these five categories.500-level Course RequirementArt history majors are required to take at least one course at the 500 level or above. 500-level or above courses are customarily open to advancedundergraduate majors as well as graduate students in the M.A. program in art history.   Such courses offer more detailed study of particular fields within arthistory than those numbered at the 300 and 400 levels.Senior Seminar RequirementDuring the fall semester of their senior year, art history majors are required to successfully complete a senior seminar. This seminar explores the practicalaspects of the discipline, paying particular attention to potential careers and professional research and writing.

Tetley, Pramod K. Varshney, SenemVelipasalar, Hong Wang, Heng Yin, Edmund YuThe Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE) program at Syracuse was originally established in 1969 through the former Department ofElectrical Engineering and was the second such program of its kind in the nation.  This program has been accredited by the Accreditation Board forEngineering and Technology (ABET) since 1973.  Currently the BSCE program is housed in the Department of Electrical Engineering and ComputerScience (EECS) which is a department in the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS).Computer Engineering (CE) at Syracuse University has two primary foci:  Computer Hardware Design: including an understanding of design methodologiesfor electronic circuits, digital systems, computer architecture and integrated circuits, and Computer Software Design: including an understanding of designmethodologies for algorithms and data structures, operating systems, and a wide variety of software applications across various computer languages. Inaddition to design methodologies, test and verification principles are studied, as well as performance estimation and the underlying computation theory. There is an excellent opportunity in laboratories to put the theory and design methods into practice by using digital components, design simulators, andmicrocontrollers.Part of the department's mission is to enable CE graduates to use computer engineering and other knowledge to solve relevant societal problems as describedby the BSCE Educational Objectives. This is accomplished by a rigorous curriculum that prepares students to achieve the BSCE Educational Outcomes priorto graduation and the BSCE Educational Objectives after graduation.EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES FOR THE BSCE PROGRAMThe educational objective of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCE) program in the Department of Electrical Engineering and ComputerScience (EECS) at Syracuse University is to prepare well-rounded graduates that are ready for work and ready for change. Well-rounded graduates of the BSCE program are known by their professional competence, innovative thinking, willingness to further enhancetheir education, ability to work individually and in diverse teams, leadership abilities, communication skills, and integrity.466Graduates of the BSCE program who are ready for work are engaged in applying the knowledge acquired in Computer Engineering, combined withtheir problem solving abilities, to produce feasible solutions to problems, in a timely manner, which are deemed important in industry, government,or academia.Graduates of the BSCE program who are ready for change exhibit the intellectual flexibility necessary to solve new problems in innovative ways byintegrating multiple viewpoints from several disciplines in search of the best possible solutions or applying their knowledge to differentprofessional disciplines. STUDENT OUTCOMES FOR THE BSCE PROGRAMIn addition to successfully completing the requirements for the BSCE program which are described further on in this handbook, graduates from this programmust also achieve the following educational outcomes prior to graduation:BSCE STUDENT OUTCOMES(a)  an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering(b)  an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data(c)  an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social,political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability(d)  an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams(e)  an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems(f)  an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility(g)  an ability to communicate effectively(h)  the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context(i)  a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning(j)  a knowledge of contemporary issues(k)  an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice.(l)  an ability to verify design correctness and evaluate performance of computing systems.BSCE REQUIREMENTSProgram ComponentsThe BSCE program has four fundamental educational components: mathematics and sciences, engineering, social sciences and humanities, and generaleducation.  A liberal number of courses have been set-aside as electives in order to allow students, with the guidance of their advisors, to customize theireducation according to their personal and career objectives.  A summary of required and elective credits within each component is as follows:Math and Science Education : 33 required, 0 elective; for a total of 33 credits;Engineering Education: 48 required, 18 elective; for a total of 66 credits;General Education: 12 required, 9 elective; for a total of 21 credits;Social Science and Humanities Education: 3 required, 6 elective; for a total of 9 credits.Total Credits 130A Typical Program of Study Presented by SemesterFirst Year, Fall Semester  Earth System Science (4)"

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in these areas,and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.

The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan. : Introduction to Biological AnthropologyC. One of the following courses:  Introduction to Biological Anthropology Introduction to BiologicalAnthropology 3 YBiological anthropology subfields;anthropology's relationship to history ofscience. Evolutionary theory; mechanisms ofevolution; survey of the non-human primates;humans ancestral to modern Homo sapiens;and modern human variation. Required forAnthropology majors., 331, 431, 432, and 433.  These glossaries are given in The College of Arts andSciences section of the Undergraduate Catalog.Non-Engineering/Computer Science ElectivesThe purpose of this 9-credit requirement of non-engineering/computer science elective courses is to provide students with a broad educational experience ina diversity of subjects. Out of the 9 credits, at least 3 credits have to be from the College or Arts and Sciences. Moreover, technical courses offered by (orcross-listed with) the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS), courses with pass/fail grades, CPS courses,  and 100-level courses in CHE, MAT,and PHY cannot be used to satisfy this requirement.  IST courses will require permissions from academic advisors.MinorsThe Computer Engineering curriculum is flexible enough to allow a student to complete minors without taking additional credits or by taking only a fewextra courses.  Today’s computer engineers work in an environment where they are expected to know not only computer hardware and software, but alsomaterial from a collection of other subject areas-from device technology or computer science to management and how computers affect the world.  Thecomputer engineering curriculum responds to this need by providing students with a strong basis in the fundamentals of computer engineering coupled withadditional courses drawn from mathematics, electrical engineering and computer science.  With the core courses in MAT and ELE, BSCE students normallyare no more than 9 credits away from completing a minor in Electrical Engineering (ELE) or Mathematics (MAT).Graduation Requirementsstudents must complete their program of study satisfying all the course requirements described in Sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4;students cannot graduate with courses having missing grades or incompletes;students must have earned an average GPA of at least 2.0 (C)  in all the engineering, mathematics and science courses. In addition, the overall GPAof all courses taken at Syracuse University must be at least 2.0 (C);469Monitoring Student’s ProgressAdvising: Each student is assigned an academic advisor.  A list of advisors can be found at the board outside Room 130 in Link Hall.Helpful AdviceIf you designate a minor in your program of study and you decide not to pursue it any longer, you must drop it before graduation.  Otherwise, you will not beable to be certified for graduation because you have not fulfilled the requirements for this minor.Computer Engineering MinorMinor Coordinator - C.Y. Roger Chen, 4-133 Center for Science and Technology, 315-443-4179, crchen@syr.eduThe minor in Computer Engineering requires a minimum of 18 credit hours, 12 of which must be in 300 to 400-level coursework.

Students interested in transferring are required toattend an Information Session and meet with an advisor in the Whitman School’s Office of Undergraduate Programs.  Students must complete the necessarypaperwork no later than the last day of classes of the sophomore year.MINORS AVAILABLE TO MANAGEMENT STUDENTSStudents in the Whitman School are encouraged to pursue a minor offered by other schools or colleges, and should seek assistance from their academicadvisor in choosing a minor that will enhance their academic program. With careful and early planning, many minors can fit into the undergraduatecurriculum without a need for extra coursework. While management students are allowed to pursue most minors offered outside the Whitman School,provided that they have the appropriate prerequisites, they most often choose a minor in economics, global enterprise technology, informationmanagement and technology, political science, psychology, public communication studies, or a foreign language.MINORS IN MANAGEMENTMinor Coordinator: Rachel DuBois215 Whiman School of Management315-443-2361The Whitman School offers several minors, allowing students to pursue either general management studies or a more specialized program that provides in-depth study in one area of management. A minor in management can help students learn about subjects that contribute to success in business, not-for-profit,and government organizations. Knowledge in management is seen as beneficial by many prospective employers.The minors in Whitman are available to matriculated undergraduate students from all Syracuse University schools and colleges other than the WhitmanSchool, provided that they have the permission of their home school or college, a cumulative grade-point average (GPA) of at least 3.0, and a minimum offour semesters to complete the requirements.  A student may declare a minor in: Accounting, Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises, Finance, GeneralManagement Studies, International Business, Marketing, Real Estate, Retail Management, and Strategic Management. The details of each of the minorprograms can be found under Academic Offerings.There are two deadlines for submitting applications for management minors: November 1 and April 1 of each academic year. Due to course sequencing andenrollment limitations, students must have a minimum four semesters to complete the minor requirements. Any student wishing to apply for a managementminor after the spring of the sophomore year must have one or more courses completed or in progress (please see an advisor in the WhitmanUndergraduate Office for more information).TO DECLARE A MINOR IN MANAGEMENT1. Check with your home school or college office to make sure you have room in your program for the required courses. Also check that you have acumulative GPA of at least 3.0.2. Pick up a minor declaration form in SOM Suite 215 (keep in mind the April 1 and November 1 deadlines).3. Bring the minor declaration form to SOM Suite 215 before the deadline. If you are approved, you will be notified via e-mail and asked to pick upthe form.4. Take the signed form to your home school or college office. They will approve the declaration and give you instructions about how to get theminor officially posted on your SU record.TRANSFERRING COURSES INTO MINORS IN MANAGEMENTNormally, a maximum of one course (3 credits) taken at another institution can be used toward the 18 credits of coursework required for the minor. In someminors, there may be no courses considered transferable from other institutions.  Upper-elective minor courses must be taken through Syracuse Universityand are not eligible for transfer credit.  Students wishing to transfer a course into the minor must receive approval in advance from the WhitmanUndergraduate Office.FacilitiesThe Whitman School of Management’s 160,000-square-foot sustainable building opened in 2005, with a central focus on students and creating anenvironment that promotes a culture of collegiality and a high-tech, world-class learning experience.

WHITMAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT* Perspectives on DisabilitiesHealth and Exercise Science  Perspectives on Disabilities (3 credits)English And Textual Studies Secondary Teacher PreparationCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in English and Textual Studies and Secondary (English) Teacher Preparation ProgramContact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall, mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for English Language Arts (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program inthese areas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a generalArts and Sciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  394The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History(TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.   The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan. : Perspectives on Disabilities (3 credits)CFE/ Perspectives on Disabilities (3 credits), and  Perspectives on Disabilities (3 credits), and : Perspectives on Disabilities (3 credits)CFE/WSP: 444 Schooling & Diversity (3 credits) or EDU: 310 American SchoolTechnology                                      (Choose 3 Credits) Perspectives on Disabilities 3 SOverview of learner characteristics and servicedelivery models for students with disabilities;selected issues in child protection; problemsolving processes for inclusive schools andcommunities.

In addition to liberal arts courses, students are expected to complete 15 credits of Program Requirements and 18-24credits in a specialty track (decided on in the second semester of the sophomore year). Each track prepares students to work in specific settings: Early Child Development students focus on child care and pre-school settings in the early intervention field.Youth and Family Development students learn to work in a variety of settings that focus on youth and family needs including social services,health, mental health and juvenile justice programs, counseling centers, parenting programs, recreation and athletic programs, afterschoolprograms and schools. Early Childhood Education (4+1) prepares students for careers as early childhood educators. Students have the opportunity to pursue a master’sdegree in early childhood special education (ECSE) on year after completing an undergraduate degree in CFS. Students enrolled in this degreeprogram will receive a 30 percent reduction for their one year of graduate tuition. Child Life Specialist prepares students to help children and their families overcome life's most challenging events.

Students from different colleges typically work on projects with broader applications than usuallyfound in academic courses.Undergraduate Research ProgramKandice L. Salomone, Director323 Hall of Languages, 315-443-1643The Undergraduate Research Program (URP), housed in the College of Arts and Sciences but open to qualified participants from other colleges, exists toprovide non-classroom, credit-bearing educational opportunities to undergraduate students. Interested qualified students work closely with Arts and Sciencesfaculty members in faculty-generated research projects, other projects representing the faculty member’s academic interests, learning environmentsprovided by professionals affiliated with the College of Arts and Sciences, or eligible off-campus internships with an identified Arts and Sciences advisor.The program features the apprenticeship model, and students gain firsthand experience in creative and investigative academic processes, translate theory125into practice, explore the cutting edges of particular disciplines, develop closer working relationships with faculty members, and enhance their own careerand educational credentials.FACULTY PARTICIPATIONThe program offers Arts and Sciences faculty members a chance to extend and expand the character of their teaching in the undergraduate context, to workclosely with self-selecting, highly motivated students, to attract excellent students to continued study in their particular field of study, and to open bothinternal and external funding possibilities by way of undergraduate involvement in their work. Faculty member are invited to propose projects to theDirector. Individual projects may extend beyond a semester in length as appropriate. The character and requirements of these projects, as well as thenumber of credits involved, vary greatly, since they come from across the disciplines of the College of Arts and Sciences, and sometimes from othercolleges as well. The common criterion for all, however, is appropriateness to an educational credit-bearing experience for qualified undergraduate students.Syracuse University AbroadMargaret Himley, Associate Provost for International Education and Engagement106 Walnut Place, 315-443-9416Syracuse University Abroad (SU Abroad) offers undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to study, research, and intern abroad.

Students understand advocacy as a practice that includes public argument and reasoning in multiple contexts aswell as how each context demands its own set of unique actions. In this way, the minor offers intellectual and practical tools.  The minor is designed to be of interest to those wishing to learn about the emergence of key public issues; the larger political, social, and economicframework out of which they emerge; and how different constituencies respond. You learn to assess competing interests within a public issue as well asengage in local, regional, and national advocacy campaigns. By the completion of the minor, you come to understand advocacy as a necessary part ofcitizenship. Admissions requirementsThe minor is open to all undergraduate SU students with a minimum GPA of 3.0.Curricular requirementsAdvocacy and Public Rhetoric Courses(9 credits):Choose either , the first education course, must be taken no later than spring of the junioryear.Anthropology MajorDepartment Chair: John Burdick209 Maxwell Hall315-443-2200Faculty Douglas V.

Wadley Anthropology explores the entire range of human experiences in the past and present. Our department offers undergraduate courses covering the breadthof the discipline, including  physical anthropology  (the study of human evolution and biological variation);  archaeology  (the study of prehistoric andhistoric cultures through material remains); linguistics  (the study of language - its structure, historic developments, and social aspects);  culturalanthropology  (the study of contemporary societies); and  applied anthropology  (the use of anthropological methods and theory to solve real-worldproblems). Ongoing research by our faculty and graduate students covers a broad array of topics, from slave settlements in Jamaica to women anddevelopment in India; from religious movements in Brazil to sustainable agriculture in Nepal; from forestry in Kenya to the Underground Railroad inSyracuse. Current research sites span the globe, including South and East Asia, South and North America, West and East Africa, the Middle East, Europe,and the Caribbean.Undergraduate training in anthropology is useful in many fields, including education, international business, law, journalism, cultural resources managementand public service.  For students interested in future graduate studies in anthropology, our program offers a solid ground in theory, methods, ethics andpractical application.Undergraduate students are encouraged to explore anthropology not only through course work, but with direct involvement in laboratory research and fieldwork. Our department has fully equipped archaeology and physical anthropology laboratories, providing a variety of research opportunities. A well-established archaeological field training program is offered each summer. Field experience in cultural anthropology is available through communityinternships, independent studies, and ongoing faculty research. We also recommend that students consider spending a semester or two in another countrythrough the University's SU Abroad Program, as a way of enhancing their major with true cross-cultural experience.

YingerEconomists analyze the internal functioning of markets and market outcomes. While modern economics focuses on market forces, markets functionimperfectly in some cases and that introduces scope for policy action. Our curriculum emphasizes the application of economics to the study of public policyissues and the role of government in a market economy. Examples include analysis of international trade and relations, economic behavior in theworkplace, health care, taxation, and numerous other spheres of a global economy. Students who major in economics prepare themselves for a variety ofcareers. Some move on to graduate study in economics and become professional economists; the majority, however, pursue careers in law, public policy,government, and many aspects of business, including banking and financial analysis, management, and marketing. Consequently, some students choose topursue double majors and dual degrees. Further information on these programs is available in the Academic Rules and Regulations section of this catalog orin the economics department office.The department offers both the B.A. degree in economics as well as a B.S. degree in economics. The B.A. has a liberal arts focus and emphasizes the appliedand policy aspects of economics. The B.S. is attractive to the more mathematically oriented student.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSB.A. DegreeA student becomes an economics major after consulting with an economics advisor on a plan and course of study and bringing them to the departmentoffice for approval.

Of these languages, six are spoken by the Haudenosaunee Confederacy:Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora. These languages share a common grammatical structure and cultural history. This certificateprogram will explore the commonalities and differences among the Iroquois languages.The courses are designed for students and teachers of Iroquois languages, addressing many different needs. They provide an excellent foundation for Iroquoislanguage students, teachers, linguists, anthropologists, and others. These courses will contribute to Iroquois language revitalization efforts and expandknowledge of the Iroquois languages.The Certificate in Iroquois Linguistics provides a unique opportunity to study the linguistic principles and grammatical features that are unique to theIroquois languages. This program also offers a unique opportunity to study Iroquois linguistics with rich examples from the six Haudenosaunee (Six NationsIroquois Confederacy) languages.Iroquois linguistics entails the study of a number of interacting grammatical systems within the Iroquois languages. The Certificate Iroquois Languages (CIL)sequence of courses will study all of the grammatical systems within the Iroquois Languages. The student will study the grammatical systems that theIroquois languages have in common as well as the parts of the grammatical system which makes each of the Iroquois languages distinct.The Iroquois verb is especially complex. It is imperative that someone who is learning or teaching an Iroquois language has a complete understanding of thegrammatical systems that are interacting within the verb; to achieve fluency in an Iroquois language requires a full understanding of the grammaticalsystems. The Native Speakers of the Iroquois Languages acquire the grammatical systems naturally. In Iroquois Linguistics one seeks to model theirknowledge.A student in the Certificate in Iroquois Linguistics will also explore and learn to use the vast scholarly resources which are available to those who learn thelinguistic terminology and concepts that are employed within these resources.COURSE REQUIREMENTS:Fall: (4 cr.)

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram.

Students in thismajor, which leads to a B.A. degree, also learn about Russian literature, art, folklore, film, media, and business, and, hence, about the people and culture aswell. Through courses in other departments, students may also investigate the history, philosophy, and political science of Russia.Students are admitted to the major through departmental approval and should consult the Russian language coordinator about their majors as early aspossible. Early consultation is particularly important for students with little or no preparation in Russian so they may be sure to satisfy prerequisites andrequirements within four years.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSTo major in Russian, students complete the following requirements for either Option I or Option II. Option I The program requires 25 credits in RUScourses, 4 of which may be in lower-division courses.Option II The program requires 28 credits, 16 of which are in RUS courses. (Of the 16 RUS credits, 4 may be in lower-division courses; the rest are inupper-division courses.) The remaining 12 credits (6 of which are in upper-division courses) will be in relevant courses approved by the Russian faculty,taught in English in various departments.

Rubinstein, Maureen Trudelle Schwarz, Theresa A. Singleton, John Marshall Townsend, Cecilia Van Hollen, SusanS. Wadley Anthropology explores the entire range of human experiences in the past and present. Our department offers undergraduate courses covering the breadth ofthe discipline, including  physical anthropology  (the study of human evolution and biological variation);  archaeology  (the study of prehistoric and historiccultures through material remains); linguistics  (the study of language - its structure, historic developments, and social aspects);  cultural anthropology  (thestudy of contemporary societies); and  applied anthropology  (the use of anthropological methods and theory to solve real-world problems). Ongoingresearch by our faculty and graduate students covers a broad array of topics, from slave settlements in Jamaica to women and development in India; fromreligious movements in Brazil to sustainable agriculture in Nepal; from forestry in Kenya to the Underground Railroad in Syracuse. Current research sitesspan the globe, including South and East Asia, South and North America, West and East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Caribbean.132Undergraduate training in anthropology is useful in many fields, including education, international business, law, journalism, cultural resources managementand public service.  For students interested in future graduate studies in anthropology, our program offers a solid ground in theory, methods, ethics andpractical application.Undergraduate students are encouraged to explore anthropology not only through course work, but with direct involvement in laboratory research and fieldwork. Our department has fully equipped archaeology and physical anthropology laboratories, providing a variety of research opportunities. A well-established archaeological field training program is offered each summer. Field experience in cultural anthropology is available through communityinternships, independent studies, and ongoing faculty research. We also recommend that students consider spending a semester or two in another countrythrough the University's SU Abroad Program, as a way of enhancing their major with true cross-cultural experience. For information contact theAnthropology Department Undergraduate Director.The minor in anthropology is designed to encourage students to pursue breadth in areas which complement their major. With the assistance of their facultyadvisors, students can design a minor reflecting their interest in any of the subfields of anthropology: socio/cultural, biological/physical, archaeological,applied, and policy-related studies.To complete the minor in anthropology, students take 18 credits. No more than 6 credits at the 100-200 level can count toward the minor.Examples of possible courses leading to a minor in anthropology could include (but are in no way limited to) the following:Applied and Policy Related: "

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual programs in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title Mathematics. The second admissionstage involves an application to graduate school. Each admission stage requires a 3.0 cumulative GPA and a 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to betaught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate education courses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theEducation contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Advanced students work in hand papermaking and bookmaking aswell. A broad drawing curriculum is considered essential to printmaking. In addition, the student is encouraged to take advantage of other disciplines andresources in the school and the University.The B.F.A. degree program in printmaking, requiring 126 credits, promotes an open, experimental attitude within the rigors of high professional andtechnical standards. Students are urged to explore the various technical printmaking processes and their aesthetic qualities before narrowing their interests toa specific technique. As their studies progress, students may pursue a more thorough investigation of a particular process. Students may, however, decide tocontinue working within a broad scope of printmaking throughout their college careers, taking advantage of the overlapping aesthetic and technicalpossibilities existing in the range of printmaking processes.Regular critiques of student work provide an active exchange of ideas on aesthetic and media interests. Faculty members can help students identify and worktoward their educational and career goals while they complete the requirements of the program.MAJOR REQUIREMENTS First Year, Fall SemesterART101 First-Year Colloquium 1Art or design history 3FND Studio 3FND Studio 3738 Analysis of 20th-Century Music 3Large Ensemble 1Small Ensemble/Coaching 1Academic Elective 3Area Specialization/Music Elective(S) 3-5Total Credits: 15-17Senior Year, Fall SemesterWeekly Student Convocation 0Principal Performance Area 4500-Level Elective In Music History and Literature 3Large Ensemble 1Small Ensemble/Coaching 1Academic Elective 3Area Specialization/Music Elective(S) 3-5Total Credits: 15-17Senior Year, Spring SemesterWeekly Student Convocation 0Principal Performance Area 4MHL Elective 3Large Ensemble 1Small Ensemble/Coaching 1Academic Elective 3Area Specialization/Music Elective(S) 3-5Total Credits: 15-17Total Minimum Credits: 126 Theater Design & TechnologyContact:  Department of Drama, 820 East Genesee Street, 315-443-2669Faculty Felix Cochren, Alex Koziara, Maria Marrero:The Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater Design and Technology is conducted within a stimulating environment that combines both classroom and hands-onlearning experiences.

Thomas Starmer, Melody Troeger Sweet, Joseph T. Tupper, Roy Welch, Jason R. WilesStudents majoring in biology establish a general background in the discipline through a series of first-year/sophomore-level core courses that preview themajor sub-disciplines of biology. This introductory program is followed by courses that allow the student to focus on more advanced material.The major in biology leads to either the B.A. or the B.S. degree. The B.S. degree is intended for students interested in graduate study in biological science orthe health professions (medicine, dentistry, or veterinary medicine). In addition to biology requirements, students pursuing the B.S. degree in biology takegeneral and organic chemistry, and mathematics through calculus. Students are also encouraged to gain practical experience and academic credit through theUniversity Honors Program, the Community Internship Program, or departmental research.Students may also receive a B.S. in biology with emphasis on environmental sciences.The B.A. degree is intended for students who wish to pursue technical or science-related careers that do not require a graduate or professional degree, orcareers outside of biology in which a background in science may be useful, such as science writing, business, or law. Although the first-year/sophomore-levelcore biology course requirements for the B.A. and the B.S. degrees are similar, there are key differences for the B.A. in the first-year courses required andfewer additional courses in chemistry and mathematics are required relative to the B.S.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSB.S. Degree Requirements (57 to 59 credits)Departmental Requirements (38 credits) Students in the B.S. program complete the first-year/sophomore core curriculum (16 credits) plus an additional 22credits of upper division coursework in Biology with a minimum of 6 of the 22 credits being laboratory credits.

Burman, Randal Elder, J. Michael Haynie, G. Thomas Lumpkin, Alexander McKelvie, Minet Schindehutte, Clint B. Tankersley, WilliamJ. Walsh, Johan WiklundThe major theme of the Martin J. Whitman School of Management is entrepreneurial management. Entrepreneurial management is defined as the ability toenvision and create new business ventures whether in a startup situation or within a mature organization; the ability to identify new opportunities; and theability to grow and renew existing businesses (including nonprofit organizations) in a healthy, productive manner. Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurialmanagers must deal with numerous challenges and opportunities including managing proficiently in rapidly growing global markets. These excitingchallenges require new ways of thinking, creating, and managing. They also require personal courage and risk-taking.The Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises Program (EEE) is designed to link educational excellence and entrepreneurial ingenuity. Topics covered inthe curriculum include the entrepreneurial mind, opportunity identification and verification, financing, venture planning, managing family and closely heldenterprises, venture capital, startup challenges, legal issues facing entrepreneurs, creating an entrepreneurial culture, and building highly proficiententrepreneurial teams. Students frequently benefit from the expertise of local and national leaders in the field.Graduates of the EEE program are particularly well-suited for the growing opportunities found in both small and large organizations requiringentrepreneurial skills. A primary educational mission of the EEE program is to help students recognize and capitalize on their own entrepreneurialpotential.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSStudents majoring in entrepreneurship and emerging enterprises must take the following courses (credits in parentheses):Sophomore or Junior Year  Introduction to Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprises (3)Junior and Senior YearMajor electives (9)Management electives (6)Major electives are chosen from the following:  Introduction to EntrepreneurshipTwo 300-level or higher FIN electives for which student has taken prerequisites.*     *   Introduction to Entrepreneurship Introduction to EntrepreneurshipFor information on declaring a Whitman minor, click here.Marketing Minor  Introduction to Entrepreneurship  Introduction to Entrepreneurship   Introduction to Entrepreneurship  Introduction to EntrepreneurshipOne 300- or 400-level SHR or LPP course for which the student has taken prerequisites, or  Introduction toEntrepreneurship and EmergingEnterprises 3 SCourse focuses on what it takes to start, grow,and sustain new ventures.

Policy Studies Secondary Teacher Preparation ProgramCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in Policy Studies and Secondary (Social Studies) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 138 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for Social Studies (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Totah, Jon ZubietaChemistry, the science concerned with the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of matter, especially of atomic, elemental, and molecularsystems, is taught through courses in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry and through direct participation in original research.Undergraduate majors in chemistry may elect one of three programs, two leading to a B.A. degree, with an emphasis in either chemistry or biologicalchemistry, and one to the B.S. degree. Either B.A. degree program requires fewer credits in chemistry than the B.S. option, and yet provides a foundation inthe discipline adequate for either immediate professional engagements or for graduate studies. Students studying for a B.S. degree in chemistry gain a moreextensive background as they fulfill a broader range of requirements; they must file a petition with the department chair indicating their intent to secure theB.S. degree before it can be awarded.Students interested in a B.S. degree in biochemistry should see the biochemistry section of this catalog.For information about certification to teach chemistry at the secondary school level, see Education/Arts and Sciences (dual program) in this section of thecatalog.B.A. DEGREE REQUIREMENTS(Chemistry Track)Requirements include 36 credits in chemistry core courses, 32 of which are taken in specific courses.

As a result, they musthave a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field ofstudy. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence abouta painting’s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.Integrated Learning Majors provide broad, interdisciplinary opportunities for students through valuable tools and knowledge in a variety of fields. Thissynergistic approach adds scholarly mettle to both the major and the interdisciplinary program, while exploiting their connective properties. For example,an undergraduate interested in chemistry could have an integrated learning program in forensic science. Or a student pursuing archeology could have anintegrated learning major in ethics, with focus on social science research.Required: GPA of at least 2.0; and complete all the requirements of one of the following majors: Anthropology, Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, EarthSciences, Physics, Psychology, and Sociology.

Andersen, Stuart I. Bretschneider, William D. Coplin, Carol Faulkner, Paul M. Hagenloh, Mary E. Lovely, Amy Lutz, Don Mitchell, GrantD. Reeher, Junko Takeda, Peter J. WilcoxenThe Maxwell Program in Citizenship and Civic Engagement is an individually customized interdisciplinary plan of study for students who wish to connectthe disciplinary focus of one of the traditional Maxwell/College of Arts and Sciences undergraduate degrees in the social sciences with the Maxwell traditionof dedication to persistent, committed involvement in the local, national, and international communities in which we live.The program entails two majors: 1) one major chosen from the existing social-science disciplines within Maxwell (Anthropology, Economics, Geography,History, International Relations, Political Science, Policy Studies, and Sociology) or a related discipline outside of Maxwell that entails a substantial social-science focus; and 2) the Citizenship and Civic Engagement major, constructed by the student and his or her faculty advisors in a manner that brings thedisciplinary tools gained in pursuit of the social-sciences major to bear on questions of citizenship, civic engagement, and public affairs. The program thusintegrates for its students two of the great strengths of the Maxwell School—excellence in the social sciences and a dedication to the public good—andprovides pathways for producing direct, meaningful connections between knowledge and action.The Program begins with a sequence of lower- and upper-division courses, which coordinates the experiences of students in the various disciplinary majorsand directs them towards the defining requirement of the major: the senior-level Action Plan Workshop, in which students design and implement, as muchas possible, a concrete strategy for addressing an issue of local, national, or international concern. The Action Plan will rely on the training received in thestudent’s social-science discipline, but it will not be a traditional academic thesis; rather, the goal will be to study, understand, and act on an issue deemedimportant by the student herself. The Program requires thirty-one credit hours of coursework, in addition to the requirements for the separate social-science or other majors; some of these courses will fulfill other Arts and Sciences and departmental requirements at the same time.Program Requirements:The Program requires thirty-one credit hours of coursework, outlined below, in addition to the completion of a concurrent major chosen from the existingsocial-science disciplines within Maxwell (Anthropology, Economics, Geography, History, International Relations, Political Science, Policy Studies, andSociology) or a related discipline outside of Maxwell that entails a substantial social-science focus.152The program has two entry points: the beginning of a student’s first year at Syracuse University, and the beginning of the second.The first-year entry point allows prospective high-school seniors to apply to the Program at the same time they apply to Syracuse University; thoseaccepted will enter the Program upon matriculation. They will also benefit from a robust schedule of social and academic events that are designed to build asense of esprit de corps among the cohort.Students already at Syracuse University may apply for admission to the program at the end of the first year, for matriculation at the beginning of thesecond. The Program Board will recruit students from the intro-level courses in Maxwell departments and related departments across campus, as well asfrom * Democratization in East Asia (Hong Kong)PSC/IRP/GEO/* Democratization in East Asia (Hong Kong)Global Governance and Foreign Policy* Democratization in East Asia (Hong Kong)PSC/IRP/GEO/ Democratization in East Asia 3 YOffered only in Hong Kong.

History Secondary Teacher PreparationCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in History and Secondary (Social Studies) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for Social Studies (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  187Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Courses are selectedwith the help of the student’s faculty advisor and approved by the Program’s Advisory Board. The courses must come from at least two different academicdepartments or units within Maxwell; one of the courses may be taken from any unit in the University. These courses should be selected to provide a broadsubstantive background for a student’s Action Plan; students will be encouraged to integrate into their studies civically engaged research from outside theMaxwell School.Concurrent MajorThe structure of the Maxwell Program in Citizenship and Civic Engagement is based on the premise that the senior-level Action Plan will require and applythe research skills gained in pursuit of an undergraduate degree in the social sciences.All students, therefore, must complete, in addition to the requirements for the Maxwell Program in Citizenship and Civic Engagement outlined above, aconcurrent major chosen from the existing social-science disciplines within Maxwell (Anthropology, Economics, Geography, History, InternationalRelations, Political Science, Policy Studies, and Sociology) or a related discipline outside of Maxwell that entails a substantial social-science focus.Students singly enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences choose the concurrent major from the existing social-science disciplines within Maxwell, orfrom suitably related disciplines in the College of Arts and Sciences.Students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences dual programs with S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications or the School of Education, orstudents enrolled in other schools/colleges in majors not directly related to the social sciences, may apply for a dual or double major, respectively, inCitizenship and Civic Engagement if their intended course of study and goals for academically informed civic engagement fit with the structure andcapacities of the Program. In such cases, the Program’s Director and Board will ensure that the student’s program of study provides sufficient background inthe social sciences to complete the Action Plan.Classical Civilization MajorContact: Jeffrey S. Carnes, jscarnes@syr.edu332 H.B. Crouse, 315-443-2068 Faculty Jeffrey S. Carnes, Matthieu H. van der MeerWhy Study Classics? The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there.                                                                                                L.P. HartleyStudents approaching Classical Studies for the first time may wonder how the study of languages and cultures from antiquity is relevant in the digital era;why study Classics? First, Classics provides students with many fascinating intellectual opportunities.  Because the range of Greek and Latin literature is so diverse, studentsinterested in history, drama, poetry, political science, or philosophy, will find ample material to stimulate their curiosity. Moreover, students will developthe ability to read some of the most influential works of western literature in their original languages, and learn about cultures that are radically differentfrom our own, yet at the same time provide the foundation of many modern ideas and institutions.Since Classical Studies have traditionally played a central role in education they have left an indelible mark on the intellectual, political, and artisticdevelopment of Western Civilization.  Countless authors, as diverse in time and place as Dante and Derek Walcott, have looked for inspiration to theclassical tradition; political theorists and statesmen, including Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, developed their political ideals through a closereading of ancient historians such as Polybius and Thucydides.  Understanding the reception of classical texts and the ways subsequent generations adaptedand modified classical ideals will grant students a greater degree of proficiency in civic and cultural history, and help them better understand the culturalpolitics of their own world. While not all Classics students wish to become classical scholars, a major in Classics is among the most impressive degrees to have when applying for a jobin other fields.  The work ethic required for success in the languages, the intellectually challenging nature of the grammar and syntax of Greek and Latin,and the interdisciplinary nature of the field are only a few reasons why Classics majors are highly respected and sought-after job candidates.  Furthermore,because of the historical role of Classics in education many terms and concepts in various fields are derived from Greek or Latin.  For these reasons, Classicsmajors often find employment in Law, Medical Sciences, Government/Politics, Writing and Journalism, and Education.  Why study Classics?  To find a challenging and immensely rewarding field of study, and to explore the familiar yet foreign country that is our past.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSThe Major in Classical Civilization requires 27 credits chosen from the following list of courses.  No more than 9 credits may be selected from any onesubject, and no more than 18 credits may be selected from any one department. At least 18 credits must come from courses numbered 300 and above; inaddition, at least two courses must come from the courses taught within the Classics program (those with the prefixes LAT, GRE, and LIT).  Other coursesrelated to the ancient world may be substituted with the approval of the program director.154GRE"

HartleyStudents approaching Classical Studies for the first time may wonder how the study of languages and cultures from antiquity is relevant in the digital era;why study Classics?First, Classics provides students with many fascinating intellectual opportunities.  Because the range of Greek and Latin literature is so diverse, studentsinterested in history, drama, poetry, political science, or philosophy, will find ample material to stimulate their curiosity. Moreover, students will developthe ability to read some of the most influential works of western literature in their original languages, and learn about cultures that are radically differentfrom our own, yet at the same time provide the foundation of many modern ideas and institutions.Since Classical Studies have traditionally played a central role in education they have left an indelible mark on the intellectual, political, and artisticdevelopment of Western Civilization.  Countless authors, as diverse in time and place as Dante and Derek Walcott, have looked for inspiration to theclassical tradition; political theorists and statesmen, including Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, developed their political ideals through a closereading of ancient historians such as Polybius and Thucydides.  Understanding the reception of classical texts and the ways subsequent generations adaptedand modified classical ideals will grant students a greater degree of proficiency in civic and cultural history, and help them better understand the culturalpolitics of their own world.While not all Classics students wish to become classical scholars, a major in Classics is among the most impressive degrees to have when applying for a jobin other fields.  The work ethic required for success in the languages, the intellectually challenging nature of the grammar and syntax of Greek and Latin,and the interdisciplinary nature of the field are only a few reasons why Classics majors are highly respected and sought-after job candidates.  Furthermore,because of the historical role of Classics in education many terms and concepts in various fields are derived from Greek or Latin.  For these reasons, Classicsmajors often find employment in Law, Medical Sciences, Government/Politics, Writing and Journalism, and Education. Why study Classics?  To find a challenging and immensely rewarding field of study, and to explore the familiar yet foreign country that is our past.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSGreek EmphasisThe Major in Classics with Greek Emphasis consists of 27 credits in Greek, with at least 18 credits coming from courses numbered 300 and above.

WilkinsonThe Earth Sciences provide insights into some of humanity’s deepest questions. How was the planet Earth, our lifeboat in space, formed? What are theprocesses that have shaped the Earth — its surface and internal structure? How has life, of which humanity is a part, evolved? Why are there earthquakes,volcanoes, mountain chains, continents, and oceans? How has the surface of the Earth changed through time? On a practical level, the study of EarthSciences provides a basis for understanding natural hazards, assessing Earth’s climate variability and global change, predicting the migration of man-madepollutants, and exploring for the energy and mineral resources upon which society depends. The study of Earth Sciences also, uniquely, provides aperspective of time and an appreciation of the natural world that can enrich a lifetime.The Department of Earth Sciences offers bachelor of science and bachelor of arts degrees. The bachelor of science degree is recommended for studentsintending to pursue a career in the Earth Sciences–either professionally or in academia. Most bachelor of science students continue on to graduate school toobtain a master’s degree, the standard entry-level professional degree in the Earth sciences, or a Ph.D. if they intend to pursue a career in academia. Twobachelor of science degree tracks are offered within the department, the B.S. in Earth Sciences, and the B.S. in Earth Sciences with focus in environmentalscience. The B.S. in Earth Sciences provides a strong background in basic science and geology, and through appropriate choice of electives can be tailored tomeet a wide range of possible interests within the Earth Sciences. The B.S. in Earth Sciences with focus in environmental science is offered jointly with thebiology department, and is recommended for those students specifically intending to pursue a career in the environmental arena.The bachelor of arts degree in Earth Sciences is recommended for those students who enjoy and are intellectually intrigued by the Earth Sciences, but intendto pursue careers in other fields. The B.A. degree differs from the B.S. degree in that it requires fewer ancillary science courses and fewer electives fromwithin the department. Along with intellectual enrichment, the B.A. degree provides a rounded science foundation and critical thinking skills that can beapplied to numerous other fields. Graduates with B.A.s in Earth Sciences go on to be lawyers, teachers, business people, environmental planners, publicpolicy makers, and politicians, as well as geologists.REQUIREMENTS FOR A B.A. DEGREE IN EARTH SCIENCESIntroductory Course (one of the following): Aural Rehabilitation 3 YDouble Numbered with: "

All else being satisfied, Distinction is conferred following a vote of approval from the Faculty of the Department of Earth Sciences.Earth Sciences MinorDonald Siegel, Chair204 Heroy Geology Laboratory315-443-2672The Earth Sciences provide insights into some of humanity’s deepest questions. How was the planet Earth, our lifeboat in space, formed? What are theprocesses that have shaped the Earth — its surface and internal structure? How has life, of which humanity is a part, evolved? Why are there earthquakes,volcanoes, mountain chains, continents, and oceans? How has the surface of the Earth changed through time? On a practical level, the study of EarthSciences provides a basis for understanding natural hazards, assessing Earth’s climate variability, predicting the migration of man-made pollutants, andexploring for the energy and mineral resources upon which society depends. The study of earth sciences also, uniquely, provides a perspective of time andan appreciation of the natural world that can enrich a lifetime.MINOR IN EARTH SCIENCESTo complete a minor in Earth Sciences, students must take 18 credits in Earth sciences which includes an introductory course (EAR105 or EAR110 orEAR203), and 12 credits of courses numbered 300 or above. Earth Science Secondary Teacher Preparation ProgramCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in Earth Science and Secondary Science Education (Earth Science) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New York164State teaching certification for Earth Science (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

While modern economics focuses on market forces, markets functionimperfectly in some cases and that introduces scope for policy action. Our curriculum emphasizes the application of economics to the study of public policyissues and the role of government in a market economy. Examples include analysis of international trade and relations, economic behavior in theworkplace, health care, taxation, and numerous other spheres of a global economy. Students who major in economics prepare themselves for a variety ofcareers. Some move on to graduate study in economics and become professional economists; the majority, however, pursue careers in law, public policy,government, and many aspects of business, including banking and financial analysis, management, and marketing. Consequently, some students choose topursue double majors and dual degrees. Further information on these programs is available in the Academic Rules and Regulations section of this catalog orin the economics department office.MINOR IN ECONOMICSTo pursue a minor in economics, a student must petition the Economics Department and complete the following requirements:1. 3-6 credits of Principles of Economics ("

These courses are counted as generalelectives and not as economics or arts and sciences electives.B.S. DegreeThe B.S. degree has an orientation toward the statistical and mathematical skills necessary to work as a professional economist or pursue graduate work ineconomics, public policy, or business. Students who want these career tracks or who want to acquire more analytical skills that can be used in a variety ofcareers should pursue the B.S. degree.A student becomes an economics major after consulting with an economics advisor on a plan and course of study and bringing them to the departmentoffice for approval.

Through a range of interdisciplinarycourse offerings, it seeks to foster environmental literacy and citizenship among students. Those completing the minor will gain a deep understanding of thepolitical, cultural, and economic factors that affect our use of the environment. Courses in the minor draw primarily from the social sciences andhumanities and ask a variety of questions. Who determines how the environment is used? How has the way we value nature and wildlife changed over time?How do social divisions influence who is affected by climate change, pollution, or natural disasters? How can we create a more sustainable society?The Environment and Society minor is an excellent accompaniment to majors in other fields. For those interested in the natural sciences, the minor offersperspectives on the social dimensions of nature less emphasized in science courses. For those interested in public policy and economics, it allows students todelve more deeply into environmental matters. For those interested in business, finance, or management, the minor offers an opportunity to learn moreabout the relationships between environment, economy, and society. Finally, for those seeking a future in the media, it enables students to learn more aboutthe environmental issues they will report on during their career. In short, the E&S minor is a program for those who care about nature and want to findsolutions to environmental problems. It is also a way for students to document their knowledge and expertise in environmental issues for the growingnumber of ‘green’ jobs and industries.MINOR REQUIREMENTSThe program leading to a minor in Environment and Society requires the completion of six courses (18 credits), two of which are mandatory and four ofwhich are electives. Of the four elective courses for the minor, two must be in departments outside Geography. Students should work closely with theirmajor advisor and the E&S minor coordinator to ensure they are meeting the necessary requirements for both programs.Minors must take the following TWO lower-division courses: Presentational Speaking (3 credits)Exercise Science MinorContact: Melissa Tobin, 209 Ernie Davis Hall, 315-443-9800; mmtobin@syr.edu .Students pursuing major degrees in other program areas may enroll in a minor in exercise science.

As a result, they musthave a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field ofstudy. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence abouta painting’s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.The major in Ethics will integrate with the following majors: management, television/radio/film, broadcast/newspaper journalism, engineering, computerscience, biology, biomedical and chemical engineering, political science, public health, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and international relations, butother combinations requisite majors may also be possible with approval of the director.This synergistic approach adds scholarly mettle to both the major and the interdisciplinary program, while exploiting their connective properties. First- andsecond-year courses contemplating the Integrated Learning Program in Ethics are advised to take one of the following courses:  Selected Topics 1-3 SExploration of a topic (to be determined) notcovered by the standard curriculum but ofinterest to faculty and students in a particularsemester.

Recent advances in basic scientific research have had a rapid and dramatic impact inthese fields and it is only through an understanding of these fundamental scientific concepts that the legal system may be effective in criminalinvestigations. A minor in forensic science offers a strong complement for students interested in criminal justice to major areas of study such asanthropology, biology, chemistry, physics, geology, psychology, engineering, pre-medicine, sociology, and pre-professional degree programs.

At SyracuseUniversity, geographers study globalization, environmental change and history, mapping and spatial techniques, immigration, urban and cultural politics,social movements, and surface processes of the physical environment. As a major, geography gives you a range of skills AND a new perspective on theworld. Because geographers research issues such as sustainable development, gender equity, and environmental change, geography provides tools not only tounderstand the world but also to change it!Geography is easy to pair with another major, such as international relations or biology, or a degree from another college, such as the Newhouse School ofPublic Communications or Smith College of Engineering and Computer Science. After graduation, geography majors do very well. Students find jobs inemergency management, federal and state environmental agencies, GIS and cartography, urban planning, non-profit organizations, community andinternational development, teaching and research, journalism, real-estate analysis, environmental consulting, and other fields. The Geography Departmentalso offers research opportunities for undergraduates. Our majors work with community groups to address concerns like hunger, youth resources, and publictransportation. They complete exciting senior theses on topics from political change in East Africa to water management in Central America. Finally,majors can take advantage of internships or study-abroad opportunities to obtain course credits while gaining valuable work and international experience.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSThe program leading to a B.A. in geography requires at least 33 credits in geography, 21 of which must be at the upper division (i.e. 300-level or above).Majors must take the following THREE lower-division courses: or higher.

To do so, students must meet minimum GPArequirements, carry out original research under the supervision of a geography professor, and write a Senior Thesis based on that research. This honorrecognizes a student’s achievement of academic excellence and is acknowledged on the diploma.Geography MinorRobert Wilson, Director of Undergraduate Studies533 Eggers Hall315-443-9433Geographers are concerned with social, spatial, and environmental processes in human and natural systems. Their work focuses on critical theory, practicalapplication, analysis, and interventions. Of central importance to the study of geography are relations between diverse social groups, as well as betweenpeople and their natural and human-built environments. Coursework for a Geography minor spans the social and natural sciences, and includes cartography,geographic information systems (GIS) and other technologies for analyzing spatial information. Many geography students combine majors and minors inother fields to prepare themselves for careers in environmental analysis and resource management, urban and regional development, international relations,conflict resolution, public service, and more.MINOR IN GEOGRAPHYTo complete a minor in geography, students must complete 18 credits in geography courses, of which a minimum of 12 credits must be upper division (i.e.300-level or above). Geography Secondary Teacher PreparationCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in Geography and Secondary (Social Studies) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu   This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for Social Studies (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in these183areas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.

As a result, they musthave a comprehensive understanding of not only their own field, but also secondary knowledge of another broadly based, often interdisciplinary, field ofstudy. A chemist might lend his or her expertise to a matter of legal or ethical importance. A curator might evaluate scientific and historical evidence abouta painting’s authenticity. A journalist might research a story involving science, medicine, and technology.Integrated Learning Majors provide broad, interdisciplinary opportunities for students through valuable tools and knowledge in a variety of fields. Thissynergistic approach adds scholarly mettle to both the major and the interdisciplinary program, while exploiting their connective properties. For example,an undergraduate interested in chemistry could have an integrated learning program in forensic science. Or a student pursuing archeology could have anintegrated learning major in ethics, with focus on social science research.Majors in the integrated learning major in Neuroscience will integrate with: Biochemistry, Biology, Communication Sciences & Disorders (CSD),Linguistics, Philosophy, Physics and Psychology) and two majors in Engineering and Computer Sciences (Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering).Requirements: An overall GPA of at least 2.0; a GPA of no lower than 3.0 in the 24 credit hours counting towards the Neuroscience  IL Major, a grade nolower than “B-” in the two required entry level courses (; Double Numberedwith:  Museums and Native Americans3 IRCrosslisted with: ; Double Numberedwith:  Museums and Native Americans3 IRCrosslisted with: "

Moreover, the rapidly advancing knowledge in the biomedical fieldsdepends on biophysical concepts and methods, notably electrophysiology, pharmacological kinetics, and biomolecular structure determination. Accordingly,there is need for health care professionals and life scientists with ample training in the physical as well as biological sciences.The following interdisciplinary option under the B.S. in physics is designed for students who are adept at the mathematical problem solving and conceptualaspects of physics, and who are interested in careers in biology, biological physics, medical physics, or medicine. Students with demonstrated proficiency inboth physical and biological sciences will have special advantages not only for admission to and performance in graduate and professional schools, but alsofor their subsequent careers. More specifically, such training would be particularly relevant for the following fields of medicine: cardiology, neurology,ophthalmology, and radiology.The following course sequence and variations meet the general prerequisites for medical school admission established by the Association of AmericanMedical Colleges and also apply for careers in most of the other health professions.

What must I do? Because thestudy of philosophy so effectively sharpens and extends the mind, many students find it to be the ideal companion to other courses of study.The philosophy curriculum has two principal divisions. The first division consists of studies that are central to philosophy proper. There are four coreareas: ethics, logic, metaphysics and the theory of knowledge, and the history of philosophy. The second division includes courses devoted to thephilosophical examination of other areas of inquiry and culture, such as mathematics, the natural and social sciences, language, politics and the law, the arts,history, education, and religion.Students particularly interested in political philosophy should see the program description under that heading in this section of the catalog.Students particularly interested in logic should see the description of the logic concentration, included under “Interdisciplinary Minors” in this section of the216catalog.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSStudents seeking a BA in philosophy are required to complete at least 33 credit hours in philosophy, at least 24 credits of which are numbered 300 or above.In order for a course to count towards a student’s major program, the student must receive a grade of C or better in the course.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  392Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Courses in political science enable students to usepolitical theory and empirical analyses to make sense of their world, to interpret political phenomena in the United States and in other areas of the world,and to understand world politics. Skills in research, analysis, and critical thinking that political science students acquire help to prepare them for careers inpolitics and government, journalism and communication, and business, as well as post-graduate study.Note: Students are required to fulfill the requirements for the B.A. or minor in political science as stipulated in the course catalog for the academic year inwhich they declare their political science major or minor. Graduation with a B.A. or a minor in political science requires a 2.0 average in the upper-divisioncoursework applied toward the major or minor.MINOR REQUIREMENTSThe minor in political science requires 18 credits of coursework.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

Waghorne, Ernest E. Wallwork,James W. Watts236Knowledge of religion is critical in today’s world. The academic study of religion at Syracuse University offers students the opportunity to explore religionin a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary context. Students who take courses in religion learn to interpret the dynamics of religious convictions, actions, andexpressions.Religious traditions and practices engage such questions as: What kind of life is most worth living? How do we understand the nature of the world? How dowe relate to ourselves and to others?Students study religious life and thought from the perspectives of arts, ethics, gender, history, literature, mythology, philosophy, political theory,psychology, scriptural studies, social sciences, and theology.The academic study of religion is a critical undertaking and an often transforming experience introducing students to unfamiliar aspects of their own world,and to the religious realities of our global situation.The Department of Religion has articulated three goals that shape its teaching and its expectations of what students in its courses and programs may expectto gain from this study:1. to understand better the nature and diversity of religious expressions in the contemporary world and in history, and their power in peoples’personal and collective lives;2. to think more deeply and critically about religious experience and its modes of expression and forms of interpretation;3. to recognize and appreciate the difficulties and possibilities in a disciplined study of religion; and to become aware of a diversity of approaches andmethods within that study.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSThe major requires 30 credits of appropriate work, approved in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Because of the interdisciplinarycharacter of religion courses, it is crucial that the following clusters (in depth and breadth/diversity) be delineated and approved in consultation with theDirector of Undergraduate Studies, in keeping with the following conditions:1. at least four courses that ensure depth by clustering around one of the following:1. a particular tradition (e.g., Buddhism, Judaism)2. a particular geographical area or historical period (e.g., America, South Asia)3. a particular thematic (e.g., philosophy, popular culture)2. at least three courses that ensure breadth and/or diversity of study, as decided in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.3.

Religion MinorChair: James W. Watts501 Hall of Languages315-443-3861 Knowledge of religion is critical in today’s world. The academic study of religion at Syracuse University offers students the opportunity to explore religionin a cross-cultural and interdisciplinary context. Students who take courses in religion learn to interpret the dynamics of religious convictions, actions, andexpressions.Religious traditions and practices engage such questions as: What kind of life is most worth living? How do we understand the nature of the world? How dowe relate to ourselves and to others?Students study religious life and thought from the perspectives of arts, ethics, gender, history, literature, mythology, philosophy, political theory,psychology, scriptural studies, social sciences, and theology.The academic study of religion is a critical undertaking and an often transforming experience introducing students to unfamiliar aspects of their own world,and to the religious realities of our global situation.The Department of Religion has articulated three goals that shape its teaching and its expectations of what students in its courses and programs may expectto gain from this study:1. to understand better the nature and diversity of religious expressions in the contemporary world and in history, and their power in peoples’ personal andcollective lives;2. to think more deeply and critically about religious experience and its modes of expression and forms of interpretation;3. to recognize and appreciate the difficulties and possibilities in a disciplined study of religion; and to become aware of a diversity of approaches andmethods within that study.RequirementsStudents take 18 credits of appropriate and approved work in keeping with the following conditions:1. at least 12 credits in courses numbered 300 or above;2. all credits will be taken in courses offered by the Department of Religion.Students interested in pursuing a minor in religion should contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies in 501 Hall of Languages, 315-443-3861.

Robinson,Dennis Romano, Maureen Trudelle Schwarz, Laurence Thomas, Margaret Susan Thompson, Robert J. Thompson, Susan S. Wadley, Joanne P. Waghorne,Ernest E. Wallwork, James W. WattsReligion and Society is an interdisciplinary program that provides the opportunity to study the pervasive role of religion in contemporary society,especially in U.S. national politics, international relations, economic development, and popular culture–and in most facets of social change broadlyconceived. Course requirements aim to provide students with (1) an understanding of several major religious traditions on their own terms; (2) perspectiveson the social and cultural roles played by religion in various periods and places, not the least of which is the contemporary world; and (3) comparativeanalyses of religion’s influence on particular aspects of human cultures, such as politics, violence, and group identity. The program is open to any SUstudent, and may be especially useful to students interested in pursuing careers in journalism, international relations, law, government, or foreign service.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSThe B.A. in religion and society is designed to encourage study of the interaction of religion with other aspects of public affairs, such as politics, diplomacy,law, and business, on the basis of a broad understanding of various religious traditions. It consists of a minimum of 30 credits (at least 18 credits in coursesnumbered 300 or above), of which 12 credits must be earned in courses from the Traditions list, 12 from the Religion and Society list, and 6 from either.Traditions Courses (12-18 credits): Religion, Art, and Aesthetics 3IRIntersection between religion, art, andphilosophy.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree. The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with the266School of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

The minor complements many majors because all organizations need people who understand information resources and information technology.Students who minor in information management and technology will increase their employability in a variety of careers. Biology and chemistry majors who want to work in a research lab will be more employable if they can use online information systems toretrieve information and manage data, such as genome sequences.Retailing and business students will be better prepared to work in business if they have skills in microcomputer applications and office systemstechnology.Communications students must be able to research information and present and package it effectively in video, audio, and print form. Aninformation management and technology minor will provide those skills.Economics, history, and political science majors with courses in information systems and information policy will find many opportunities towork in federal, state, and local government.Health and Human Services majors who minor in information management and technology will be better prepared to work in the automated,information-intensive environment of the health care industry.Design and art majors will learn how information technology gives them new tools by which to enhance the world.Admissions:Students considering the minor may delay enrolling until the third year of study. However, interested students are encouraged to begin planning with aSchool of Information Studies advisor during the first or second year. Students are required to fill out a brief application form. Applicants must have a gradepoint average of at least 3.0. Depending upon available spaces, students with GPAs below 3.0 may be considered. However, there may be times when GPArequirements will be higher than 3.0 due to space restrictions.

This portfolio allows students in the Writing major to archiveand demonstrate their expertise within and across multiple genres and rhetorical contexts. Electronic writing portfolios serve as a record of each student’sdevelopment and growth as a writer over their course of study and should not be limited to a specific number of writing products. The student, inconsultation with his or her advisor and informal faculty mentors, is ultimately responsible for deciding what will be included in the electronic portfolio andhow that portfolio will be shaped for specific purposes:  professional, academic, public, and creative or a combination of two or more.  Students may wantto create portfolio “chapters” or segments, which encompass different genres, purposes, and audiences.268 269Asian/Asian American Studies Senior Research Seminar II 2 YWorkshop provides students withcollaborative environment to develop a majorproject over an extended period.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in these areas,and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  390The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.  and  and  and  or 105) (3 credits)• Humanities (Other than arts related) (3 credits)• Social Science: (Other than history or psychology) (3 credits)• Foreign Language: one course (minimum 3 credits) in a language other than English (including American Sign Language), or equivalent competencyestablished by examination or level three of high school study.

Undergraduate EducationDEGREE REQUIREMENTSAll undergraduate programs offered by the School of Education typically require the completion of 120 to 138 credits. Specific program requirements vary,as do the total number of credits.At several points during teacher preparation programs, reviews of students’ progress are made to determine continued eligibility for each program. Thesereview points vary, but in all cases include the time just prior to student teaching. See individual program descriptions for further information.Field experiences, usually off campus, are required throughout most programs, with placement sites assigned by course instructors or through the fieldplacement office. While convenience is considered in making placement assignments, other factors may preclude the most convenient appointments. TheSchool of Education does what it can to facilitate transportation for field experiences before student teaching. Students are encouraged to provide their owntransportation for student-teaching assignments ("

Study AbroadAt Syracuse University, studying abroad is a longstanding tradition.  More than half the students enrolled through the SU Abroad (formerly known as DIPA)come from universities across the U.S. and from almost all major fields of study.The School's programs run in conjunction with SU Abroad and have close ties to local universities, allowing students to design integrated programs of studyappropriate to their academic and linguistic abilities. Every SU Abroad Center is overseen by a faculty director, administrators and host-country staff whoare available to assist students at all times with their academic and personal needs. Pre-departure and on-site orientation programs further prepare studentsfor their semester or year abroad. The School of Education supports and encourages study abroad for undergraduate students enrolled in any of our programs.  The faculty and programadvisors work very closely with students on appropriate course sequencing to facilitate this. FacilitiesThe quality of a student-centered research institution is measured in part by its success in integrating its students’ learning experiences and its facultymembers’ scholarship. In a professional school, the key to that integration lies in sustained, critical, always-respectful engagement with the profession andthose it serves. It relies upon creating a community of learners devoted to service. The efforts of our students and faculty members to create such acommunity are supported by an organizational infrastructure of coordinating councils, teacher centers, professional development schools, subject matteracademies, specially-funded research and development projects, and skilled staff members. All are devoted to nurturing collaborative partnerships betweenpreservice educators, University faculty, and practicing professionals in public education, higher education, and other educational and work environments.The following facilities are part of our campus in Syracuse, New York:Huntington Hall houses the Dean's office and the majority of School of Education departments and offices.The Hoople building houses the faculty offices, clinic and classroom for the Department of Counseling and Human Services. The Center for HumanPolicy is also located in Hoople.Heroy is home to the Department of Science Teaching and houses classroom and laboratory space.Comstock Art Facility, 1055 Comstock Ave is the main building for Art Education.Crouse College houses an auditorium and practice space for Music Education .Carnegie is home to Math Education.111 Waverly Avenue, Suite 230 is home to the Office of Academic and Student Services .The Women's Building  houses the Exercise Science Department's faculty and administrative offices, two research laboratories, two gymnasiums, anindoor pool, a dance studio, outdoor playing fields, and tennis courts.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.   The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describing387Dual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in these areas,and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  416The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.

This innovative program is designed to prepare graduates for careers in classrooms (grades 1-6) that serve an increasingly diverse student population. Inaddition to liberal arts distribution courses and depth in a liberal arts area, students take professional courses that integrate within them material on childrenwith both typical and “special” needs who come from diverse cultural backgrounds. Supervised field experiences take place throughout the program at avariety of Syracuse area settings, and include placements in schools that are at the forefront of inclusive education.PROGRAM REQUIREMENTSProgram requirements include liberal arts skills and distribution courses, a concentration or major of no less than 30 credits in an approved liberal arts andsciences area, and professional coursework. The program typically requires between 133 and 145 credits. The length varies and can be more than 145credits, depending on the student’s skill background, the chosen liberal arts concentration or major, and other choices made by the student. In most cases,students enroll for more than 15 credits in a semester and/or take summer courses (at SU or other colleges) to complete the degree within four years.Therefore, prospective students not already enrolled in the School of Education are encouraged to consult with the School of Education as early as possible.Please note that in choosing courses to meet the Liberal Arts requirements, students must keep their choice of liberal arts concentration or major in mind,including required number of upper division courses, and, whenever possible, choose courses that can also be used toward that concentration or major.Liberal Arts Requirements: Collaborative Teaching for Inclusive Education (3 credits)Also required:  Safe and Healthy Learning Environments (1 credit), or equivalent, which includes the following topics: Identifying/reporting child abuse, violence prevention, child abduction prevention, highway/general safety, alcohol/drug/tobacco406prevention, fire and arson prevention, and training related to the Dignity for All Students (DASA) Act. International Relations Secondary Teacher Preparation ProgramCombined Bachelor’s/Master’s Degrees in International Relations and Secondary (Social Studies) Teacher Preparation Program Contact Marie Sarno, Teaching and Leadership Programs, 173 Huntington Hall mrsarno@syr.edu  This combined degree option, offered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Education meets the academic requirements for the New YorkState teaching certification for Social Studies (7-12). It is an alternative to the existing undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Education dual program in theseareas, and an option that often takes less time and fewer credits than earning the entire master’s degree in education after completion of a general Arts andSciences degree.  The combined bachelor’s/master’s teacher preparation programs were designed to meet the needs of Arts and Sciences undergraduates who, because of alater decision to become a teacher, would need to add a semester or more to their undergraduate study to complete the existing undergraduate Arts andSciences/Education program. It also serves those who want or need more flexibility in their undergraduate program than the dual undergraduate degreeallows.  Both the Arts and Sciences undergraduate degree with a major related to the subject to be taught, and the School of Education master’s degree are conferredat the same time, after all requirements are met – typically at the end of 5 years. Students begin taking education courses as undergraduates, including somein the fourth year that are taken for graduate credit, and apply to become graduate students for their last two semesters. Some summer study (notnecessarily at SU) may be required.  The combined program has a two-stage admission process. The first stage involves meeting with the School of Education contact as early as possible todevelop a plan, and, if a decision to pursue the program is made, completing a form signed by Education and a new declaration of program of study form inArts and Science to declare the Arts and Sciences program with “Teacher Preparation/5 year” appended to the title (e.g., “History (TchrPrep/5yr)” insteadof “History”). The second admission stage involves an application to the Graduate School. Each admission stage requires a minimum 3.0 cumulative GPAand a minimum 3.0 GPA in the courses from the subject to be taught. The second stage also requires successful performance in the undergraduate educationcourses.  The choices of Arts and Sciences majors, and the course requirements for the Arts and Sciences major, the Liberal Arts Core, and other requirements relatedto the major are the same for these combined programs as those for students completing the dual enrollment undergraduate Arts and Sciences/Educationprogram. These details about specific adjustments necessary to the Liberal Arts Core and to Arts and Sciences major may be found in the section describingDual Arts and Sciences/ Education Programs.  Because of the specific course requirements and sequencing of courses, it is important that students interested in one of these programs meet with theSchool of Education contact as soon as possible to develop a plan.

This journey expands analyticalskills, knowledge in a professional discipline that informs all aspects of society-locally, nationally and globally. Lawgraduates are distinctly capable of engaging the issues most critical to any community. More than ever in ourhistory every area of endeavor has some legal overlay-the law informs every issue. The law and the policies itdrives interconnect with the environment, technology, media, foreign policy, architecture, the family, humanrights and medicine. In fact, the list is as long as your imagination takes you. These limitless connections make alegal education so compelling and so important. The agenda you create, the path you take, the intellectual interests you bring with you and the ones yougenerate throughout your life, will be profoundly enhanced by an outstanding legal education. It would be difficult to find something the law doesn'tinfluence. Legal education prepares you for meeting the challenge of an increasingly complex world. A law degree has value whether you choose to practicelaw or to join the foreign service; whether you start your own company or serve as counsel to a college or university; whether you work in the technologyindustry or in a hospital; whether you write a novel or edit a newspaper; serve as a public defender or work in the justice department. You name the careerand law applies.  Our new home – Dineen Hall – opened in the Fall of 2014.  The 200,000 square foot Dineen Hall is a state-of-the-art facilty that will change the waystudents embrace their law school experience.

Studentscomplete the requirements for and receive two degrees–one degree in a major of their choice in engineering or computer science and one degree in a majorin the College of Arts and Sciences. Students who enter this program are urged to talk with advisors in both departments in which they plan to major assoon as possible. It is important that they learn the curricular requirements of each department in order to understand how best to merge the two sets of450requirements.Students register with the College of Arts and Sciences as the home college for the first three years. They receive a basic education in mathematics andscience along with a liberal education in the social sciences and humanities. While most of the coursework taken during that time is in the liberal arts,approximately one quarter of the program consists of first- and second-year courses in the engineering field chosen by the students.After completing the third year, students transfer the home college designation to the College of Engineering and Computer Science while maintaining aconnection with the College of Arts and Sciences. The fourth and fifth years of the program focus on engineering subjects. The B.A. or B.S. degree in theArts and Sciences major may be awarded upon completion of the fourth year, but increased scheduling options are possible by completing both degrees atthe end of the fifth year.While some flexibility is possible in the program, it is a formalized curriculum. Students usually major in mathematics, biology, physics, or chemistry in theCollege of Arts and Sciences, although other majors are allowed upon approval by both colleges. The completion of the combined degree program requires aminimum of 150 total credits earned.Admission requirements are the same as those for students entering the College of Engineering and Computer Science. Students who are already enrolled inthe College of Engineering and Computer Science or the College of Arts and Sciences may transfer into the combined program provided requirements can bemet. Such transfers must be approved by both colleges.Intra-University TransferStudents who wish to transfer into any program within the College of Engineering and Computer Science from another school or college within theUniversity should have a strong record of achievement and demonstrated success in key technical courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.00. Specifically, it iscritical for the applicant to have proven their ability to excel in college-level calculus (by completing at least one of  and  Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science (3) Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science (3) in the fall of the first year, students are introduced to the engineering method for problem solving, and concepts of engineeringdesign. In this way students see how mathematics, basic sciences, and engineering science provide the necessary tools for design and how to go about thedesign process.During the sophomore, junior, and senior years, problems of increasing complexity and open-endedness are presented to students in the chemicalengineering courses, continually challenging their technical expertise, creativity, and knowledge.Finally, in their senior year courses, students are required to complete major design projects in their courses and laboratory. These projects are open-endedand designed to build upon the students’ understanding and mastery of the fundamentals of mathematics, sciences, and engineering topics. They alsoconsider broader social issues in addition to technical issues such as environmental impact and safety.Many students take advantage of the low student/faculty ratio by participating in research or independent study projects. There are part-time, summer, co-op, and internship opportunities available for students seeking work experience. International study opportunities are also available.Graduates from the program in chemical engineering must achieve the following student outcomes:• an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;• an ability to design and conduct experiments, and to analyze and interpret data;• an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs;• an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;• an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;• an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;• an ability to communicate effectively;• the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context;• a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning;• a knowledge of contemporary issues;• an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice;• an appreciation of diversity issues in society.Chemical Engineering Course RequirementsFirst Year, Fall Semester (17) Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science (3) Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science (3) Introduction to Engineering & Computer Science and  Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science,  Introduction to Engineering and Computer Science (3) in the first year, students are requiredto formulate solutions to a variety of open-ended laboratory projects.

ZhangThe mission of the aerospace engineering program at Syracuse University is to educate and to promote learning and discovery in aerospace engineering andto prepare students for a career of technical excellence and professional growth and leadership in a complex and competitive technological environment.The program educational objectives of the aerospace engineering curriculum are to enable graduates of the program to do the following:• apply the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to professional practice or to advanced study in aerospace engineering or related fields;• be cognizant of societal context and ethical responsibility in professional practice;• function productively on teams and communicate ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences; and• be agile, innovative, and adaptable in an increasingly diverse and global environment.Opportunities for aerospace engineers will continue to expand within the military, civilian, and general aviation sectors spurred on by the development ofnew aircraft that extends to civilian supersonic aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. This growth in aircraft demand (as well as the need for higherefficiencies, longer ranges, and lower cost aircraft) is being fueled by the increasing global demand for air travel in the international marketplace. Spaceexploration has also entered a period of increased activity that includes an increased exploitation of satellites to service the demand for global455communication, the need for low-cost assured access to space, the international space station, and planetary missions.We prepare our students for this changing environment by providing an opportunity to gain marketable and relevant skills that can lead to success in a widerange of careers. The distinctive signature of undergraduate aerospace engineering at Syracuse University is the ability to fit a minor into the curriculum.Students explore the breadth of Syracuse University by complementing their aerospace engineering degree with a minor in business, public policy, fine arts,public communications, and many more.The technical focus of the B.S. program in aerospace engineering (AEE) is to develop a sound educational basis for the analysis and design of aerospacesystems, with emphasis on the structure, aerodynamics, flight/orbital mechanics, and propulsion of aircraft and spacecraft systems. Aerospace engineering isa field constantly pushing the limits of technology. The B.S. AEE program stresses the fundamental physical, mathematical, and engineering principles thatform the broadest base for future work in a fast-changing field.The B.S. AEE program is designed to prepare graduates for either immediate employment or for continuing studies at the graduate level. One distinguishingfeature of the program is the opportunity for undergraduate students to participate in current research projects, which provide first-hand exposure both toadvanced topics of current interest and to challenges typical of graduate school or industrial research. Research experiences for undergraduates are availablein many areas, including fluid dynamics, aerodynamics, solid mechanics, and applications of high-performance computers.Requirements for the B.S. AEE program appear below. For the first five semesters the recommended sequence of courses for the B.S. AEE program is nearlyidentical to the recommended program for the B.S. degree in mechanical engineering (MEE), which demonstrates the similarity and complementary natureof the two disciplines. Courses carrying the prefix MAE indicate class material and assignments are drawn from both aerospace and mechanical engineeringapplications. Beginning in the sixth semester, students in the B.S. AEE program begin taking courses addressing topics unique to aerospace engineering,including aerodynamics, aircraft structures, propulsion systems, and the dynamics of aerospace vehicles.Experience with open-ended design problems is obtained in a sequence of courses that span the entire curriculum. The sequence begins with introductorydesign experience in the first-year courses  Strategy and LeadershipEnvironmental EngineeringDepartment Chair: Dr. Ossama "Sam" Salem, 151 Link Hall, omsalem@syr.edu, 315-443-2311Program Director: Dr. Cliff I.

Moreno, Undergraduate Program Director, 315-443-1715518The Department of Child and Family Studies (CFS) is involved in the scientific investigation of children and families.  Students engage in multidisciplinarylearning about the challenges facing families and children across social, cultural, and contextual settings.  In addition, students study the factors thatpromote strengths and resiliency to foster healthy families and children. CFS students not only learn in the classroom, they receive first hand experience inthe community as well.  For example, CFS seniors are involved in a 180-hour community practicum that allows them to apply the knowledge gained in theclassroom to real life settings.  As a result, CFS students have a  comprehensive understanding of children and families in theory and in practice.Students in the 124 credit B.S. degree program pursue interests in one of four tracks of specialization: (a) Early Child Development, (b) Youth and FamilyDevelopment, (c)  Early Childhood Education (4+1), (d) Child Life Specialist. Core courses focus on child and youth development (i.e., infancy, play,interpersonal competence, human sexuality) and family development (i.e., parenting, marriage, domestic violence).  CFS also offers minors in Child andFamily Studies, Child and Family Policy and Mindfulness and Contemplative Studies.CFS graduates pursue careers working with children and families in a variety of areas including early education and intervention programs, social service andmental health agencies, the juvenile justice system, youth programs, schools and parent and family services.  Many students also pursue post baccalaureatedegrees in fields such as social work, psychology, medicine, family law, counseling, health care, and education as well as child and family studies. GRADUATERobert P. Moreno, Graduate Program Director; 315-443-2757A unique aspect of the Department of Child and Family Studies is the interdisciplinary training of the faculty who have advanced degrees in developmentalpsychology, sociology, education, and gerontology. The graduate programs (M.A., M.S., Ph.D.) integrate theory and practice from these fields to facilitateunderstanding of human development over the life span within and across diverse family and cultural settings. Supervised participation in early childhoodeducation and research programs provide students with firsthand experiences in applying and integrating theory.The department has a strong reputation for its pioneering work in infant development, parent education, child care, and parent-child relations in differentcultures.FACILITIESThe Bernice M. Wright Child Development Laboratory School provides opportunities for research, teacher training, and community service. Founded as amodel of the parent cooperative movement in early childhood education, the school includes parent involvement at the center of its mission. The school isstaffed by both graduate and undergraduate students and offers a strong inclusive component that embraces the developmental and cultural perspectives ofits children and families. Limited enrollment is open to both the University and local communities.The Jack Reilly Institute for Early Childhood and Provider Education was established through a generous gift from Syracuse University alumnus John D.Reilly III '69, G'70 and his wife, Patricia M. Reilly. Adopting a multidisciplinary approach, the Institute's mission is to conduct basic and applied researchand to provide training to early childhood professionals on culturally and developmentally-appropriate early childhood education practices and issuespertaining to childhood safety.Public Health, Food Studies And NutritionDepartment Of Public Health, Food Studies And NutritionRick Welsh, Department Chair, 315-443-4060304 Lyman HallThe Department of Public Health, Food Studies and Nutrition offers academic programs in: Child and Family Health in the Global Community, M.S.; FoodStudies, B.S.; Nutrition, B.S. ; Nutrition Science, B.S., M.A., M.S.; Public Health, B.S.; Addiction Studies (C.A.S.); Dietetic Internship (C.A.S.); and GlobalHealth (C.A.S.).  Students’ academic programs move outside of the classroom to gain hands-on experiences in their chosen field(s) of concentration. In 2011, to reflect faculty research and applied interests in public health, nutrition/nutrition science, and dietetics, the individual academic departments thatpreviously housed programs in these areas were combined into a singular signature department—the Department of Public Health, Food Studies andNutrition. Today, the faculty and students in the Department of Public Health, Food Studies and Nutrition are experiencing ever-increasing opportunitiesfor interdisciplinary research and experiential learning locally, nationally and globally in the areas of public and community health, nutrition, and foodstudies, as well as other fields related to these specialties.Food StudiesRick Welsh, Department Chair, 443-4060304 Lyman HallFaculty Tim Barr, Anne Bellows, Kimberly Johnson, Mary Ann P. Kiernan, Laura-Anne Minkoff-Zern, Rick Welsh, Evan Weissman  Our newest degree—the bachelor of science in food studies—helps students develop analytical skills and knowledge about links between food system519structure, dietary choices and health outcomes.Courses cover topics like food as medicine in disease prevention and treatment, women’s rights to adequate food and nutrition, and global rules forgoverning trade and distribution of food and agricultural products, among many others. Hands-on field learning is often linked to faculty affiliations withorganizations of professional significance, such as the USDA, UN and USAID. Students encounter many diverse opportunities, such as: • Experiential learning requirements that include a strong network of community-based partnerships and regional, national and international opportunities. • Global gastronomy studies, including specialized study abroad programming in Florence. • Hands-on learning in culinary labs working with professional chefs and experts in nutrition, food policy and public health. • One-on-one interactions with faculty experts in rights-based approaches to food and nutrition, scale-appropriate technologies to support ruraldevelopment, emerging food social movements, nutrition focused on pediatrics, and community education.Increased emphasis on healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, public interest in food policy, growing and aging populations, and diet-related disease epidemicscontinue to spur demand for our graduates.Intra-University TransfersThe Bachelor of Science in Food Studies accepts transfers into the program on a rolling admissions’ basis.Transfer applicants must schedule an interview with Dr. Rick Welsh, Food Studies Undergraduate Program Director, to review admission requirements.Applicants outside of the David B.

Connolly, 315-443-2386UNDERGRADUATEKay Stearns Bruening, Undergraduate Program Director, 315-443-2386The Nutrition Science and Dietetics program offers two major programs: nutrition/dietetics and nutrition science. Students may select one major programor choose a double-major with another program in the David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics or in another school or college. Students alsohave the opportunity to pursue a minor.Dietetics is the application of the knowledge of human nutrition to support the nutritional needs of the healthy as well as the sick. The study of humannutrition encompasses biology, physiology, chemistry, and the behavioral and social sciences. Students study the changes in nutritional needs throughout thelife cycle, examine the factors that influence the selection of foods, and explore ways in which diet can be modified.Additional courses in chemistry and the biological sciences are prerequisites for many human nutrition courses, which cover basic and advanced nutrition,medical nutrition therapy, practice of dietetics, community nutrition, food science, and food service systems.All students who complete degree requirements will be eligible for the B.S. in Nutrition. Additional requirements must be met to receive a dieteticsverification statement. Dietetic verification statement requirements are posted on the departmental website in the program handbook.Nutrition Science emphasizes the biological and physical sciences. In addition to food science, nutrition in health, medical nutrition therapy, and advancednutrition, studies include work in general and organic chemistry, biology, physiology, and biochemistry. In nutrition science, students prepare to pursuepost-graduate work in medicine, dentistry, education, or health care or work for major food or pharmaceutical companies. GRADUATESudha Raj, Graduate Program Director, 315-443-5573Graduate students in the Nutrition Science program acquire a balanced background in the theory and application of the science of nutrition. Specialization isdesirable and is achieved by appropriate course selection, readings, independent study, field experience, and research projects. Faculty members have520expertise in clinical nutrition, community nutrition, nutrition for growth and development, nutrition education, nutrition science, and food servicemanagement.The department is affiliated with a number of local hospitals, clinics, and community agencies that provide special learning and research experiences forstudents according to their background and interests.Public HealthRick Welsh, Department Chair, 315-443-4060304 Lyman HallFaculty  Dessa Bergen-Cico, James Byrne, Luvenia W.

Our graduates are prepared to work in communityhealth education and health promotion in public health agencies, as well as in newly emerging preventive health services in corporate wellness centers,college health services, insurance agencies, or pharmaceutical companies. Many also plan for graduate education in public health, health-related socialsciences (medical anthropology, medical sociology, or health psychology), law, and the health professions (medicine, nursing, physician assistance,pharmacy, or dentistry).The public health program includes a 46 credit liberal arts core, a 45 credit public health core, and a 32 credit elective requirement.  The public health coreincludes key public health concepts such as environmental health, epidemiology,  health systems administration, and social & behavioral determinants ofhealth as well as those specific to community health education, a sub-field within public health.  The generous number of electives facilitates the completionof minor(s) or a second major.  In addition, the flexibility of the program enables students to study abroad.Students frequently move outside the classroom to gain hands-on experience in initiatives to improve the health of individuals, families, and communities.Each student completes a 9-credit internship and capstone project during their senior year.Graduate ProgramBrooks Gump, Graduate Program Director, 315-443-2208, bbgump@syr.eduThe Public Health program offers advanced certificates in Addictions Studies and Global Health, and a master of science in Child and Family Health in theGlobal Community.The 24 credit hour Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Addiction Studies  is available only to Syracuse University students dually enrolled in a master'sdegree-granting program.  Only Internal applicants will be accepted.  The CAS in Addiction Studies provides an intensive concentration of coursework onthe biology, psychology and cross-cultural sociology of addictions as a supplement to a graduate program of study. The academic program is designed tosupport graduate study in fields such as anthropology, child and family studies, counseling, couples and family therapy, education, law, nutrition,psychology, public health, public policy, sociology, and social work, among others. Students are exposed to broad perspectives in the addictions fieldthrough the core curriculum, and may subsequently apply their courses toward their professional fields to expand employment and placement opportunities.Courses include an optional study abroad component in Amsterdam.  The Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) in Global Health is a 19-credit hour graduate program providing students applied skills in global health policy andpractice. The program emphasizes the integration of social and behavioral determinants of health combined with practice and evidence-based strategies fordeveloping, implementing, and evaluating programs and policies in global settings.The 36 credit graduate program in Child and Family Health in the Global Community offers students an in-depth and comprehensive understanding of thefactors influencing the health and well-being of children and families in the context of the global community. The program  examines a broad spectrum offactors, including infectious and chronic diseases, genetics and disabilities that require families to interface with medical care providers, service agencies, andpolicy decision makers in their communities. The program incorporates the study of cultural health norms and practices, barriers and facilitators of family-health practitioner relations and how children define and interpret their symptoms, how they feel about themselves, and how they respond to treatment.The program also integrates the study of historical experiences of ethnic groups (e.g., racial prejudice) and their culturally determined patterns of dealingwith issues of health and illness.The department also participates with Upstate Medical University in a Masters of Public Health Degree.

The goals of this program, in order of priority, are as follows:1. To prepare undergraduate students for competent and effective generalist professional practice by developing the requisite social work knowledge,values, and skills, and2. To prepare undergraduate students for continuing professional education and/or graduate education.The social work program is based on the concept of ecological systems, which maintains that the fundamental focus of social work practice is on thetransactions of people and their environments, and on the constant state of reciprocity in which each shapes the other. Social work intervention aims topromote the progressive forces and minimize the regressive forces in those transactions. The curriculum incorporates instruction in five professionalfoundation areas: social welfare policy and services, human behavior in the social environment, research, social work practice, and field practicum.Instruction in these areas builds upon a carefully chosen and strong liberal arts preparation in the humanities, the social and behavioral sciences, and thenatural sciences taken within the College of Arts and Sciences.The program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education.GRADUATEContact Carrie J. Smith, MSW Program Director, 315-443-5562.The School of Social Work educates practitioners grounded in social work values and evidence-informed practice to foster strengths and to respond tohuman service needs of local, state, national and global communities. We accomplish this in collaboration with the practice community through teaching,research, scholarship, and service aimed at achieving social and economic justice in a diverse society.The school offers two graduate programs leading to the master of social work (M.S.W.) degree. The first is a two-year M.S.W. program. The second is anadvanced standing program, open only to students who hold a bachelor’s degree in social work from a program accredited by the Council on Social WorkEducation. Both graduate programs prepare students for advanced social work practice and leadership. The graduate program is accredited by the Council onSocial Work Education.The social work program is based on the concept of ecological systems. This concept maintains that the fundamental focus of social work practice is on thetransactions of people and their environments and the constant state of reciprocity in which each shapes the other. Social work intervention aims topromote the progressive forces and minimize the regressive forces in those transactions.More than 200 social welfare and health agencies in Central New York provide graduate field instruction opportunities. Graduate students in the two-yeardegree program must complete 1000 hours of field experience concurrent with their academic work, thereby integrating classroom and field learning.Dual M.S.W./M.A. program in Social Work and Marriage and Family TherapyThe interdisciplinary program allows students to complete degrees in two distinct professions, the Master of Social Work (MSW) and the Master of Arts inMarriage and Family Therapy (MFT) in three years.  The dual degree exposes students to the philosophical and legal distinctions of both degrees, creates aunique opportunity for MSW students to deepen their clinical training with couples and families, and introduces MFT students to a broader range of socialwork and social welfare course offerings, as well as the art of clinical diagnosis which is in the scope of practice of the Social Work profession.The dual degree is offered as both a 96-credit, three –year program (for students not admitted to the Advance Standing MSW program), or a 78-credit two-year program (for students admitted to the MSW Advance Standing program).The program extends the advanced clinical preparation of the MSW to include an additional year of intensive MFT clinical supervision. It combines theMSW ability to work with systems of all sizes with the more singular focus on families by MFT.Joint Juris Doctor (J.D. and Master of Social Work (M.S.W.)The Juris Doctor/Master of Social Work is a joint degree which may be conferred by the College of Law and the Syracuse University School of Social Work.Students enrolled in these programs may obtain their J.D. and M.S.W. in substantially less time than would be necessary if both programs were separatelypursued. Candidates for admission to the joint degree program must first gain admission to each participating academic unit. Applicants for one of the jointLaw/Social Work programs must file a petition requesting admission to the joint degree program with the College of Law Interdisciplinary ProgramsCommittee. Interested students should contact the College of Law Advisor, who will assist in the preparation of the petition. The petition must state theproposed program’s objective and include a comprehensive plan of proposed study.  A Social Work faculty advisor will provide guidance to meet therequirements for the M.S.W.522The regular M.S.W. can be completed in conjunction with the J.D. in 3 years of full-time study with a total of 120 credit hours (72 Law and 48 SocialWork).  Persons with an accredited BSSW are eligible for the Advanced Standing program in social work (72 Law and 30 Social Work).ADMISSIONStudents in the two-year M.S.W. program begin full-time study only in the fall semester. Advanced standing students begin study in the second summersession. The awarding of the degree requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 in all courses required for the degree. All degree requirements must havebeen completed within seven years prior to the date of the degree award.Matriculated students who voluntarily interrupt graduate study for more than one academic year and wish to be re-admitted will be evaluated by the MSWProgram and Field Office directors. Required reevaluation criteria vary according to individual circumstances. The re-admission process is initiated by aletter to the director of the MSW program in the School of Social Work, outlining circumstances of interruption and plans for completion of graduatestudy.TRANSFER CREDITGraduate credit earned in another accredited graduate school and carrying a grade of B or higher may be transferred toward the M.S.W. degree, so long as itforms an integral part of the degree program and is approved by the School of Social Work. A maximum of 12 credits from other graduate study may betransferred toward the 60-credit M.S.W. degree requirement. Academic credit is not given for life experience or previous work experience. Advancedstanding M.S.W. students may not transfer credits from another college or university.Decisions regarding credit transfer are made independent of admissions decisions. Matriculation as a transfer student in the School of Social Work requirescompletion of the formal admissions process.PART-TIME STUDYStudents unable to enroll full time may complete the program through part-time study. Several options are available. Evening, daytime, and summer coursesare offered. Several courses may also be available in one week intensive “minimester” formats.FINANCIAL AIDA limited number of Syracuse University scholarships and fellowships are available to both first- and second-year graduate students on the basis of need andmerit.

Levy, Jacques Lewalle, Shalabh Maroo, Young Bai Moon, Vadrevu R. Murthy, UtpalRoy, Jianshun S. Zhang The mission of the mechanical engineering program at Syracuse University is to educate and promote learning and discovery in mechanical engineering andto prepare students for careers of technical excellence, professional growth, and leadership in a complex and competitive technological environment.The educational objectives of the mechanical engineering curriculum are to enable graduates of the program to do the following:•apply the physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to professional practice or  to  advanced study in mechanical engineering or related fields;•be cognizant of societal context and ethical responsibility in professional practice;•function productively on teams and communicate ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences; and•be agile, innovative, and adaptable in an increasingly diverse and global environmentIn order to meet the demands of new and existing high-tech industries, we prepare our students by providing opportunities to gain marketable and relevantskills that can lead to success in a wide range of careers. The distinctive signature of undergraduate mechanical engineering at Syracuse University is itsstrong technical core coupled with the ability to fit either a technical or a non-technical minor into the curricula. Students explore the breadth of SyracuseUniversity by complementing their mechanical engineering degree with a minor in business, public policy, fine arts, public communications, and manymore.Mechanical engineering is a broad discipline concerned with the design and analysis of systems that produce or modify motion, force, and energy into forms484useful to people. Mechanical engineers are employed throughout the complete spectrum of industries, including automotive, industrial machinery, publishingand printing, electrical and thermal power, chemical processing, textile, petroleum, computer and electronic, pharmaceutical, apparel, consumer products,soap and cosmetics, paper and wood products, rubber, and glass.Driven by the breadth of career paths open to mechanical engineering graduates, the B.S. program in mechanical engineering (MEE) is structured to providea firm educational foundation in the physical, mathematical, and engineering principles and design practices relevant to mechanical and thermal systems.The program is designed to prepare graduates for either immediate employment or for continuing studies at the graduate level.Requirements for the B.S. MEE program appear below. For the first five semesters the recommended sequence of courses for the B.S. MEE program is verysimilar to the recommended program for the degree B.S. in aerospace engineering (AEE), which demonstrates the complementary nature of the twodisciplines. Courses carrying the prefix MAE indicate that class material and assignments are drawn from both aerospace and mechanical engineeringapplications.Beginning in the sixth semester students who follow the B.S. MEE program begin to take courses addressing engineering topics unique to mechanicalengineering, including machine design and manufacturing and heat transfer. The last three semesters of the MEE program also include courses of more broadapplications, including dynamics of mechanical systems and linear control systems.Experience with open-ended design problems is obtained in a sequence of courses that span the entire curriculum. The sequence begins with introductorydesign experiences in the first-year courses "
MEE 471,",472) requires students to integrate knowledge from all areas in the design of a complete product or system.The B.S. MEE curriculum allows for programs of study that can be tailored by students to take advantage of the diversity of strengths across both ECS andall of Syracuse University. We provide engineering students with opportunities to complete minors in areas that can complement technical knowledge–suchas international affairs, business, and public policy–thus enhancing the value and attractiveness of a Syracuse University engineering education. Students canalso elect to pursue a University minor or take a distribution of electives, which will include liberal arts classes, free electives, and additional depth inmechanical engineering. There are a total of 27 elective credits (9 electives) in the B.S. MEE program; one of these electives (3 credits) must be in SocialSciences/Humanities (SS/H); two (6 credits) must be MAE technical electives, one of which must be either  Synthesis of Mechanical Systems I (3).

TheiSchool at Syracuse—the original information school—is a leader in the information field, which lies at the intersectionof management, technology, and people. The iSchool offers an innovative curriculum that is continuously updated tomeet future industry trends and incorporate rapidly changing technologies. The iSchool at Syracuse University iscurrently ranked No. 1 in information systems, according to U.S. News & World Report.Our approach stands out from other institutions that offer computer science, management, information science, andrelated programs in that our focus is on users and user information needs as a starting point for integrating informationand information technology into organizations. The faculty combines expertise in information systems, linguistics,computer science, library science, education, business management, school media, digital literacy, managementinformation systems, telecommunications, wireless and emerging technologies, and communication. The faculty are very active in research topics thatreflect their diverse intellectual backgrounds and interests.The Central Themes of the School of Information StudiesFive basic themes express the school's research and teaching mission. These themes define our vision of the information field and provide a focus for boththe design of our curriculum and our sponsored research.The Interrelationship Among the Five Central Themes of the School of Information Studies: Information and Telecommunications Management considers information and technologies within organizational contexts.Information in the Marketplace relates how organizations interact with each other and exchanging information and products.Information Representation and Retrieval forms the building blocks of information systems as well as the processes necessary to enable humans toaccess and use information.Human-Information Interaction focuses on people and how the individual or group seeks and uses the products of information representation andretrieval.Information and Society considers the implications and issues for culture and society of the broad scope of information systems and technologies.The School of Information Studies offers the following degree programs:UndergraduateBachelor of Science in Information Management and TechnologyBachelor of Science in Systems and Information ScienceDual Major with the Martin J. Whitman School of ManagementDual Major with the S.I.

LiddyThe greatest challenge facing us in our increasingly digital world is the potential for the wealth of information that now exists to create a poverty ofattention. We as a society need to better organize, represent, locate, and provide information efficiently and effectively, or risk being consumed by thisoverabundance of information. That’s where the Syracuse University School of Information Studies (iSchool) makes one of its most significantcontributions.Our vision is to expand human capabilities through information. What matters is that we make a difference in everything we do, and that this difference is apositive one affecting individuals, organizations, and ultimately society. We intend to add value to society through education and through the information,systems, and services we help to create. We pledge to do this ethically, competently, professionally, with respect for the individual, and with passion.We connect people to the information they seek so they can make the best decisions for their organizations—whether their business is commerce,government, entertainment, communications, medicine, education, or human services. All of these organizations make decisions and take actions based onthe information that is known. Our graduates ensure that they have the most accurate and appropriate information from which to base those decisions.Originally founded as a library science school in 1896, our school was the first in its field to embrace the information revolution by becoming the OriginalInformation School in 1974.Today, the iSchool is ranked No. 1 in information systems for library and information schools by U.S. News and World Report and serves as a model forother information schools that are emerging around the globe.Our expertise in information management is attracting the attention of companies as well as governments and organizations around the globe that competeto recruit our graduates. Our faculty members are working with global leaders in the information technology industry in research and curriculum dvelopmentin such areas as  green data centers, global collaboration, big data, and identity management and access control.We educate our library and information science students to take leadership positions in and to develop forward-looking policies and guidelines for librariesand other organizations. Our school media faculty members and graduates are changing policies to improve the quality of education and to motivatelearning in students of all ages.Our faculty and alumni of the telecommunications and network management program are reshaping Internet governance and telecommunications policiesaround the globe, securing our networks and information systems, and expanding access to information communication and technology through innovativeproduct design and implementation.Our faculty members are masters of many academic fields and work across traditional disciplinary lines, and they teach our students to do the same. Thisunified diversity is the strength of the school as well as of the information field itself. The information profession is the field of the future, and we inviteyou to become part of this future. Let us provide you with the skills to achieve positive change at the intersection of management, technology, and people.Join us! Vision And ValuesThe School of Information Studies, established in 1896 and renamed as the first Information School in 1974, has a long tradition of leading innovation andchange. Our ideals and values are the foundation for our success.Our VisionTo expand human capabilities through information.What matters is that we make a difference in everything we do, and that this difference is a positive one affecting individuals, organization, and ultimatelysociety. We intend to add value to society through education and through the information, systems, and services we help to create. We pledge to do thisethically, competently, professionally, with respect for the individual, and with passion.Our ValuesInquiry. We are dedicated to exploration. Exploration and innovation are critically important to the information field and a vital part of ourschool. We share the university's vision of being a leading student-centered research university by dedication to being a student-centered researchcollege. We promote this aim through discovery, development, application, integration, and active learning.Individuality. We are committed to the individual. High-performance organizations are composed of high-performance individuals. Our faculty,staff, students, and partners are risk takers who have a high tolerance for ambiguity. While we value our work together in a highly spirited teamatmosphere, we value the individual, and respect individuality as such. Our organizational norms dictate that we are relentless in attacking554problems, but supportive in valuing individual differences.Diversity. We are intellectually diverse. Complex problems require multidimensional and interdisciplinary analysis and solutions. The schoolfosters a multiplicity of “voices” addressing the important areas of teaching and research in the information field. The school seeks faculty frommany related disciplines who respect a diversity of opinion and perspective, and thrive on the tension of discussion and debate.Adaptability. We are adaptive and able to evolve. Today's competitive, complex, and ever-changing environment requires innovation, flexibility,and rapid responses. Our initiatives and developmental processes are driven by a Do-Learn-Revise model. This model encourages entrepreneurshipand risk-taking, celebrating success as a community achievement and embracing challenge as a learning opportunity.Unity. We are a faculty of one. The faculty sits as a whole, not as individuals or groups who represent one specific program in which they teach orascribe affiliation. Students and faculty are challenged to benefit from the paradox of a single information field manifested in many professionalexpressions. Students and faculty learn from each other by shared intellectual experiences and by appropriate curriculum integration across thedegree programs.Continuity. We are an enduring organization. With over a century of innovation and leadership behind us, the school makes an enduringcontribution to our field. In building our school we concentrate on building an enduring organization that goes beyond the influence of anyparticular dean or member of the faculty.Our GoalTo transform the information field through leadership in research, development, and education.Our Points of DistinctionWhatever we do, we do through information and for peopleThrough information we transform individuals, organizations, and societyWe recognize that information technology and management processes are means and not endsResearch CentersMany of the faculty conduct their research individually and in small, flexible, interdisciplinary teams.

Newhouse School of Public Communications. Students may combine the information management andtechnology degree major with any of the Newhouse majors, including advertising; broadcast and digital journalism; graphic arts; magazine;photography; public relations; and television, radio, and film. This 128-141 credit dual program of study prepares students to work in theinformation technology intense world of public communication. Newhouse is the home college.Overview:The B.S. in Information Management and Technology teaches students to understand the value of information to society, organizations, and individualprofessionals. Students are prepared to analyze the information needs of individuals and organizations and to design and manage information systems thatmeet specific needs.Information is now recognized by many organizations as their most valuable resource. Information professionals are employed by a variety oforganizations, including governments, health care facilities, research institutes, legal services, large and small retail industries, banks and investmentcompanies, sports and entertainment industries, consulting firms, colleges and universities, and international agencies.The study of information focuses on the use and users of information as much as upon the systems that manipulate it. Students must have a broad educationin the sciences, social sciences, and humanities, as well as in the areas of information management and information technologies.All students take an information management and technology primary core of 24-25 credits, which includes basic courses in information technology,information-based organizations, and information management. Students select five additional information management and technology courses from thefollowing concentrations:Information Security,Project Management,Network Management,Web Design and Management,Database Management; andDigital Retail StrategiesCourses within the information management and technology curriculum prepare students for a wide array of positions that:perform organizational information needs analysis and information planning;formulate information and information technology policies and procedures;conduct research and development in information technologies appropriate to support an organization’s mission;facilitate technology transfer between organizational units;monitor and evaluate information resources, including information sources, services, and technologies;coordinate information resources management across and outside an organization; andbudget for and acquire information resources.Students may further focus on an area of interest by incorporating one or more concentrations into their coursework, thus enhancing their resumes andmarketability.As information specialists are in high demand in the marketplace, careers are not limited to specific disciplines or industries. Our graduates are highly soughtfor such positions as information security managers, information management consultants, web design and development managers, database developers,project managers, process managers, database designers and managers, systems and design analysts, network administrators and managers, technologyevaluators, user training and support technicians, and many other roles.Some students may prefer to continue their education after receiving the bachelor’s degree in order to pursue a professional career in such fields as business,education, government, law, librarianship, or medicine. The B.S. degree is an excellent pre-professional degree in that it combines a broad liberal artseducation with computer and information technology skills; information seeking, use, and presentation skills; and a conceptual understanding ofinformation’s role in the modern society and economy.Students graduating with a major or minor from the iSchool can petition to waive up to 6 credits toward one of the school’s master’s degree programs,thereby reducing the number of credits needed to complete the graduate degree.Information management and technology majors often complement their programs with a minor.

With the combination of three full-time faculty, a technician, extensive facilities and highly qualified graduatestudents, the Ceramics Program is more than capable to provide a Minor degree.While candidates for this degree may come from any discipline within the University, the Ceramics Program has a history of attracting students fromArchitecture, Industrial Design, Geology, Engineering and Business. The Ceramics Program teaches equally to the fine art major, as well as students of craftand to the many architectural and industrial practices that involve ceramic processes. The field of ceramics has direct historical ties with design,engineering, architecture, geology, business and studies in art history. Indirectly the connections broaden to incorporate literature, poetry, philosophy andpolitics as they pertain to the ceremonies and content that surround ceramic objects and their relevance to cultural identity.The prospective advantage of minors working alongside majors is very exciting considering the different expertise that students from other majors at theUniversity will bring to their ceramic work and to the content and conversation among the studio arts major population in the Ceramics Program. This hasbeen the experience of the Ceramics Faculty over the years as they have numerous exceptional and engaged students expressing a desire to minor in thisexciting and historically rich major.ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS:•3.0 gpa•Must enter by the beginning of Junior Year.•Limit of 18 students accepted at any one time (subject to review).

Students must contactan advisor in the chosen major field to discuss specific requirements.12Management ElectivesA management elective is any upper-division course in the Whitman School that gives credit but is not used to fill requirements in othergroups. A maximum of 3 credits from the student’s major area may be used as management elective credit.6Free ElectivesStudents complete additional credits from any credit-bearing course with the following conditions: at least 6 credits must be non-management coursework; no more than 3 credits of physical education, health, or music ensemble may be used; and students may not takecourses considered to have content that duplicates courses already taken.9Global DiversityWhitman students must have some form of global experience. For many students, this is achieved through study abroad. Students may also fulfill therequirement with the completion of two courses from the Global Diversity Electives list (which may fulfill other course requirements for the degree).COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENTStudents are required to apply their management skills and knowledge to community problems. This is realized through a Community Service LearningAgreement in which 75 hours are completed throughout the undergraduate experience.InternshipStudents must have at least one experience, after they acquire junior standing, consisting of substantive and supervised work that complements theiracademic program (120 internship hour). This is accomplished through completing a course that requires internship participation, an independent study forexperience credit with a professor, or an Internship Learning Agreement.GRADING POLICYThe faculty at the Whitman School developed a uniform grading policy for the undergraduate program.  The policy has three goals: (1) to ensure thatgrading is fair and consistent across courses, (2) to encourage students to take their coursework seriously, and (3) to ensure faculty deliver a challengingacademic experience. The policy is as follows: For all undergraduate courses taken at the Whitman School with 15 or more students enrolled, the mean grade shall be no higherthan 3.3 and the maximum percentage of A/A- is 33%.Multiple sections taught by the same professor will be aggregated together to calculate the mean grade and percentage of A/A- awarded.  Deviations to theabove policy may occur depending on individual class performance.Other Programs And ServicesDUAL PROGRAMSThe Whitman School, in cooperation with other schools and colleges within the University, offers dual programs that make it possible for students topursue two programs of study concurrently. Students in these programs are assigned an advisor in each college.Students enrolled in dual programs fulfill degree requirements in each school and receive one degree (one diploma) jointly conferred by both schools. Dualprograms require more than 123 credits, normally required for graduation, but can often be completed within four years. The Whitman School offers dualprograms with the School of Information Studies and the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications.  The Whitman/Newhouse dual degree programrequires a minimum of 151 credits.  The Information Studies/Whitman dual degree program requires a minimum of 142 credits.

Thecollege provides the tools for self-discovery and risk-taking in an environment that thrives on critical thought andaction.The College of Visual and Performing Arts is dedicated to nurturing the creative and scholarly abilities of its students.The college, which is at the center of the University’s cultural life, is organized into four areas: the School of Art andDesign, the Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies, the Department of Drama, and the Setnor Schoolof Music. Recognizing the link between education, understanding, and cultural knowledge, the College of Visual andPerforming Arts is also committed to providing sites for learning about diversity throughout its curricula.General RegulationsFor academic rules and regulations that apply to all University students, see the Academic Rules and Regulations section of this catalog, which also containsspecial regulations that apply to all undergraduate students matriculated in the College of Visual and Performing Arts.INTRA-UNIVERSITY TRANSFERApplications for intra-University transfer are available in the Office of Recruitment and Admissions, 202 Crouse College. Applications are held until theend of the semester.TRANSFER CREDITTransfer of credit is considered only for courses that may be applied to the program in which the student is interested. In the School of Art and Design,Department of Drama, Department of Transmedia, and the Setnor School of Music, transfer students often have an excess of credits in academic subjectsthat cannot be applied to a specific program due to the high number of studio credits required. The result may be that the period of undergraduate study isextended beyond the typical four years. In the Setnor School of Music, placement examinations in music theory and applied music are also required beforecredit is accepted.In all cases, transfer credit is evaluated after admission. Credits—not grades or honor points—are transferred from other institutions. Only credits earned atSyracuse University are counted in the grade point average.FEESAll students matriculated in a VPA major or minor are charged a program fee that covers certain expenses such as applied music instruction, specializedstudio art supplies, dramatic productions, visiting artists, and equipment and technology. Non-VPA students are charged an applied music fee for privateinstruction and a per credit fee for other VPA courses. See the SU Tuition, Fees and Related Policies bulletin for specific charges.The First - Year ExperienceAll first-year students are assigned faculty advisors to help them plan their programs. In all five areas of the college, first-year courses and programs addressthe adjustment and integration of first-year students into college life. In each area, the emphasis is on small class size, one–to–one contact with faculty, thedevelopment of skills, and the personal appropriateness of each student’s choice of professional pursuit.First-year students in one of the School of Art and Design’s B.F.A. art and design programs or the B.I.D. program take the foundation program, whichincludes both required and elective academic options. In the Department of Transmedia, the first-year student experience is designed to introduce studentsto studio practice, history, and theory of the media, with an emphasis on the interconnectedness of all four areas of transmedia.In the Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies, first-year students are part of a comprehensive introductory program led by faculty and staff,incorporating a lecture series, information meetings, alumni panels, and advising. The entire first-year class takes two courses that involve small discussiongroups of approximately 20 students. In the courses, students meet with faculty and teaching assistants to address issues of concern in their discipline.In the Department of Drama, student involvement in theatrical activity is immediate. During the first year students participate in the department’sfoundation program. Each week drama faculty and students gather for Wednesday Lab, which includes presentations of scenes from class, guest artists, talkswith alumni, and other panel discussions.681In the Setnor School of Music, a weekly student convocation brings the entire school community together for performances by their peers, faculty, andmany guest artists. In addition to many hours of individual practice, the school encourages the development of skills needed for functioning in groupsituations. Thus, students are required to be involved in one of the school’s large ensemble groups each semester.School Of Art And DesignDepartment of Art, 102 Shaffer Art Building, 315-443-4613Department of Design, The Warehouse, First Floor, 315-443-2455Department of Foundation, 222 Smith Hall, 315-443-2251Department of Transmedia, 102 Shaffer Art Building, 315-443-1033The School of Art and DesignAs a professional school within a major university, the School of Art and Design offers a wealth of academic resources and endless opportunities andactivities.

ART 250," Filmmaking: Cinematic Modes and 253(offered by the School of Art and Design).Communication And Rhetorical StudiesContact Charles Morris, Chair, 100 Sims Hall, 315-443-2308 #faculty#Communication and Rhetorical Studies constitute the fiber with which we weave a framework of interaction among and between people, groups, and society.It is a highly complex process requiring observation, examination, and dynamic personal involvement. A comprehensive education based on a mastery ofall the aspects involved in communication and rhetorical studies guarantees the student life-long benefits academically, personally, and professionally.The Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies at Syracuse University prepares students to become adept thinkers, competent decision makers,and versatile professionals. Individuals skilled in the theory and practice of communication and rhetorical studies have almost unlimited careeropportunities. They are found in every business and profession. The majority of communication and rhetorical studies majors pursue careers in internallyoriented corporate and organizational communication and/or externally oriented corporate and public information. In recent years, virtually every graduateof the Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies has received and accepted a challenging job offer, continued on to a professional school, orpursued a graduate degree in communication and rhetorical studies.The world is increasingly more dependent on a complex system of communication. Individuals equipped with finely tuned skills in the area ofcommunication are highly sought by potential employers and highly valued by society as a whole. The Department of Communication and RhetoricalStudies offers students the opportunity to make the most of their potential by making the most of the program.The Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies is devoted to the study of human symbolic activity, chiefly as it is constituted through spokenlanguage. Communication and rhetorical studies is envisioned as a fundamental human process through which individuals learn to adapt to and createlinkages with their social, psychological, and physical environments; develop higher mental processes; and regulate their own behavior as well as that ofothers. Education in communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University focuses on the development of communication competence; studentslearn how communication is used in constructing social contexts and in articulating decisions to achieve specific outcomes.Aware that message-related behaviors vary as participants, settings, and conditions change, departmental faculty use a variety of methods and theories toinvestigate and explain the richness in human communicative behavior. Appropriately, the Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies embracesand embodies a pluralistic view in its approach to instruction in communication and rhetorical studies.The Department of Communication and Rhetorical Studies embraces diversity as a core component in its curricular offerings. People always communicatewithin particular contexts, creating unique and complex relationships between speakers, messages, audiences, and occasions. Responding to this, thedepartment has ensured that most courses address the concept of diversity and develop students’ cultural awareness and ability to adapt and respond to thedemands of the communication situations they encounter and create.Students pursue a B.S. degree in communication and rhetorical studies by taking 36 credits in communication and rhetorical studies, 54 credits in arts andsciences, and 30 credits in University-wide electives. In this program, students integrate studies in communication and rhetorical studies with courses fromother professional schools and the College of Arts and Sciences.Special Services and ProgramsHONORS IN COMMUNICATION AND RHETORICAL STUDIESOutstanding students are encouraged to pursue honors in communication and rhetorical studies. Exceptional students may undertake a project of their ownchoosing under the direction of a faculty member. Project reports are presented at the end of the semester.For further information about the Honors Program, contact the Office of Student Affairs, 204 Crouse College, or the Honors Program, 306 Bowne Hall.STUDY ABROADThe College of Visual and Performing Arts, through the Syracuse University Abroad (SU Abroad), provides communication and rhetorical studies majorswith the opportunity to study in London or Madrid.

Along with traditional drama requirements, students have the option of selectingsupport courses from the University’s other professional schools, including art and music. Each program requires 94-100 credits in the selected discipline,drama and related support courses, which are selected by the student and advisor to achieve specific professional goals. The remaining 30 credits are devoted685to academic courses outside of the department.During the first year of study, students in the Acting and Musical Theater Programs concentrate on building fundamental skills rather than on performance.Students in both programs share classes in acting, movement, and voice. In addition to these Core courses, Musical Theater students begin their training indance and singing. Freshman Design and Technology Students begin their studies in art foundation, theater design and stagecraft, and in their second yearbegin studies specific to their area of interest (scenic, costume or lighting). Stage Management students begin with a foundation in theater, stagemanagement, and stagecraft from the first year.Continuation in the B.F.A. program in Acting or Musical Theater is based on faculty evaluation of the student’s classwork and personal commitment at theend of the second year of study. However, this is not the only evaluation. All students in the department are evaluated periodically to see whether theircommitment and development warrant continuation in the program they have selected.B. S. Degree in DramaThe B.S. degree in Drama is structured much like the traditional arts and sciences degree and enables students to incorporate the intensive training of thedrama program with a broad education in the liberal arts. Students interested in the B.S. degree may choose a track (concentration) in Acting, Directing,Playwriting or in Theater Technology, providing they have been admitted to and have completed a portion of the BFA program. However, Students maybe directly admitted into the Theater Management B.S. track.The B.S. degree requires 120 credits, including a minimum of 50 credits in the liberal arts, and a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C). In addition to theliberal arts distribution of requirements, students must select an 18-credit minor or academic specialization in an academic (non-studio) area of study. Theymay take additional credits if they wish to satisfy their own interests.SYRACUSE STAGESyracuse Stage is a professional (LORT Equity) theater company. Together with the Department of Drama, it forms part of an unusual University-professional theater affiliation. The close relationship between a major professional theater serving the city and a vigorous University undergraduateprogram for training young professionals is fostered by their common home in one complex.Drama students earn credits by assisting professional directors, designers, and technicians and by appearing in productions at Syracuse Stage; in turn, thestaff of the professional theater is involved in all the productions of the drama department, supervising and assisting student designers and technicians withtheir work. Some student actors are cast in professional productions, and all students profit from the experience, advice, and example of professional actors,designers, directors, and resident staff working in the same building. A number of specialized drama department classes are taught by members of theSyracuse Stage staff who are part-time adjuncts to the faculty.STUDY ABROADThe College of Visual and Performing Arts, through Syracuse University Abroad, provides students in the Department of Drama with the opportunity todraw upon the unparalleled theater resources of London, England, or design resources in Florence, Italy, through study abroad.

It combines theintensive training of the Drama Department with a broad education in the liberal arts. Students enrolled in the B.S. degree may choose a track(concentration) in Directing, Playwriting, Theater Technology or Acting, provided that they have been admitted to, and have completed a portion of, aDrama BFA program. However, students may be directly admitted into the Theater Management B.S. track.The B.S. degree requires 120 credits, including a minimum of 50 credits in the liberal arts, and a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (C). In addition to theliberal arts distribution of requirements, students must select an 18-credit minor or academic specialization in an academic (non-studio) area of study. Theymay take additional credits if they wish to satisfy their own interests.The new Theater Management track will prepare you for a variety of careers including producing, marketing and public relations, casting, development, andgeneral management. It will also provide you with the chance to develop widely transferable management skills. Working in direct partnership withprofessionals at Syracuse Stage, you will gain firsthand knowledge of a professional theater company’s operations.The Acting and Theater Technology tracks in the B.S. program are more broadly focused than the B.F.A. programs. This allows you to tailor your courseof studies to your individual interests, and facilitates the pursuit of a minor in an area of your choice, while still enabling you to take advantage of theDepartment’s many resources – including opportunities to study abroad, and our partnership with Syracuse Stage.Please note that the Theater Management track is the only B.S. track that is currently open to direct application (which includes an interview).

This B.F.A. degree major emphasizes conceptual development andvideo design skills grounded in advanced production and post-production studio work. Within the context of the Department of Transmedia, The videooption encourages a multidisciplinary approach to video, providing opportunities for students to interact with fellow students majoring in art photography,computer art, and film. Art video majors are immersed in the history and theory of moving image/sound relationships so that their work is informed andstrengthened.694Art video maintains an active visiting artists program and one of the best collections of artists’ video in the United States. Students investigate the manyways video technology is used creatively today: as single channel works challenging the conventions of narrative and documentary form; as a visual artform integrating computer -generated images, audio experimentation, and performance art; as a primary source of creative content for the World WideWeb and as a sculptural medium used in site-specific installations. Beginning courses examine technical principles, and assignments introduce students to thevideo medium’s complex nature and potential power. At first, students develop ideas with their instructors, but in the junior and senior years, their workbecomes increasingly self-directed. The goal is the emergence of independent, personally motivated work.The art video program is supported by a multiple-format video facility. Production equipment includes mini-DV camcorders, digital audio field recorders,and necessary peripherals. Post-production suites include digital non-linear editing systems; multi-format, multi-standard dubbing stations; dedicated, digital,non-linear audio-to-video suites; a large green-screen shooting stage; and access to other University facilities that further complement post-productionwork.This major is designed to prepare students for careers in video art (a multidisciplinary field focused on creative video information design).In addition to becoming independent video artists, art video graduates may become specialists in a growing number of professional sectors, including musicvideo and World Wide Web content provision, and production and post-production for the education, training, publishing, and entertainment industries,forensic, environmental and political media analysis, as well as in-house video producers for major corporations in the United States and abroad.MAJOR REQUIREMENTS First Year, Fall Semester  Art Photography, Introduction 3SIntroduction to analog and digitalphotography, beginning with 35 mm camerabasics, film processing and printing.Correlating digital processes (basic filmscanning, etc.) will be taught alongside theiranalog counterparts.

Johnson, Amos Kiewe, Kendall Phillips, AmardoRodriguez, Bradford VivianThis program allows students to integrate their individual professional interests with a thorough background in communication and rhetorical studies and aselection of arts and sciences courses. The 120 credits required for the B.S. degree are divided into 36 credits in communication and rhetorical studies, 54credits in arts and sciences, and 30 credits in University-wide electives.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSStudents must complete a total of 120 credits. Of these, 36 credits must be in communication and rhetorical studies, including "
CRS 181,",183, 225, and 287.Students must also take 54 credits in arts and sciences, including 6 credits in writing (English); 6 credits in the natural sciences and mathematics; 6 credits inthe social sciences; 6 credits in the humanities, including foreign language proficiency at a 102 level (American Sign Language does not fulfill thisrequirement, although it can be taken as an Arts and Sciences elective); and 30 credits in areas supporting their studies in communication.As of the academic year 2005-06, all communication and rhetorical studies majors who also pursue a second major, an additional minor, or attend one oftheSU Abroad centers for a semester, are allowed to enroll in up to 57 credits in non-arts-and-sciences courses. This modification means thatcommunication and rhetorical studies majors who fall under one or more of the above categories (double major, minor, or SU Abroad) are no longer requiredto pursue 54 credits in arts and sciences courses but are given greater flexibility in taking more non-arts-and-sciences courses.

Through instruction in 3D computer animation, electronic object creation, code-based art, sound design, andsonic art, students are mentored to become highly skilled critical thinkers producing art in individual and collaborative contexts.In your first year, you build a strong foundation for working within the digital realm while developing an artistic voice engaged in the language of themedium. During the second year we investigate the diverse possibilities of computer art, the intensity of which is oriented by the inclination of the studentand tailored through mentorship. In the third and fourth years, we bring these skills into creative focus, demanding a professional art practice that is bothtechnically sophisticated and critically engaged.Within the Department of Transmedia, computer art is integrated with film, art video, and art photography, allowing for a practice that is tightly focusedbut free to traverse a network of related disciplines. This network expands into the rest of Syracuse University, challenging you to further develop theintellectual resources needed to inform your work. Through this process you synthesize a perspective that is shaped within a web of mutual influence anddiscourse.Celebrating its 30th year, the computer art program boasts alumni who are placed at some of the most prestigious animation and visual effects companies inthe world—Pixar, Rhythm and Hues, Industrial Light and Magic, Lucasarts, Blizzard, Tippett Studios, Motion Picture Company, and Sony PicturesImageworks—along with creative representation at galleries and media art festivals internationally. The program’s alumni and faculty have consistentlypushed the edge publicly as to what it means to be a computer artist and continue to maintain that intensity today.

The film program places equal emphasis on academic film studies and creative production. Students pursue various modes of production,including experimental, narrative, documentary, and animation and are required to take film history, theory and criticism classes.Our approach is that of the total filmmaker. The primary focus of the program is to foster creative, intellectual, and personal achievement. Students learneverything from scriptwriting to pre-production, production, and post- production. Learning how to develop interpersonal and leadership skills is animportant part of the process. The program encourages independence, debate, and originality. Our approach to film is an aesthetic one rather than acommercial enterprise.The first two years of the program are rigorously structured. Freshmen follow Transmedia core curriculum, including film history and an introductory filmproduction course. Sophomore classes concentrate on the essential filmmaking skills. Juniors and seniors have more flexibility. Students choose from menu-structured courses according to their academic and professional interests, in essence constructing their own path with their faculty advisor. This structurepermits students to study abroad for one semester in any of the SU Abroad locations. The film program also offers both semester-long and short-term studyprograms with FAMU in Prague.Students must participate in a portfolio review, which is held at the end of each semester. The student and faculty members evaluate creative and academicwork and assess student progress. Sophomore Review will result in a recommendation to continue or to not continue in the program.In addition to the core study and study abroad options, students have various opportunities for involvement with the Syracuse International Film Festival,the Dropped Frame Society (a student-run film organization), and are encouraged to seek internships. Each year, two of our film seniors participate in the“Sorkin Week,” a week-long professional sojourn in Los Angeles, California.The program maintains full facilities for 16mm, super 16mm, and digital video formats, including HD.Our students go on to become independent filmmakers and educators, and work in a wide variety of media-related fields. The program requires 129 credits.MAJO R REQ UIREMENTSFirst Year, Fall Semester"

Meighanvpa.syr.edu/art-design/art/undergraduate/history-artThe interdisciplinary program in the history of art, which leads to a B.F.A. degree and requires 126 credits, integrates studio experience with study of thehistory, theory, and aesthetics of the visual arts. Intended for students who have taken basic studio courses in drawing, painting, and design but who do notwish to specialize in one of the professional studio fields, it offers a diversified course of study in history and related academic concerns.The program examines art as an expression of experience in different periods and cultures, from prehistoric to contemporary. Students may develop anarea of specialization in a topic that interests them, such as a period (Middle Ages, Age of Romanticism, Industrial Age), a stylistic movement (Baroque,Impressionism, Abstract Impressionism), a medium (decorative arts, architecture), a focus based on geography (American art, art of the northern710Renaissance), or a combination of all four.For study in the history of art, students may choose art history courses above the 299 level offered in the College of Visual and Performing Arts listed withan ART prefix, or courses in the art history major offered by the Department of Fine Arts in the College of Arts and Sciences, which are listed with a FIAprefix. History of art majors may also choose courses from other undergraduate colleges within the University.MAJOR REQUIREMENTSFirst Year, Fall SemesterART101 First-Year Colloquium 1Art or design history 3FND Studio 3FND Studio 3"

It isaccredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design and exceeds the educational minimums recommended by theIndustrial Designers Society of America (IDSA). The program consists of courses in design theory and practice, as well as support coursesin the humanities, the physical and natural sciences, and the behavioral and social sciences. The responsive curriculum maintains abalance between technical, aesthetic, and humanistic aspects and keeps pace with the leading edge of design technology by anticipatingdevelopments in the field.Upper-level students in the program participate in collaborative projects with business, industry, and government agencies. These projectschallenge students with real-life design problems. Industrial and interaction design students have an active chapter of the IDSA, whichplans lecture programs, organizes field trips to consultant and corporate design offices, and participates in regional and national meetingsof the society.Students may also apply to spend one semester of their fourth year at the SU Abroad Center in London.MAJOR REQUIRE Illustration Research Problems 3YDesign and development of graphic projects.Information gathering methods usingphotography, library, and archival research.

Theflexibility of the curriculum allows students to select the directions they wish their work to take, such as jewelry making, silversmithing, or processes thatmove across these traditions. In fact, students are encouraged to experiment across media lines so that traditional involvement with non-precious andprecious metals is mixed with the exploration of plastics, woods, gemstones, and other materials.Students in the program make objects that range from the highly functional to the purely expressive. They study such jewelry and metalsmithing techniquesas forming, joining, molding, stonecutting, stone setting, and surface decorating. Related studies in the classical and contemporary uses of materials andtools, rendering, and small sculpture provide topics for independent research and investigation.Excellent studio facilities and attentive instruction from professional artists provide a balanced experience in fine crafts making and industrial processes.Through close contact with faculty members, students participate in frequent group and individual critiques and are assisted in identifying and pursuingprogram and career goals.The program in jewelry and metalsmithing requires 126 credits. First-year art and design majors are invited to enroll in introductory level classes. FND Requirements include: Selected Topics 1-3 SIExploration of a topic (to be determined) notcovered by the standard curriculum but ofinterest to faculty and students in a particularsemester. "

The purpose ofthe musical theater program is to train students in a systematic way that prepares them to compete realistically in the complex professional world ofmusical theater. Achieving this goal requires a carefully structured balance of studio and academic work. Musical theater studio work requires skills not onlyin dramatic performance, but in music and dance as well. The B.F.A. program in musical theater utilizes the resources of both the Department of Drama andthe Setnor School of Music. Students develop their skills in a structured, intensive format that features careful and expert guidance.Performance is a major focus of the 128-credit program. Students gain skills and experience in the various modes of musical theater: the revue, traditionalmusical comedies, operettas, and new and experimental forms. Coursework includes a balance of acting, voice, dance, theater history, music theory, andliberal education studies.The first year is the foundation for all future training. It focuses on techniques of acting, ballet, voice—both singing and speaking—sight-singing, musictheory, dramatic theory, and technical theater crafts. Writing is also a requirement for all musical theater majors. The first year is a non-performance year,but students are assigned to work on one production behind the scenes. They may elect to work on additional productions in a wide variety of jobs.After the first year, students may audition for all productions—musicals, dramas, films—i.e., all productions connected with the Department of Drama andSyracuse Stage. They also begin specialized training in musical theater performance, scene study, audition techniques, musical theater history, musicaltheater dance, and choreography.
