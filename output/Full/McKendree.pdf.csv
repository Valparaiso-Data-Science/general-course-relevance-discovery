First called Lebanon Seminary, the school opened in two rented sheds for 72 students. In 1830, Bishop William McKendree, the first American-born bishop of the Methodist Church, permitted the Board of Trustees to change the institution’s name to McKendree College. Later Bishop McKendree deeded 480 acres of rich land in Shiloh Valley, Illinois, to help support the College. Reverend Peter Akers, in 1833, was the first president of the newly named college. He was three times president of McKendree College and received its first degree, an honorary Doctorate of Divinity. In 1835, the College received one of the first charters granted to independent church colleges by the Illinois legislature. The institution still operates under the provisions of a second, more liberal charter obtained in 1839.The University MissionMcKendree UniversitySince 1828, McKendree University has provided a high quality undergraduate and graduate education in a friendly, nurturing environment. total enrollment is over 3,000, with a 236-acre campus in lebanon, Illinois near downtown St. Louis, a campus in Radcliff, Kentucky, and online programs.

In addition, the university provides an option for interest-free payments on a monthly basis. This option is available through Tuition 19AdmissionManagement Systems. Payment may be spread over ten months from August 1 to May 1. The enrollment fee is $85. For students who register for less than a full semester or for a single one-month session, the same minimum registration payment and requirements as set forth above will apply. In this case, however, payment of the balance is due at the beginning of the session for which the student has registered. If payment is not made by the last day of registration, the university will charge interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month from that day, and reserves the right to bar the student from classes, residence halls, the dining hall, and examinations until such payment is made. Furthermore, the university reserves the right to withhold grades or transcripts if the account is not paid in full by the end of the session for which the student has registered. The university will not allow students to participate in the graduation ceremony or have their degree posted or verified in any way until their account is paid in full. Students with delinquent accounts are responsible to reimburse the university for all interest charges, late payment fees, collection fees and court costs resulting from any delinquency. The Offices of Administration and Finance and Financial Aid will work with students in the event of problems associated with payment of financial obligations. Students anticipating a payment problem should make an appointment with the Business Office to ensure that the requirements of the payment policy are met. McKendree University reserves the right to change tuition, fees, and room and board charges at any time.Check PolicyAny check negotiated with the university which is not honored by the individual’s bank will be subject to a penalty charge. The student must make payment in cash for the unredeemed check and the penalty charge within five (5) days of receipt of a bad check from the bank by the university.Financial AidMcKendree University offers financial aid in the form of grants, scholarships, work-study, loans, or some combination of these. Aid is awarded according to each individual’s need in relation to educational costs. Specific awards include Federal Pell Grants, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Illinois Student Assistance Commission Monetary Award Program (MAP) grants, Federal Work-Study (FWS), Federal Direct Student Loans, Federal Direct PLUS Loans, and McKendree institutional scholarships. In addition, McKendree University is a Post-9/11 GI Bill Yellow Ribbon participant.Applying for Financial Aidan application for financial aid cannot be considered until a student is admitted to the university and enrolled in a degree-seeking program. To apply for all federal and state financial aid funds, an admitted student must file a Free application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) annually. This form is available online at https://fafsa.gov. When the FAFSA has been processed, the student will receive a Student Aid Report (SAR) from the Federal Processor. McKendree University (Title IV code number 001722) will receive the SAR electronically if McKendree University is listed as one of the schools on the FaFSa. once the office of Financial aid receives this information, the student will be notified of aid eligibility in a timely manner. A student may be selected for 20McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalogverification by the Federal government. This requires the student to submit additional documentation to verify the FAFSA information. The Office of Financial Aid will notify students of the required documents needed to complete the verification process. Verification must be completed before any financial aid is finalized and disbursed.GrantsFederal Pell GrantThe Federal Pell Grant is a federally funded financial aid program which usually does not have to be repaid. It is designed to help students pay for their college education. The amount of aid a student may receive from a Federal Pell Grant is based upon financial eligibility, enrollment status (full-time, three-quarter, half-time, or less than half-time), and the level of federal funding. Students apply for a Federal Pell Grant by completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) annually as discussed above under Applying for Financial Aid.Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG)The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant provides funds to students who have extreme financial need as determined by the FAFSA. FSEOG is gift aid and usually does not have to be repaid. Since funds are limited, priority is given to full-time campus students applying early who have the greatest need and receive a Federal Pell grant.ISAC Monetary Award Program (MAP)The Illinois Student Assistance Commission Monetary Award Program (MAP) provides grants to eligible Illinois residents attending Illinois colleges. Illinois residents automatically apply for the Illinois Student Assistance Commission Monetary Award Program by filing the FAFSA annually. Filing deadlines are printed on the FAFSA.LoansFederal Perkins LoanThis is a 5% interest federal student loan. Students must complete the FAFSA annually to determine eligibility. Funds are awarded based upon the financial need of the student and the availability of funds. Priority is given to full-time campus students.Federal Direct Student Loan (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)this loan is made available from the government. Students must complete the FAFSA annually to determine eligibility. Loans are only offered to those enrolled at least half-time. The interest rate will not exceed 8.25%. Contact the Office of Financial aid office for current interest rates.Federal Direct PLUS Loan This loan allows parents to borrow up to the cost of attendance less other financial aid. Students must file their FAFSA annually to determine eligibility. The interest rate will not exceed 9%. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for current interest rate.ScholarshipsAcademic Scholarships may be awarded to qualified first year students and only apply to tuition costs. Students must be enrolled full-time to receive their award. The university uses endowed and gift scholarships to help fund these awards. Any 21Admissionstudent receiving the ISAC MAP Grant as well as an Academic Scholarship may not in combination receive more than the dollar value of tuition and mandatory fees per semester. Transfer Scholarships are available for qualified students with a minimum of 30 transfer hours. Athletic Scholarships may be awarded in varying amounts to selected men and women participating in intercollegiate athletics. The individual coaches select recipients. The Bothwell Scholarship provides tuition assistance during the student’s junior and senior year for men and women preparing for various forms of Christian ministry. applications are available in the office of Financial aid. McKendree University scholarships can only be used for direct costs incurred while enrolled. Information about other outside scholarships may be obtained from the office of Financial aid.Satisfactory Academic Progress Policyaccording to the United States department of education regulations, all students applying for federal and/or state financial assistance must maintain satisfactory academic progress in his/her course of study to receive these funds. These standards stipulate, but are not limited to, maintaining acceptable grades, completing a sufficient number of credit hours per semester, and completing the first bachelor’s degree within a reasonable time frame. A student who does not meet these standards is not eligible to receive federally and/or state funded financial aid including institutional aid. All semesters of attendance are considered for satisfactory progress regardless of whether the student received aid. Adherence to these standards will be necessary for continued financial aid eligibility. Copies of McKendree University’s satisfactory academic progress policy are available in the Office of Financial Aid or online.Withdrawals and RefundsNo student who is suspended or dismissed from the university by university authorities shall be entitled to any refund of tuition, room rent or board. Any student who desires a change in course or withdrawal from one or more classes must sign and date a Change of Course form and have the form signed by the student’s Faculty advisor, the office of Financial aid and the office of administration and Finance. this form must then be returned to and be validated by the Office of Academic Records. In the case of complete withdrawal from the university, the student must fill out a withdrawal form and must have this form approved by the Provost, the student’s Faculty Advisor, the Office of Student Affairs, the Library, the Office of Financial Aid, the office of administration and Finance, and the office of academic records. the date on which such written approval is received by the Office of Academic Records determines the amount of refund. Failure by the student to obtain written approval makes the student ineligible for any refund. Withdrawing from one or more classes should be carefully considered in terms of graduation requirements as well as financial aid. Financial aid programs have varying rules, and students need to consult the Office of Financial Aid before adding or dropping courses once a term has begun, particularly courses offered in a one-month, six-week, or eight-week format. It is recommended that a student seek counsel from an academic advisor and the office of Financial aid before changing courses or withdrawing from one or more courses.22McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate CatalogTuition RefundsReturn of Title IV Funds PolicyThe Higher Education Amendments of 1998 changed substantially the way funds paid toward a student’s education are to be handled when a recipient of Title IV funds withdraws from school.

Classes are offered in the typical semester length (16 weeks) or a four, six, or eight-week accelerated format. Semester Courses (16 weeks):•   Fall semester courses begin late in august and end in mid-december•   Spring semester courses begin in mid-January and end in mid-MayAccelerated programs:•   Fall semester courses begin August 1 and end December 31, during which time five four-week terms and two eight-week terms are offered•   Spring semester courses begin January 1 and end May 31, during which time five four-week terms and two eight-week terms are offered•   Summer semester begins June 1 and ends July 31, during which time two four-week terms, one six-week term and one eight-week term are offeredAcademic HonestyIn order to benefit fully from the McKendree Experience, students must exercise integrity and honesty in all aspects of their academic work. Some examples of academic dishonesty are cheating, sabotage, duplicate submission, and plagiarism.a.  Cheating involves many forms of misrepresentation such as sharing exam answers, copying another student’s answers, presenting another’s work as one’s own, changing work which has been graded when the work is going to be reevaluated, having a stand-in take an exam, and using unauthorized examination aids.b.  Sabotage involves the destruction or deliberate inhibition of another student’s academic work or the destruction of materials relied upon by other students such as library materials, computer software and hardware, and computer files.c.  Duplicate submission means the submission of the same work in two different courses. This is not permitted except when permission has been given by the instructors in the courses involved.d.  Plagiarism consists of presenting the words or ideas of another without proper acknowledgement. This applies to direct quotations, paraphrases, or summarized ideas.The Violation and Initial ReportWhen a faculty member suspects or learns of an alleged instance of academic dishonesty on the part of a student, the faculty member will contact the student. When the faculty member confirms an incident of dishonesty, the faculty member may take any of the following steps:a.  Allow the student to resubmit the assignment or re-take the exam, test, or quiz for full credit;b.  Reduce the grade earned by the student for the specific assignment, exam, test, or quiz by whatever factor the faculty member deems appropriate;c.  Fail the student on the particular assignment, exam, test, or quiz;d.  Reduce the grade earned by the student for the course;e.  Fail the student for the course;27Academic Policiesf.  In particularly egregious cases, the faculty member may request that the Academic Integrity Committee conduct a hearing.In all confirmed cases, the faculty member must submit an Incident/Referral reporting Form via Webadvisor.EvidenceWithin two weeks of receipt of the reporting form, and on the basis of the evidence presented, the Associate Dean for Curriculum will determine the appropriate procedure for the disposition of the case and take one of the following actions:a.  Dismiss the case if there is insufficient evidence.b.  Send a disciplinary warning letter to the student if evidence of dishonesty is uncovered and it is a first offense.c.  Convene a hearing of the Academic Integrity Committee if it is a second or subsequent offense.The Academic Integrity Committee HearingThe student is contacted in writing by the Associate Dean for Curriculum. This notice will include the following:a.  Specification of charges.b.  Hearing date, time, and location.c.  rights of the accused.d.  Invitation to submit a response to the charges in writing or to attend the hearing in person (or remotely via phone or computer). If attending the hearing in person, the student must also submit the names of persons, if any, who will attend the hearing with him or her.The hearing should be presented in a forum where both parties have a fair opportunity to present whatever they contend is important. Every effort should be made to avoid an adversarial confrontation. the institution is the complaining party, not an individual professor, staff member, or student. These individuals may participate as witnesses, but they should not be cast in the role of prosecutor. Formal hearing procedures are designed to protect the student’s rights. The following rules should be observed:a.  the institution should present its case. It has the burden of demonstrating that a rule or rules have been violated. the standard of proof should be clear and convincing evidence. The other extremes – proof beyond a reasonable doubt or proof by a mere preponderance of evidence – should be avoided. One is not possible, and the other may not be fair.b.  The accused student has a right to hear all the evidence and testimony considered by the Academic Integrity Committee.c.  The accused student has a right to present evidence and testimony or to remain silent, with no inference of guilt being drawn from the silence.d.  the student has a right to assistance in the preparation and presentation of evidence and witnesses.e.  If a member of the Academic Integrity Committee is involved in the incident, he/she must recuse him/herself from the hearing process. 28McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalogf.  The Associate Dean for Curriculum will not attend the hearing or cast a vote about actions to be taken.CounselThe accused is entitled to have the assistance of counsel, who may act as an advisor, during the hearing process, but the student must represent him/herself.a.  Counsel is limited to a single individual.b.  Counsel may be any member of the McKendree University community or a legal representative. If the student invites a legal representative, the university’s legal representative also will attend the hearing.RecordsA record of the hearing must be maintained. Such a record becomes extremely important in the event of an appeal. The physical evidence should be received by the Academic Integrity Committee and kept with copies of all documents related to the hearing. The simplest way to preserve the testimony is with a tape recorder. the tape and evidence can then be passed along during the appeal process and is available for use before the appellate body.Possible Sanctions Following an Academic Integrity Committee HearingThe Academic Integrity Committee may elect to impose any of the following sanctions:a.  A disciplinary warning letter from the Associate Dean for Curriculum.b.  Administrative removal from the class with an automatic “F” grade for the class.c.  Academic probation for one full academic semester following the adjudication of the student as academically dishonest.d.  Suspension from the university for at least one full academic semester following the adjudication of the student as academically dishonest.e.  Expulsion from the university. In the event that a student does not respond to the charges nor attend the hearing in person or remotely, any of these actions can be taken without the student present. The Provost’s Office will notify the student in writing about actions taken by the Academic Integrity Committee.AppealsThe Provost will consider appeals of sanctions imposed by the Academic Integrity Committee. The student must file an appeal in the Provost’s Office within one week after the student has received formal notification of actions taken and must indicate which of the following are grounds for the appeal.a.  Questions of Fact: An appellant may appeal on questions of fact by introducing new evidence which would significantly affect the outcome of the case. Evidence which was known to the appellant at the time of the original hearing, but was withheld, shall not constitute a question of fact, nor is it to be considered on appeal.b.  Questions of Procedure: Appeals will be considered on the basis of question of procedure. the appellant must demonstrate that procedural guidelines established in this Academic Honesty Policy were breached, and that these errors affected the outcome of the case.29Academic Policiesc.  Severity of Sanction: Appeals based on the severity of the sanction shall be considered only when the penalty imposed exceeds the recommended range of sanctions for the specific violation as described in this document. the accused can request leniency in cases where it is clearly demonstrable that the imposition of a sanction is inconsistent with previous judicial practice, even though it may be within the range of acceptable action. Mere dissatisfaction with the sanction is not grounds for appeal.After the student has filed an appropriate request for an appeal, the Provost may take any of the following actions: a.  Deny the appeal,b.  Change a finding of guilt to a finding of innocence,c.  Modify the penalty,d.  Order a new hearing to be held wherein new evidence, testimony, etc. not available at the previous hearing is to be presented and is regarded as being of sufficient importance that it might alter the initial decision. appeal hearings must be recorded.The Provost will notify the student within one week of the outcome of the appeal.Subsequent ViolationsIf the student commits another violation(s) while the appeal is pending, the additional violation(s) cannot be entered into the existing appeal. the additional violation(s) must be treated as separate charge(s) from the appeal. However, previously upheld charges and sanctions in the student’s file are compiled as a record, and can be used as a basis to decide future charges and sanctions.Adding or Dropping Classes•   Students may add or drop courses according to the schedules posted by the academic records office for each semester.•   A course may not be added after one week from the first class meeting.•   Drops and adds are not effective until recorded by the Academic Records Office: –  Courses may be dropped online until the last day to add a class (5th business day of the term). –  After the last day to add a course, a form must be submitted with the required signatures.Additional Minor or Major after GraduationStudents who wish to complete the requirements for a minor or another major  after graduating from McKendree may do so and have that fact noted on their transcript if they:•   Take all additional coursework after graduation applied to the minor or major from McKendree. A graduate wishing to complete an additional minor or major must reapply as a non-degree seeking student.•   Meet the major and/or minor requirements of the catalog for the year in which the additional course work begins.McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalog30Advising McKendree places the relationship between advisors and students at the heart of the university experience, and students seek the guidance of their advisors frequently as they plan course and career choices. However, the ultimate responsibility for proper completion of all academic requirements rests with the student, not the advisor. Each student is assigned a faculty or staff advisor to provide guidance in developing a course plan that meets curriculum requirements and nurtures the student’s own interests and goals. For first-year students, this advisor may or may not be from the field of a student’s declared interest; but as a major focus develops, students are assigned a new advisor from among faculty members in the appropriate division or school. Students may also choose a particular faculty member from their division or school. A change of advisors is accomplished by completing the appropriate eform on the Office of Academic Records web page. AttendanceEach instructor has the responsibility of making clear to the students in writing what the attendance policy will be in each course. Student Absences for Official University FunctionsStudents shall be excused without penalty from class to participate in official university sanctioned student activities, including intercollegiate athletic competitions, debate meets, band and choir performances, university field trips, and other events approved by the Provost. Students are not to be excused from class to attend practices or conditioning sessions.  Faculty or staff in charge of such activities shall file with the Provost’s Office at least one week in advance, if possible, a list of students and dates they request the students to be excused from class. the Provost shall ensure that notification about approved student activities is communicated to the faculty in a timely manner. In addition, students must give satisfactory notice to their instructors prior to scheduled absences.  Students are responsible for all content and assignments missed while absent from class to attend university sanctioned student activities. Any deviation from this policy must be approved by the Provost.VA Policy on Class AttendanceAccording to the “Veterans Education and Employment Assistance Act of 1976,” veterans who are absent from a class for an excessive amount of time must be reported for non-attendance to the Veterans Administration. The veteran’s last date of attendance is determined by the instructor’s roll book.Auditing CoursesA student may elect to audit a course according to the following guidelines:•   The student must pay one-half the current tuition rate per hour;•   The student is not required to do any of the work for the course;•   The student is awarded no credit for auditing a course;•   The student will receive a grade of AU, which does not affect GPA in any way;•   A student who is eligible to receive VA benefits will receive no benefits for auditing a course.31Academic PoliciesChallenges to Academic DecisionsStudents who think that their work has been improperly evaluated or who think that they have been unfairly treated in any academic decision may use the following grievance procedures:1.   A student must first contact and hold a personal conference with the appropriate faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit involved no later than twenty-one (21) calendar days after the first class day of the next semester (at the off-campus centers, ten (10) days after grades are received) to see if the problem(s) can be resolved.2.   If the problem cannot be resolved through action 1, and if the student wishes to proceed further, he or she must submit a written explanation of the problem to the chair of the appropriate division or school, who will attempt to assist the student and the faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit in bringing the problem to a satisfactory conclusion. If the chair of the division or school is being named in the petition, the student shall proceed to step 3 of the process. This step shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days following the completion of step.3.   If the problem cannot be resolved through action 2, and if the student wishes to proceed further, he or she must submit a written petition to the Provost, who will attempt to assist the student, the faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit, and the chair of the division or school in bringing the problem to a satisfactory conclusion. This step shall be completed within fifteen (15) calendar days following completion of step 1 and/or step 2 as appropriate.4.   If the problem cannot be resolved through action 3, and if the student wishes to proceed further, he or she must submit a written petition to the Undergraduate Council through its chairperson, the associate dean for Curriculum. the student submitting the petition has a right to appear before the Committee, as does the faculty member, administrator, or decision-making unit. The Undergraduate Council will designate the time and place for the meeting. The student has the right of counsel at the hearing, including legal counsel, to act as an advisor, but the student must represent himself/herself. (An education major appealing a matter pertaining to the teacher education program may, however, be represented by legal counsel speaking on behalf of the student.) this step shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days following the completion of step 3. Records of these proceedings will be recorded as provided by the provisions stipulated in the McKendree University Student Handbook, section 2.00 Records. A simple majority vote of the Undergraduate Council will constitute a decision. The voting will be by secret ballot. The Associate Dean for Curriculum, who serves as Chairperson of the Undergraduate Council, chair of the division or school, and any member of the Undergraduate Council who is named in the petition, shall not be entitled to vote on the matter. Parties involved in the dispute may not be in attendance whenever the Undergraduate Council discusses and votes on the complaint. Within five (5) calendar days of the meeting, the parties involved in the dispute shall receive written notification of the decision of the Undergraduate Council. Within fourteen (14) calendar days from the date that the parties involved are informed of the committee’s decision, either party may appeal the committee’s decision to the President of the university. The President has the authority to rule 32McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalogin favor of the appealing party or accept the committee’s decision. However, if the President decides to rule in favor of the appealing party, the President shall schedule a meeting with the Undergraduate Council to discuss the rationale for the ruling. The appealing party may be present at this meeting. This meeting shall take place before official notification of the President’s decision is provided in writing to the parties involved. Within fourteen (14) calendar days the President shall provide the parties involved with official notification of the decision. Every effort shall be made to expedite and complete this process according to the time frames established by this policy. In all cases, students must await written response from the respective action step before proceeding to the next step.For more information about the university complaint policy  please see the website.Class and Status First Year   0 – 29.9 hours Sophomore   30 – 59.9 hours Junior    60 – 89.9 hours Senior   90 hours and above  Fall and spring terms less than half-time  0 – 5 hours Part-time   6 – 11 hours Full-time   12 – 18 hours overload   18 hours and above  Summer term less than half-time  0 – 2 hours Part-time   3 – 5 hours Full-time   6 – 12 hours overload   13 hours and aboveCredit for Prior LearningCredit is awarded for prior learning when such learning can be directly equated to specific subject areas that are regularly offered as part of the McKendree degree programs. The assessment processes described below are intended for use when students claim prior college-level learning that cannot be credited through the normal transfer process because it was not acquired in a college or university setting. These assessment processes, however, are not intended as a “credit for life experience” policy. McKendree does not award credit for life experience. Credit is given only for demonstrated, college-level learning in areas the faculty has judged appropriate as elements of a McKendree education.33Academic PoliciesCredit by standardized examination The university recognizes several nationally accepted college level achievement examinations, including:1.   Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board;2.   The College Level Examination Program (CLEP) of the Educational Testing Service;3.   The Proficiency Examination Program (PEP) of American College Testing; and4.   The Defense Activity for Nontraditional Education Support (DANTES) examinations. With the exception of Advanced Placement Examinations, McKendree University accepts the American Council on Education’s recommended scores. For most examinations, the faculty has approved the awarding of credit toward major and general education requirements, as well as elective credit. Credit for approved training programs Learning gained through military training and experience may be credited when the training experience for which the student seeks credit has been evaluated by the American Council on Education and listed in the Council’s Guide to the Evaluation of Educational Experience in the Armed Services. Similarly, learning gained through training and experience in civilian work is creditable if it is listed by the Council’s Program on non-Collegiate Sponsored Instruction (PonSI). McKendree also grants up to 32 hours of credit for successful completion of the Certified Professional Secretary examination, provided that credit awarded for this certification is not duplicated by other academic credit the student may receive for study at McKendree or elsewhere.Dean’s List and President’s ListDuring any term, students demonstrating outstanding academic achievement may qualify for the Dean’s List or President’s List; the criteria are:•   Completion of at least 12 letter-graded hours (courses taken using the Credit/no Credit option are not letter-graded)•   Achievement of the required minimum grade point average –  Minimum 3.600 for the Dean’s List –  4.000 for the President’s ListDeclaration of Major•   Students must officially declare a major area of study no later than the beginning of their Junior year; they should do so by submitting a Change of Major/Minor eform. •   Students transferring to McKendree University are advised to declare a major during their first semester so that an academic advisor within their major area of study may be assigned.•   Students wishing to change a major or minor may do so by submitting a Change of Major/Minor eform.

Failure to read university communications sent to McKendree email accounts does not absolve students from knowing and complying with the content of these communications.Family Educational Rights and PrivacyMcKendree University Notification of Rights under FERPA  for Postsecondary InstitutionsThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights are: 1.   The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the university receives a request for access.   Students should submit to the registrar, dean, or chair of the academic division or school [or appropriate official] written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected.   If the records are not maintained by the university official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2.   The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes is inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the university to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading.   They should write the university official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading.   If the university decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the university will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3.   The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. 35Academic Policies The university may disclose education records in the following circumstances:  –  to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is defined as a person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit and health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility; –  to comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena;  –  to appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency;  –  in connection with a student’s request for or receipt of financial aid, as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount, or conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid;  –  to certain officials of the U.S. department of education, the Comptroller general, to state and local educational authorities, in connection with certain state or federally supported education programs;  –  to accrediting organizations to carry out their functions;  –  to organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the university;  –  the results of an institutional disciplinary proceeding against the alleged of a crime of violence may be released to the alleged victim of that crime with respect to that crime.  –  As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education’s FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under which education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records – including Social Security Number, grades, or other private information – may be accessed without the student’s consent. First, the U.S. Comptroller general, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local education authorities (“Federal and State Authorities”) may allow access to student records and PII without the student’s consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is “principally engaged in the provision of education,” such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an education agency or institution. Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to student education records and PII without the student’s consent to researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when we object to or do not request such research. Federal and State authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security promises from the entities that they authorize to receive PII, but the authorities need not maintain direct control over such entities. In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile, permanently retain, and share without consent PII from a student’s education records, and they may track participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information about students that they obtain from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems.4.   The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA. 36McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalog The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:  Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. department of education 400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.  Washington, dC 20202-46055.   The university may disclose Directory Information without a student’s prior written consent.  The university designates the following as Directory Information:  Name      Dates of attendance Address (local and home)    Degrees and awards received Telephone Number (local and home)   Most recent educational institution attended E-mail address     Participation in activities and sports Date and place of birth    Weight and height of members of athletic teams Major field of study6.   Students may restrict the release of Directory Information, except to others as indicated in point #3 above. Requests of non-disclosure of Directory Information must be submitted annually within two weeks of the start of an academic term (fall, spring or summer) and will be valid for the remainder of the academic year (fall through summer). A non-disclosure form is available for your use from the Office of Academic Records. You may reach us by visiting the first floor of Old Main on the Lebanon Campus or by calling (618) 537-6819.For purposes of compliance with FERPA, the university considers all students independent.Foreign Language RequirementsStudents pursuing a major that requires a foreign language must complete a minimum of two semesters of a single foreign language or equivalent. Transcripts from an institution of higher learning can be used to fulfill this requirement. Tests can also be used for that purpose and must follow McKendree’s Testing Policy. Please see the McKendree website for acceptable scores on appropriate examinations (CleP, PeP, nln, aPt, IB, and danteS). If a student has earned credit for completing an AP, CLEP, or DANTES exam, the student must request an official transcript be sent to the McKendree office of academic records for evaluation purposes. Credit for exams that appear on a high school or another institution’s transcript will not be accepted. Before taking a CLEP or DANTES exam, students currently enrolled at McKendree must complete an application for transfer Credit form available via the Office of Academic Records webpage. Note that students may still be required to take a placement test at McKendree if they need additional credits in their foreign language. If a student wishes to use course-work completed before enrollment at McKendree University in order to meet part of the foreign language requirement, the requirement may be completed by taking any needed additional hours in a different foreign language if the courses taken previously are in a language not offered at McKendree. The total semester hours (or the equivalent as stated above) of the requirement would in such a case remain the same, but the stipulation that the work be in a single foreign language would be waived for such a student. College-level foreign language study showing a grade of C or better being transferred is acceptable in full or partial satisfaction of the foreign language requirement. 37Academic PoliciesGrade Changes•   No grade may be changed more than sixty (60) days after the end of the grading period in which that grade was assigned.•   A grade may be changed if, and only if, an error was made in the calculation or in the recording of that grade, or as a result of a grade challenge.•   A student has the right to challenge a grade; please see the Challenges to Academic decisions portion of this catalog.Grading SystemMcKendree University uses the following grading system: A     4 quality points per credit hr.

Courses for zero (0) or one (1) hour of credit are exempt from the three course limit. •   application for the Credit/no Credit grading option must be made prior to the last day of the add period and is irrevocable.Incomplete Grades:•   A student who will not complete course requirements by the end of the semester may request a grade of Incomplete from the instructor prior to the final examination. 38McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate CatalogInstructors are not required to approve any incomplete grade request, but may do so based on the following criteria:1.   The student should have completed at least 75% of the coursework for the class. 2.   The student must be able to complete the course without re-attending the class; he/she may not sit in the class the following semester in order to complete the work.•   a student receiving an incomplete has until the end of the next semester (spring or fall), or until an earlier date specified by the instructor to the student in writing, to finish the required work and to have a grade assigned.•   If no grade is assigned at the end of the next semester, the incomplete will revert to a grade of F.•   Any student with an incomplete who has applied for graduation will have one month from the date of graduation to complete the course requirements and receive a grade. If an extension is required, the date of graduation will be changed to the next date of graduation.•   The final decision to grant an incomplete grade rests with the instructor.W Grade:•   A student who officially withdraws from a course after the fifth day of classes and before the last date to drop receives a grade of W. To officially withdraw, a student must complete an Add/Drop form, obtain the necessary signatures and take/send the form to the academic records office for processing.•   a grade of W is not included in computation of the grade point average. WW Grade:A grade of WW indicates the student did not officially withdraw from the course and the grade is included in the computation of the grade point average; it affects the GPA the same as a grade of F. A grade of WW should be assigned when:1.   A student has attended or participated in at least one class session; and2.   at some point in the course, the student stops attending a face-to-face course or participating in an online course but no official withdrawal form has been submitted.If a student has attended or participated in at least one class session and misses two consecutive class sessions without notifying the instructor, the instructor should:1.   Submit an early alert via the Incident/Referral Reporting form; and2.   note the last date the student attended or participated in class.Graduation Dates•   McKendree University officially confers degrees three times a year: –  May 31 –  July 31 –  december 31•   Although a student may complete requirements for a degree prior to those dates, the degree will not be posted to the student’s academic record until the actual graduation date.•   Diplomas will be mailed after the degree is posted, providing the student has no outstanding financial obligations to the university.•   Participation in the Commencement Ceremony is not a guarantee of graduation. 39Academic PoliciesDegrees for May graduates are conferred on May 31 and for July graduates are conferred on July 31 provided all requirements for the degree are met.Honors at GraduationStudents graduating from McKendree University may be awarded Latin honors; the criteria are:•   Completion of 60 or more letter-graded hours at McKendree  (courses taken using the Credit/no Credit option are not letter-graded) and•   Achievement of the required minimum cumulative grade point average –  3.600 for cum laude –  3.750 for magna cum laude –  3.950 for summa cum laudeIllinois Articulation Initiative (IAI)McKendree University is a participant in the Illinois Articulation Initiative (IAI), a statewide agreement that allows transfer of the completed general education curriculum between participating institutions. Completion of the general education curriculum at any participating college or university in Illinois assures transferring students that general education requirements for an associate or bachelor’s degree have been satisfied. This agreement is in effect for students entering an associate or baccalaureate degree-granting institution as a first-time student in summer 1998 and thereafter. Students should be aware that individual colleges have specific courses within general classifications needed for satisfying requirements for graduation. In keeping with the McKendree University mission and its status as a liberal arts college, these requirements are the following: Literature (3 hours), Computer Literacy (3 hours), Philosophy or Religion (3 hours), Cross Cultural Studies (3 hours), and History (3 hours). Students must also take two writing intensive (W) courses.  Additionally, while McKendree will accept grades of D in transfer provided the student has completed the IAI core, certain majors require a grade of C or better. Courses that may fulfill a general education requirement under the IAI agreement will not satisfy the major requirement if a grade of D is earned and the student is pursuing those majors. McKendree University strongly recommends that students use its general education curriculum as a guide when selecting courses in social science and fine arts. (See the general education curriculum requirements in this catalog.) Students seeking licensure in education should see state requirements listed under Education in this catalog. Please contact the Kentucky campus for information about Kentucky Articulation agreements. Independent and Directed StudyIndependent Study:•   In order to enroll for independent study, a student must have completed 15 credit hours of study in the subject area and have an overall cumulative GPA and subject area gPa of 3.0.•   Outstanding underclassmen who may wish to pursue independent study must apply through their faculty advisor, the faculty mentor of the study, and the division or school chairperson.40McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalog•   In addition to the forms required for registration in independent study, an application form which will state the nature of the project for reading, a tentative outline, and bibliography will be required.•   The request form must be submitted at the time of registration.•   The approval of the faculty advisor, faculty mentor of the study, the division or school chairperson, and the Provost is required.•   No more than nine hours may be taken in independent study.•   A rather extensive research paper or its equivalent will be required for independent study.•   Students enrolled in independent study must meet with the faculty on a regular basis for a discussion of their study.Directed Study:•   Directed Study is an option by which students can petition a qualified instructor to teach a standing course that is not offered in the schedule of classes in the current semester.•   Such an option is intended to be used very sparingly and only in cases of a dire need to graduate on time, and every effort should be made by advisors to place students into the courses they need when they are offered.•   A student may not opt for more than one Directed Study (up to 4 hours) to count toward graduation.•   Directed Studies require the approval of the faculty member offering the course, the chair of the division or school in which the course is housed, and the Provost.Individually Designed Majors A student may elect to participate in planning those courses which shall constitute his or her major field of concentration. The selection of these courses would reflect the student’s educational and vocational objectives. It will be guided by the following policy.1.   A student who feels that his or her goals can be more adequately served through an individually designed major rather than one of the standing majors will request his/her academic advisor to assist in the planning of that major.2.   The student, in consultation with the academic advisor and the Provost, will select another professor who will also assist in the planning of that major. At least one of the academic advisors must be from the core subject area.3.   Once the major has been planned by the student and academic advisors, the Provost and the academic advisors will meet as a group to grant or deny approval to the tentative program.4.   The major will constitute a total of not fewer than 40 hours with a core of 24 hours in a given subject area. At least 50% of the coursework applied to the major must be taken at McKendree University.5.   The proposal of what constitutes the major must be submitted for final approval to the Provost not later than one year prior to anticipated graduation. Any amendments or changes in the proposal must have the approval of the academic advisors and the Provost.6.   although students are encouraged to complete the procedures outlined above as early in the university career as possible, the individually designed major must be submitted prior to the accumulation of 92 hours either in residence or transfer.41Academic PoliciesInternshipsThe internship program links academic life to the challenges of the world of work. The internship experience complements traditional coursework by providing students the opportunity to apply classroom theory and knowledge in the work environment.Through the Office of Career Services, students may begin the internship process if they meet the following criteria: •   have junior level status (60 credit hours)•   have completed at least 12 credit hours in the major•   currently hold a minimum overall GPA of 2.0•   have a major GPA consistent with graduation requirements•   and not have been on academic probation in the last academic yearStudents must work a total of 45 hours per credit hour during the semester and complete required assignments for each credit hour granted. Student interns work with the close supervision of faculty members, on-site supervisors, and Career Services. Internship credit applied to a major or minor may not exceed the equivalent of one course (three to four semester hours).Interruption of Studies If a student interrupts attendance at McKendree University for a period equaling or exceeding three consecutive calendar years, the student must re-enroll under the provisions of the catalog which is current at the time of his or her re-enrollment.Students reentering McKendree after an absence of ten or more years may elect one of the following options:1.   Treat all previous course work as transfer credit and retain only those courses with grades of C or better. The previous grade point average would not then be considered in determining academic standing.2.   Retain all previous course work along with the grade point average. The repeat/delete option may be used to improve the grade point average.Maximum Course Load•   18 credit hours is the maximum course load for the Fall and Spring terms.•   12 credit hours is the maximum course load for the Summer term.•   Students may not register for more than the maximum course load without the written permission of his or her academic advisor.•   Students may not register for more than 22 credit hours unless he or she obtains approval from the Provost or, in Kentucky, from the Executive Director of the Kentucky Campuses.•   Undergraduate students attending the Lebanon campus may take only one online course per semester.•   For F-1 students enrolled in classes for credit or classroom hours, no more than the equivalent of one class or three credits per session, term, semester, trimester, or quarter may be counted toward the full course of study requirement if the class is taken online or through distance education and does not require the student’s physical attendance for classes, examination or other purposes integral to 42McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalogcompletion of the class. an online or distance education course is a course that is offered principally through the use of television, audio, or computer transmission including open broadcast, closed circuit, cable, microwave, or satellite, audio conferencing, or computer conferencing. If the F-1 student’s course of study is in a language study program, no online or distance education classes may be considered to count toward a student’s full course of study requirement.Permission to RegisterStudents may register for subsequent terms during regular registration periods provided they have done the following:•   Completed their admission file, including obtaining final, official copies of transcripts from their high school, any other institutions they have attended, and aP and CleP scores.•   Submitted a medical examination form and proof of required vaccinations.•   Paid their account balance or made arrangements with the Business Office to do so.•   Met and discussed future coursework with their academic advisor.•   Met the conditions of any other registration hold on their account.Probation, Suspension, DismissalA student may be placed on probation, suspended, or dismissed from the university for either academic or non-academic reasons.ProbationThe measure of the student’s academic performance will be reported to the Provost upon the completion of the Fall and Spring Semesters.A student will be placed on academic probation when he or she fails to meet the minimum academic standards stated in the following schedule: 12 – 27.9 credit hours attempted  1.75 cumulative grade point average 28 – 59.9 credit hours attempted  1.9 cumulative grade point average 60 – 91.9 credit hours attempted  2.0 cumulative grade point average 92 or above cr. hrs. attempted  2.0 cumulative grade point average•   No student will be placed on probation who has attempted fewer than 12 hours at McKendree University.•   Any student whose semester grade point average for one reporting period is less than 1.0 may be subject to review and to action by the Academic Standing Committee.•   Students will be notified of their probationary status by letter.•   During the probationary term a maximum course load of 15 hours may be attempted.•   Probationary and conditionally admitted students are required to enroll for a study skills class or participate in other programs of the Student Success Center.43Academic PoliciesSuspension•   A student will be placed on academic suspension if he or she fails to meet a minimum semester GPA of 2.0 while on probation.•   Suspensions may not be served during the Summer Term.•   Students will be notified of their suspension status by letter.•   Students may appeal their suspension by submitting a letter to the Provost by the date indicated in the suspension letter.Dismissal•   Students will be notified of their dismissal status by letter.Repeat/DeleteA course taken at McKendree University may be repeated at McKendree University. No course may be taken under the repeat/delete provisions except at McKendree University. Refer to the section on financial aid for impact on level of aid received when repeating courses in which a passing grade was recorded.The following conditions apply:1.   A student may repeat any course one time (unless the course is deemed not repeatable by the department).2.   A student may repeat a course twice only if the student failed the course (F) both times it was taken before.3.   All grades will appear on the permanent record.4.   For the purpose of computing grade point average and total hours earned, the student taking a repeat/delete will be credited with the highest grade earned for all attempts.5.   If a course has dropped in credit level (for instance from 4 to 3 hours), the residue credit not covered by the repeat will be reflected on the transcript at the grade originally awarded and will be computed in the grade point average, unless extended credit is earned and awarded.Research Institutional Review BoardThe Institutional Review Board (IRB) at McKendree University has been established to review research involving human participants in order to assure adequate safeguards for those who voluntarily choose to engage in research projects. Any faculty members or students who conduct research using human participants should consult the IRB website for more information on the ethical use of human participants and applying for IRB approval.Residence Requirement degree-seeking students must earn their final 30 hours in residence (at McKendree University). Hours earned in study abroad programs, courses approved by consortial or other institutional agreements, and approved dual-degree program courses are considered to be taken in residence. All upper-division hours required for the major and minor should be earned in residence. Students wishing to take general education, general elective, or lower level major and minor courses out of residence must complete an application for transfer Credit eForm prior to taking those courses.44McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate CatalogRestrictions on Enrollment McKendree University reserves the right to restrict enrollment in classes designed for certain academic populations to members of those populations. Undergraduate students attending the Lebanon campus may take only one online course per semester.Second Degree Students seeking two baccalaureate degrees during  a single period of attendance at McKendree University must:•   Complete all the requirements of each degree and •   Accumulate an additional 30 McKendree University credits beyond the work taken to earn one degree (a minimum of 150 total credit hours).Students who have earned baccalaureate or master’s degree(s) from any other regionally accredited institution of higher education may earn another baccalaureate degree from McKendree University; the student must:•   Complete all general education curriculum and major requirements in effect  at the time of matriculation.•   earn a minimum of 30 hours at McKendree.Severe Weather Policy•   Under severe weather conditions, university officials will announce whether the university is open, closed, or on a snow schedule.•   Announcements for the Lebanon Campus will be posted on the McKendree website, KMOX radio (1120 AM), and KMOV television (Ch. 4).45Academic PoliciesSnow schedule:•   lebanon classes beginning at 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. are canceled.•   9:30 a.m. classes will begin at 10:00 a.m.•   Normal class schedule resumes beginning with 10:00 a.m. classes.•   all offices open at 10:00 a.m.•    For severe weather schedules at off-campus sites,  if the site is open, then classes will be held.Transfer of CreditThe general criteria by which McKendree University evaluates transfer courses presented for degree credit at McKendree are: (1) the educational quality of the sending institution and of the courses themselves; (2) the comparability of the credit and of the courses themselves to be transferred to McKendree; and (3) the appropriateness and applicability of the courses and credits in relation to programs offered at McKendree University. In general, McKendree University accepts transfer courses from regionally accredited institutions provided that these courses are intended to meet degree requirements at the sending institution. In cases where the quality, comparability, or applicability of a course is in question, before rendering a decision on granting transfer credit, the University reserves the right to request additional information (see next paragraph). In cases where a student presents transfer work from institutions lacking regional accreditation the University requires the student to present convincing documentation about the quality, comparability, and applicability of the course(s) in question (see next paragraph). The “additional information” or “convincing documentation” requested or required may include such items as a course syllabus, credentials of the faculty member, and/or a portfolio of work completed for the course. In evaluating the quality and comparability of a course applicable to a McKendree degree, factors such as the following will be considered: comparability of expected student outcomes for the course, evidence of comparable rigor, and the nature of the course experiences (e.g., reading, writing, and research requirements, laboratories, hands-on work, physical education activities).All transfer credits must meet the following criteria:1.   The student must have earned a grade equivalent to C or better (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) in every course requested for transfer. Courses taken pass/fail are not accepted in transfer. McKendree University does not give credit for life experience. 2.   Credit may be awarded for prior learning (please see Credit for Prior Learning section of this catalog).3.   No more than 90 credit hours will be accepted toward a degree from any combination of transfer credit (junior and community colleges and four-year institutions) and prior learning assessment. (CleP, PeP, nln, aPt, IB, and danteS examination programs; and ACE-approved training programs, military or civilian). No more than 36 hours will be accepted from examination programs (CLEP, PEP, nln, aPt, IB, and danteS).4.   Please see the McKendree website for acceptable scores for examination programs (CleP, PeP, nln, aPt, IB, and danteS).46McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalog5.   Following matriculation, students are expected to take their coursework at McKendree. a student desiring to take a course at another institution for transfer to McKendree must request to do so by completing the appropriate eform supplied by the Office of Academic Records. If the request is approved, the course may be transferred to McKendree within the limits of the university’s normal transfer policies (see 1–4 above).6.   All types of transfer credit earned more than 10 years prior to matriculation at McKendree University will be subject to divisional or school evaluation to determine acceptability.7.   a student must complete 60 letter-graded hours at McKendree to be considered for latin honors at graduation.8.   All postsecondary transcripts from international institutions (excluding institutions with which McKendree has an established study abroad program) must be evaluated by a credential evaluation agency. Please contact Educational Credential evaluators, Inc. at www.ece.org or (414) 289-3400 or World educational Services at www.wes.org or (800) 937-3895 for more information.

ENG 490,")n    Foreign Language: Two semesters of college-level foreign language.Mission: The mission of the English program is to offer a wide range of courses in literature and writing to prepare students for graduate study and careers in teaching and other professions. Description of Major: In an increasingly information-based economy, McKendree University’s English faculty teach students, both through its general education requirements and its English major, to read closely, think critically, and write well. As students pursue an English major, they develop a better understanding of the cultural, historical, ethical, aesthetic, and linguistic dimensions that shape all of us. Students refine their analytical and research skills as they learn to write with clarity, coherence, creativity, and precision. As the English major progresses from introductory surveys to its capstone course, students complete increasingly more challenging assignments and perform more in-depth analysis of literary texts and genres.  through class discussions, lectures, events and student groups such as Sigma tau Delta and the Literary Interest Society, the English department faculty and students strive to create and nourish a rich intellectual environment. In addition, publications such as the McKendree Review and Montage offer venues for students to publish their work. To major in English a student must complete at least 24 credit hours of English courses at McKendree. At least 21 hours of the English major (literature and writing track) must be taken from courses numbered 300 or above.  In addition to the courses required for the English/secondary education track, it is also recommended that students in secondary education take one or more journalism courses. In addition, it is recommended that secondary education English majors with an interest in teaching drama and theatre take Dramatic Literature and/or any theatre (THE) course as electives as well as participate in the university’s theatre productions. General education and professional education requirements must also be met for licensure. These are listed in the section titled “Initial Secondary License” in the courses of study section of this catalog under Education.83Courses of Study Students who are considering graduate school in English should make an effort to take as many of the following courses as possible:  SEMINAR IN ENGLISH (W) (4) SEMINAR IN ENGLISH (W) (4) SEMINAR IN ENGLISH (W) (4) FOREIGN LANGUAGE (6)85Courses of StudyONE COURSE FROM THE FOLLOWI SEMINAR IN ENGLISH (W) (4)Research approaches, resources and methods in literature and criticism are taught in connection with a selected topic.

Law schools require applicants to complete a standardized test, the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT). Logic and other courses that emphasize critical thinking will help performance on the lSat. The Legal Studies minor complements many majors. This minor benefits students in their future careers, graduate school aspirations, and personal development.

(12)115Courses of StudyPhysics (PHY)Within the Division of Science and Mathematics, we seek to provide a broad-based education that prepares graduates to be scientifically and mathematically literate, socially responsible, and professionally successful.Within the program in physics, we have established the following goals for our graduates:•   Content: Graduates should have a broad-based understanding of core physical science concepts as well as an understanding of concepts and techniques specific to their specialization.•   Practice: graduates should be able to formulate and solve problems relevant to their area of specialization.•   Communication: Graduates should be able to access existing physical science knowledge and effectively communicate their own work to a broader community.•   Professional Awareness: graduates should develop personal and professional goals, the tools to achieve these goals, and an understanding of professional responsibilities.The foundations of physics can be traced back to the ancient Greeks (600–200 BC), who sought order within the physical events that were understood as either chaotic or mystical. The idea of atoms as the fundamental particles of matter had a major influence over much of the scientific investigation that occurred over the course of the next few millennia. The laws of physics apply from the subatomic through the cosmic levels, an idea whose development can be traced through the history of the science. The contributions of Democritus, Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Faraday, Maxwell, Planck, Curie, Hubble, Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Feynman, Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley provide insights to pivotal moments in our field. The physics of today is based upon the achievements of the past. Students should appreciate the significance of these accomplishments and teachers should foster this appreciation. The Engineering Physics minor was designed to prepare students for study in mechanical, civil, or electrical engineering. the curriculum develops a strong foundation of mathematical analysis, scientific inquiry, and engineering design, to pose questions, seek answers, and develop solutions to complex problems.To obtain a minor in engineering physics,  the student must complete the following courses.ENGINEERING PHYSICS MINOR REQUIREMENTS 20 crs.

Philosophy addresses the “big questions,” including: What is the meaning of life? What duties do we have to others? What makes a society or law just? Is faith compatible with reason? What is the relation of mind to brain? As the oldest and most basic of the liberal arts disciplines, philosophy provides a foundation for addressing such questions, but also cultivates skills in reasoning and argumentation that are critical to graduate studies, law school, employment, and, indeed, to being an informed and engaged citizen. Majoring in philosophy allows students to develop familiarity with a basic intellectual vocabulary through which discussion of central questions has occurred, as well as an ability to recognize relationships between past philosophies and basic presuppositions of Western culture today. Philosophy also seeks to develop students’ ability to recognize philosophical issues and to assess critically the response of various thinkers to those issues, while developing empathic skills in entering the “mind set” of given thinkers. Majors will emerge with the tools for diagnosing their own intellectual presuppositions and those of their culture, thus moving them to develop and express their own careful thinking about central philosophical questions.Student Learning OutcomesStudents will:•   Develop the interpretive, critical, and argumentative skills necessary for academic excellence, career success, and civil engagement.•   Know the major figures, issues, and debates in the history of Western philosophy, both ancient and modern.•   Explain, analyze, and evaluate the ethical and social issues that inform our personal and social lives.•   Create a perspective from which students can synthesize all their studies and develop a sense of how philosophy bears on other disciplines.Degree Preparation: The study of philosophy develops skills essential to success in future education and employment, including: critical thinking, evaluation and construction of sophisticated arguments, consideration of many different College of  Arts and Sciences114McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate Catalogperspectives on a single subject, clear written communication on complex topics, and the ability to synthesize and organize complex information. Students majoring in philosophy often enter the fields of law, medicine, journalism, or business, in addition to pursuing graduate studies in philosophy itself. A major or minor in philosophy, in tandem with a major in a narrower professional field or other academic discipline, will serve the student well as career advancement comes to require flexibility of mind, and insight into the essentials of a situation, as well as analytical skills. It is suggested that the student consider a major or minor in a second field. The following courses, many of which also fulfill core curriculum requirements, are suggested but not required for the major in philosophy: )n    Service: Public Relations Techniques (W) (  COMMUNICATION RESEARCH METHODS (3)  COMMUNICATION RESEARCH METHODS (3)THREE COURSES FROM THE FOLLOWING 9 crs.)n    Service: Small Group Communication ( COMMUNICATION RESEARCH METHODS (3) FOREIGN LANGUAGE (6) ADDITIONAL SPEECH ELECTIVES (12)College of  Arts and Sciences136McKendree University 2018/2019 Undergraduate CatalogSPEECH COMMUNICATION MINOR REQUIREMENTS 18 crs.

SPC 351,")Mission: The organizational communication program at McKendree University provides students with the opportunity to gain the understanding, skills, and experience necessary to engage in professional communication in organizational contexts.Description of Major: The major blends the traditional disciplines of business and speech communication to meet contemporary organizational communication needs. In its exploration of the interrelationship between organizations and communication, organizational communication represents one of the most rapidly expanding fields of study in the twenty-first century. Experience in the classroom is broadened by an internship program that is designed to give “on-the-job” training. The major consists of a core and a sequence of courses emphasizing marketing, management, professional communication, or human resources, and three elective courses. At least 24 credits for the major must be earned at McKendree University. 111Courses of StudyStudent Learning OutcomesStudents will:•   develop and deliver professional presentations.•   Create contextually appropriate messages.•   Critically analyze messages.•   Employ communication theories, perspectives, principles, and concepts.•   Demonstrate the ability to accomplish communicative goals.•   Apply ethical communication principles in order to embrace diversity, influence public discourse, and engage in organizational leadership.Degree Preparation: One of the most widely sought skills in organizations today is the ability to communicate effectively. Meeting the communication challenges of organizations requires an understanding of an expanded body of knowledge related to individual behaviors, group behaviors, and the organizational context within which these behaviors occur. Research reveals mastery of communication skills contributes to successful job performance. Students will develop a theoretical base on which to build problem-solving, organizational strategies, listening, rhetorical sensitivity, confidence, and presentation skills.CORE COURSES 33 crs.

Applied sport psychology professionals are interested in how participation in sport, exercise, and physical activity may enhance personal development and well-being throughout the life span (information from the Association for Applied Sport Psychology website – AASP).  Although there are many specific concepts within applied sport psychology (e.g., stress management, teamwork, goal setting, concentration, relaxation, imagery), the general goal is to teach athletes the mental skills necessary to perform consistently in training and competition and to help them realize their potential as people and athletes. Sport psychology draws upon the following areas of research: health psychology, performance enhancement and intervention, and social psychology. Sport psychology is a growing field as a number of elite, amateur, and professional athletes are currently working with applied sport psychology professionals. Coaches also seek sport psychology professionals to work with their teams.  The sport psychology minor would be beneficial to students interested in occupations such as exercise specialists, athletic trainers, youth sport directors, or coaching. Moreover, students interested in pursuing graduate study in psychology, education, physical education, or occupational therapy could benefit from this minor.  The sport psychology minor emphasizes current theoretical and applied research in the fast growing field of sport psychology. The courses are a combination of primarily psychology and physical education courses. Please note that some of the courses have prerequisites. For a course to be accepted toward a sport psychology minor, a grade of C- or better is required.To minor in Sport Psychology:1.   Students must complete 20 credit hours and earn a minimum cumulative gPa of 2.25 in courses applied to the minor.2.   at least nine hours must be at the upper division level.3.

McKendree students who do not participate in the four-year option or community college transfer students are eligible for enrollment. Basic prerequisites for the two-year option are as follows: a.  Students must be in good academic standing (minimum 2.0 gPa) and pass an Army medical examination. b.  Students must have two academic years of study remaining (undergraduate or graduate). Undergraduate students must have junior status. Students attend a six-week summer camp to obtain the knowledge acquired by students in the four-year option.
