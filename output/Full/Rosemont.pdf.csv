Rosemont College seeks to develop in all members of the community open and critical minds, the ability to make reasoned, moral decisions and a sense of responsibility to serve others in our global society.  Rooted in Catholicism, Rosemont College welcomes all faiths and is guided by the educational principles of Cornelia Connelly and the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, to meet the needs of the time.  Rosemont College values:  Trust in and reverence for the dignity of each person; Diversity with a commitment to building an international community; Persistence and courage in promoting justice with compassion; Care for the Earth as our common home.  ROSEMONT ROOTS Rosemont College was founded in 1921 by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus on the Sinnott estate in Rosemont, Pennsylvania.  From those early days until the present, the spirit of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus has been an integral part of the growth of the College.  Holy Child education is both a clearly defined and flexible ideal.  It is a tradition rooted in Christian values and expressions and attuned to learning opportunities that enable students to respond to life with joy, zeal, and compassion.  Rosemont College encourages students to meet diversity and change with confidence in their own gifts and in God, who has made a covenant with the human family. Each year a mission theme is taken from the mission statement which the College explores and incorporates its meaning on campus and beyond in its activities and events.  In the nineteenth century, Cornelia Connelly, an American convert to Catholicism, founded the Society of the Holy Child Jesus and opened her first school in England.  Cornelia’s Society was grounded in the Incarnation: in becoming one of us, God conferred dignity on humankind.  Thus, Cornelia reasoned simply, each person is worthy of respect and reverence.  Cornelia Connelly, founder of the sponsoring congregation, has been the force behind Rosemont’s mission to educate women and men “to meet the wants of the age.”  Rosemont is authorized by The Pennsylvania Commonwealth Charter to grant degrees in Arts, Science, and Letters.  Today Rosemont is one college with three distinct schools: the traditional Undergraduate College, and the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies, which include Rosemont College Online.  The College is accredited by the Middle States Association of Schools and Colleges. On May 30, 2008 the Board of Trustees of Rosemont College approved a Strategic Plan to expand the College’s enrollment, programs, and reputation by embracing co-education, partnerships, and online education. As a result, the College opened its doors at the undergraduate level to all interested and qualified women and men in the fall of 2009, unifying the College’s three schools and expanding the College’s mission of being a ‘community of learners’.   The traditional Undergraduate College grants the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Fine Arts degrees.  The traditional Undergraduate College also provides students the opportunity to participate in study abroad programs, service learning, research opportunities, internships, and special programs in pre-law and pre-medicine.  The School of Graduate Studies, established in 1986, and the School of Professional Studies, established in 1994, contribute to the mission of Rosemont College by providing undergraduate and graduate degree programs designed to accommodate the school’s diverse population of adult learners. Innovative teaching, flexible scheduling, online courses, advanced curriculum, and collaborative learning in an accelerated format, as well as recognition of prior life experience, are hallmarks of Rosemont College’s Graduate and Professional Studies programs.  The Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies offer undergraduate professional studies degrees, master’s degrees, and certificates.  ROSEMONT COLLEGE 9  The Office of Non-Credit Programs offers a wide range of topics and formats for lifelong learners through the Forum. Courses examine art, religion, history, literature, and much more. Our instructors include current and retired Rosemont College faculty, as well as scholars and experts from the greater Philadelphia community.  For complete and updated information about the programs and policies at Rosemont College please visit the college web site at www.rosemont.edu.  THE LIBERAL ARTS CURRICULUM Rosemont’s liberal arts curriculum provides the student with a breadth of knowledge that makes evident the connections between often compartmentalized fields, while simultaneously providing a solid base for advanced study in a particular discipline. The curriculum instills in the student the habits of observation and precision while enabling him/her to formulate and express thoughts clearly and effectively, both orally and in writing.  This in turn develops in our students the ability to reason, both inductively and deductively, and to think with the creativity – that is, the freedom – needed to find innovative solutions to problems.  Learning and the study of ideas take place in an atmosphere inspired by the Christian conviction that human beings need to grow, not in isolation, but in relation to God, the universe, and other human beings.  Therefore, the student is constantly presented with challenges in the hope of inspiring the development of aesthetic, ethical, and religious values.    Learning to see themselves in relation to the universe grants our students a healthy sense of perspective, and a strong sense of self, an indomitability that will allow them to follow their aspirations and to make a difference in the world.  ACCREDITATION All degree programs at Rosemont College are registered by the Pennsylvania State Department of Education. Rosemont College has been regionally accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education.  STATE AUTHORIZATION FOR ONLINE PROGRAMS Rosemont College monitors developments in state laws in every state. If authorization or licensure is necessary or becomes necessary, Rosemont College will obtain the required additional approvals. Rosemont College is currently authorized, licensed, exempt, or not subject to approval in AL, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, DC, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MO, NV, NH, NJ, NM, NY, NC, ND, OH, OK, PA, RI, SC, TN, TX, VT, VA. Exemptions and authorizations for states not listed are currently in progress.  We the faculty, staff, and administration of Rosemont College consider service to students as our most sacred obligation. This dedication is rooted in the college's mission and gives embodiment to our belief in the dignity of all individuals, regardless of their origins or faith.  We strive for excellence, not only in our academic programs but in the quality of the services we provide to our students. Part of this commitment requires us to examine what we do on a continual basis. The coordination of that task is entrusted to the college-wide Assessment Committee, comprised of members of all college constituencies. Its job is to gather, disseminate, and promote the use of information across the campus. Academic outcomes assessment, institutional effectiveness, and general research all are tasks of this group.

Through intellectual rigor, social and spiritual offerings, and leadership opportunities offered to students in an individualized, personal environment, the Undergraduate College seeks to develop in its students the strengths and abilities required to respond to the needs and challenges of the times.  ADMISSION AND APPLICATION PROCEDURES Rosemont College seeks to enroll students who desire an undergraduate liberal arts education, who have the capacity to pursue a strong academic program, and who show promise of contributing to the College community.  Students are considered for admission without regard to race, religion, disability, ethnicity, or national origin.  Students may seek admission as either first year or transfer students.  Rosemont operates on a rolling admissions policy and meetings of the Admissions Committee are held regularly throughout the academic year.  Applicants receive notification of the Committee’s decision within one month of receipt of their completed application. Test-Optional Policy Rosemont College is committed to providing a path for talented and motivated students whose potential for academic success is not accurately captured by standardized test scores.    Applicants to Rosemont College now have the option of submitting the SAT or ACT standardized test score or choosing to apply test-optional.  Students who choose to apply test-optional must have a cumulative weighted HSGPA of 3.0 or higher (on a 4.0 scale). An interview is also required (on-campus, Skype or Facetime). Students who are interested in the Honors program may also apply test-optional.   Students who are homeschooled or International students cannot apply test-optional (see requirements further in catalogue) and will be required to submit test scores.   Students who choose to submit the SAT or ACT will need to submit official scores to Rosemont. We do not accept student score reports.   The SAT code number for Rosemont College is 2763; the ACT code number is 3676.  Students from Puerto Rico may submit scores from the Proeba Aptitude Academia (PAA) in place of the SAT.  Students whose first language is not English should submit results from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS). A score of at least 500 written, 173 computer based or 71 on the Internet version is required for the TOEFL exam and a score of 6 for the UC and 6.5 for Graduate Studies is required for the IELTS.  Rosemont’s TOEFL code is 2763.     FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS   Students applying to Rosemont from high school, or as high school graduates, are automatically considered for three things; admission, merit based scholarships and the Honors program. There are no separate applications required. Students are required to submit:   A completed application;  An official copy of SAT or ACT test scores; or Interview if applying test-optional  Essay;  An official copy of the high school transcript; Letters of recommendation are optional, but strongly encouraged (no more than 3).  Students with a cumulative weighted HSGPA of 3.0 (on 4.0 scale) and under a combined SAT score of 900 or ACT of 16, will be required to interview.  Once applicants make the selection  to be test-optional or to submit scores, it cannot be changed or reversed.     UNDERGRADUATE COLLEGE 16  An applicant’s secondary school preparation should ordinarily include twelve units of college preparatory courses. All applicants are advised to include in their high school programs a minimum of four years of English, two years of a foreign language, two years of social studies, two years of laboratory science, and two years of college preparatory mathematics.    HOMESCHOOLED STUDENTS   Rosemont College welcomes homeschooled students.  Homeschooled students have found, as Rosemont students do, that a personalized environment is most conducive to growing and learning. We believe that homeschoolers have demonstrated that the student possess self-discipline and a mature commitment to education. As such, these students find Rosemont, with its small class sizes, personal attention, and faith-based community, to be an ideal atmosphere in which to continue their life-long pursuit of knowledge.  Homeschoolers applying to Rosemont are required to submit:  A completed application;  Essay  Letter of Recommendation  Official SAT or ACT scores;  A transcript, formal log, portfolio, or written description of studies undertaken during the student’s four years of secondary education.  Students are strongly encouraged to include their evaluator’s reports, if applicable. TRANSFER STUDENTS     Rosemont College welcomes transfer students from accredited institutions. Transfer candidates may seek entrance in either the fall or the spring semester. Transfer applications are complete when the following credentials have been received:  A completed application;  Official transcript(s) from all previous college(s) attended including current college if applicable;  Essay  An official high school transcript(s) or GED certificate if  the student has earned less than 30 transferrable credits. To have credits considered for transfer, the student must submit an official transcript from an accredited post-secondary institution (approved list on file with the Registrar’s Office) or ACE approved training program or official score reports from a nationally recognized standardized exam.  The College will determine the acceptability of credits and reserves the right to determine whether transfer credits are applied to general education requirements, requirements within the major or elective credits.  Transfer credit will be awarded only for courses in which the student earned a grade of C (2.0) or better.  Pass/fail courses and developmental courses are not eligible for transfer.  Courses completed at an institution utilizing a quarterly academic calendar will be accepted on a prorated scale.  Standardized exams will be accepted as transfer credit provided the student has earned the ACE recommended minimum score or the minimum score established at the College.  Students enrolled in an undergraduate program of study are required to complete a minimum of 120 credits (3 credit courses).  At least half the credits for the major must be taken at Rosemont.  Transcripts that are 10 years or older will not be eligible for transfer credits.  Transferring From A Two-Year Institution  Students transferring from a two-year institution (community college or junior college) may transfer up to a maximum of 66 credits required for a baccalaureate degree into their undergraduate program of study at Rosemont College.    Transfer of Associate Degrees    Rosemont College accepts associate degrees from accredited post-secondary institutions (approved list on file with the Registrar’s Office).  Students transferring with an associate degree who have earned at least 60 credits will be granted junior status and will be permitted to transfer any additional coursework up to a maximum of 66 credits.  For students transferring with an associate degree from an institution which holds a current articulation agreement with Rosemont College, that agreement will be honored in assigning credits.  Transfer credit will be awarded for courses earned toward the associate degree in which the student earned a grade of C (2.0) or better and for pass/fail courses in which a passing grade was earned.  Developmental courses are not eligible for transfer.    17  Students are advised that they must take one or two courses in a foreign language (depending upon placement), two courses in Theology & Religious Studies, and a course in Ethics to complete the General Education requirements in the Undergraduate College at Rosemont, if they have not already done so at their original institution.   All other general education requirements will be considered fulfilled.   Students enrolled in an undergraduate program of study are required to complete a minimum of 120 credits (3 credit courses).  At least half the credits for the major must be taken at Rosemont.  Transferring From A Four-Year Institution  Students transferring from a four-year institution (college or university) may transfer up to maximum of 90 credits required for a baccalaureate degree into their undergraduate program of study at Rosemont College.    Transfer credit will be awarded only for courses in which the student earned a grade of C (2.0) or better.  Pass/fail courses and developmental courses are not eligible for transfer.  Courses completed at an institution utilizing a quarterly academic calendar will be accepted on a prorated scale.  Standardized exams will be accepted as transfer credit provided the student has earned the ACE recommended minimum score or the minimum score established at the College.    Students are advised that they must take one or two courses in a foreign language (depending upon placement), two courses in Theology & Religious Studies, and a course in Ethics and any other General Education courses needed to complete the General Education requirements in the Undergraduate College at Rosemont.  Students enrolled in an undergraduate program of study are required to complete a minimum of 120 credits (3 credit courses).  At least half the credits for the major must be taken at Rosemont.  Military Credits     Transfer of credits for military courses offered by the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Army Reserve, National Guard and Air Force will be considered upon receipt of notarized transcripts for courses that have American Council of Education (ACE) credit recommendations.  International Baccalaureate    Rosemont College grants a full year’s credit to a student who earns 30 or more credits toward the diploma with honor scores (5, 6, or 7) in three higher-level subjects.  Individual course credits are offered for honor scores on higher-level examinations as determined by individual disciplines.  Academic Scholarships Freshman and Transfer students are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships when they apply for admission to Rosemont (no separate application is required).  Scholarships are based on academics and are renewable up to 4 years as long as a college GPA of 3.0 is maintained.  Scholarship amounts can be found on our website at http://www.rosemont.edu/admissions/tuition-and-aid/financial-aid/undergraduate/scholarships-/index.php  International Applicants and Other Applicants with Foreign Credentials   Rosemont also welcomes first-year and transfer applications from international students. Applications must include the following: A completed international application;  An official high school transcript(s), GED certificate, or official transcript(s) of previous education equivalent to U.S. secondary and postsecondary education;  Evaluation of any and all foreign transcripts by ECE or WES;  Official results from the TOEFL, IELTS or SAT examination;  A personal essay  A letter of recommendation  Official documentation of adequate financial resources; and other documentation that the United States government may require. ESL preparation can be arranged through cooperating institutions during the summer months.  Advanced Placement Credits (AP)   The College awards credit through the College Entrance Examination Board’s Advanced Placement examinations.  Advanced Placement exams should be taken before graduating from high school.  It is the student’s responsibility to arrange for official test results to be sent to the Director of the Student Academic Support Center.  The chart below provides information about specific Advanced Placement examinations and the Rosemont courses with which they 18  correspond.  Grades are not awarded for Advanced Placement credit.  Advanced Placement credit is not reflected in the cumulative Rosemont grade point average.  Advanced Placement credit is awarded after the student has been accepted to Rosemont College and is applied toward the total number of credits necessary for graduation.  If Advanced Placement credit is awarded and represents a prerequisite for an upper-level course, the student is exempted from the prerequisite course.  A student with 30 Advanced Placement credits may be granted sophomore standing.   Students participating in one of the cooperative programs at Villanova University must have an AP score of 4 or higher to have those credits counted in transfer regardless of the subject area.   19    Exam Min Score Course Equivalent Credits Awarded Art and Music Art History 4 0  (610) 527-0200   The Main Campus map and description of all buildings and facilities of the main campus can be found on the web site.  Online Learning, Hybrid and Turbo Classes Many courses are available entirely online.  Students who register for online and hybrid courses (courses which are a combination of online and traditional format) are responsible for a suitable internet connection, daily access to the internet, and knowledge of internet navigation.  In addition, “Turbo” courses, are offered in a single weekend, from Friday evening through Sunday afternoon. 77          CONFIDENTIALITY OF STUDENT RECORDS  In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, as amended, Rosemont College releases student records only at the written request of the student. Directory information (name, dates of attendance, major field of study and degree conferred) will be released unless the student specifically directs, in writing, that directory information be withheld.  Students wishing to review their educational records must make the request in writing to the Office of the Registrar. The requested records will be made available to the student within a 45-day period. The written institutional policy may be obtained in the Office of the Registrar. Students whose employer requires a transcript should take particular note of this, and be sure to provide a written request to the Registrar when requesting transcripts to be sent. Students may request transcripts through the online ordering website located on the Registrar’s website or by submitting a paper transcript request form to the Office of the Registrar.  RIGHT TO INSPECTION AND REVIEW OF RECORDS       Any current or previously enrolled student has the right to inspect and review his or her education records within 45 days of the Office of the Registrar receiving a written request for access. This right does not extend to applicants, those denied admission, or those admitted who do not enroll. The Registrar's Office will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the requested records are not maintained by the Office of the Registrar, they will advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.  RIGHT TO AMEND RECORDS     Students have the right to request that inaccurate records be corrected.  In order to do so students should write the College official responsible for that particular record, clearly identify the part of the record they feel should be changed, and specify why it is inaccurate. If the decision is not to amend the record as requested by the student, the student will be notified and advised of his or her right to a hearing and be provided with information on how to proceed.   RIGHT TO CONSENT TO THE DISCLOSURE OF  PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION   All personally identifiable information related to a particular student other than directory information is considered confidential information and may not be released without the written consent of the student. One exception, which permits disclosure without consent, is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by Rosemont College in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff). A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.   A student's education records shall also be released if properly subpoenaed pursuant to a judicial, legislative, or administrative proceeding. The Office of the Registrar will make a reasonable attempt to notify the student and allow ten working days, from the date the subpoena was received, for the student to respond.   Directory information is not considered confidential and includes:   Name   Address   Class   Major field of study   Enrollment status   Dates of attendance   Degree(s) conferred   Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, currently enrolled students may withhold disclosure of directory information. To prevent disclosure, written notification must be received by the Office of the Registrar by October 1st in the fall semester and February 15th in the spring semester. The College will honor each request to withhold any of the categories of information listed above but cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for ROSEMONT COLLEGE STUDENT RIGHTS, RESPONSIBILITIES AND SERVICES 78  subsequent permission to release them. Decisions about withholding any information should be made very carefully. Should a student decide to inform the institution not to release certain information, any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused. Rosemont College assumes that failure to request the withholding of directory information indicates approval for disclosure.   RIGHT TO FILE A COMPLAINT     Students who feel that Rosemont College is not in compliance with the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act may file complaints with:   Family Policy Compliance Office  U.S. Department of Education  400 Maryland Avenue, SW  Washington, 0-1699  Transcript Request Forms that DO NOT bear your signature WILL NOT be honored.  Cost Unofficial transcripts are free of charge.  Official transcripts are $7.00 and can be mailed or emailed.  The fee covers postage for mailed transcripts sent via USPS First Class Mail.  Students/Alumnae who requests transcripts to be sent internationally or through an expedited method (Express Mail, UPS or FedEx), must pay for the additional shipping costs.  Official transcripts to be sent to other divisions of Rosemont College for purpose of admission to degree programs are free of charge.  Rush official transcripts are $7.00 per transcript plus the cost of express delivery depending upon destination.  3rd Party Requests Friends, parents, employers, and relatives may not request a transcript for students. Rosemont College adheres to FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) guidelines regarding the release of student records.   Transcript Processing Time Every effort is made to process transcripts within 3-5 business days of receipt. Transcripts are processed in the order of receipt. At peak times of the year, such as graduation and at the start of semesters, processing time may take longer. Please plan accordingly. We will do our best to assist you.

CAMPUS POST OFFICE     610/527-0200, Ext. 2249  Hours:  Monday-Friday 9:00am-5:00pm  COLLEGE BOOKSTORE     610/527-2912  Rosemont College will be welcoming a new bookstore vendor to campus effective July 1st.     The BBA Corporation, headquartered in Arkansas, specializes in serving small to medium-sized institutions of higher education.     BBA’s goal is to provide a student and faculty-focused bookstore that will make all the latest technological advancements in the textbook industry available to the Rosemont community. In addition to textbooks and course materials, they will carry a wide variety of dorm supplies, clothing, and gift items.    One of the most appealing and exciting features that BBA will be offering to Rosemont College is a new pricing structure that includes a fixed charge of $25 for each credit hour for which a student is registered. That means for a typical 3-credit course, students will pay a fixed rate of $75 for the rental of all required books and course materials for that course. BBA’s data have shown that students have saved an average of 35% per year on the cost of textbooks and other materials through their program. Every Rosemont student will be automatically enrolled in this cost-saving program and billed accordingly.    The new campus bookstore, BBA, can be found in the lower level of Alumnae Hall.    COUNSELING CENTER     610/527-0200, Ext. 2416   Hours:  Monday-Friday Located in St. Joseph’s Hall (lower level of the Chapel).  Call to schedule an appointment with a counselor.   Walk-ins are also welcome.  The Counseling Center promotes the personal well-being of all Rosemont students, and helps them overcome obstacles to their academic success. It offers a safe atmosphere for students to discuss any personal concerns or difficulties. Counseling services are voluntary, confidential, and included in your tuition.  While psychological testing is not provided on-site, the Center does use screening inventories for depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse. When necessary or requested, the staff can facilitate a referral to an outside agency as well as provide information about community resources concerning mental health issues.

GENERAL POLICIES  SELECTED SECURITY AND SAFETY POLICIES   Note: The full text of the Department of Public Safety’s Policies and Procedures can be found on the iWay.   Rosemont’s campus is kept peaceful through the efforts of the entire college community. Respect for others and their property and the responsibility of one's own actions is expected of everyone: students, staff, administrators, and faculty. While the college does not have a written policy regarding students with criminal records, the Admissions Office application and screening process is exceedingly thorough.  Rosemont College complies with all federal, state, and local laws. The Department of Public Safety, along with the Office of Student Life, offers programs on subjects such as drug and alcohol abuse, personal safety and security, rape prevention, and crime prevention. The Office also distributes printed crime prevention materials. 82  Campus security is monitored around the clock by the Director, full-time and part-time Public Safety Officers. All attend mandatory in-service training programs, which are updated regularly; a CPR and basic First-Aid course, and most have obtained PA State Act 235 Security Officer Certification.   Public Safety Officers conduct vehicle, bicycle, and foot patrols and are charged with the enforcement of federal, state, and local laws, as well as College policies and procedures. While Public Safety Officers do not carry firearms and do not have police powers of arrest, they maintain a close working relationship with the Lower Merion Township Police Department, who assist as needed. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for promoting a secure and safe environment for all campus members and guests.   The Office of Public Safety is also responsible for providing support services tailored to meet the needs of the Rosemont College community. Some of those services are to:   Issue identification cards;   Provide parking registration for students, faculty, and staff;   Provide an escort service for students, faculty, and staff;   Maintain a Lost and Found Department;   Inspect buildings and grounds for safety hazards;   Conduct fire safety education programs and periodic fire drills; and   Operate the Rose Line, which transports students between campus and public transportation facilities.   REPORTING CRIME ON CAMPUS    Students, faculty, staff, and guests of the College are expected to report emergencies and criminal activity to the Department of Public Safety immediately. To report an emergency or any criminal activity, dial 2555 from any campus phone or 610-527-1038 from any public phone.  In addition to telephones in each residence hall and at the doorways of each building, emergency telephones are located in various areas of the campus that automatically connect to the Public Safety Office when the telephone receiver is picked up.  All crimes involving violence, major property loss, or any felony are reported to the Township Police. In the event of an emergency or criminal incident, prompt notification is made to the campus community through the campus website, e-mail, text alerts, and/or postings in the residence halls and academic buildings.   BUILDINGS AND GROUNDS     The Department of Public Safety works closely with the Department of Physical Plant in the inspection of all buildings and grounds. The Department of Physical Plant provides an on-call system for handling emergencies during the off hours of the College. It is the responsibility of the Department of Public Safety to lock and unlock campus buildings, based on use, class schedules, and special events. Access to institutional facilities by employees and students is on an as-needed basis and only after proper identification has been shown. Visitors to the campus seeking access to campus facilities for special events must do so through an individual host, a sponsoring department, the Community Relations Assistant, or through the Department of Public Safety.  At 8 p.m. entrances to the campus are secured with access occurring at the main entrance, with a manned gatehouse.  Access to housing facilities is limited to those with authorization. Any person entering or attempting to enter a residence hall without authorization will be asked to leave by the Residence Staff, the Desk Assistant, or Public Safety. Rosemont students are required to have their guests sign in, leave I.D., and obtain a guest pass while visiting. Desk assistants are assigned to the desk at the main entrance of each residence hall during the day and most of the night.  FIRE SAFETY       The Department of Public Safety conducts all fire drills. Unannounced fire drills for both residence halls and academic buildings are conducted each semester.  STUDENT AND STAFF RESPONSIBILITY   The cooperation, involvement, and personal support of the members of the Rosemont College Community in a campus safety program are crucial to the success of the program.   Room and office doors should be locked even when left for a short period of time.  Cars should 83  be parked in lighted areas and should be kept locked at all times. Valuables should also be concealed.   Suspicious activities should be reported immediately to Public Safety.   Students and Staff should use the Escort Service in the evening hours.

The program incorporates critical thinking and decision making skills in all functional areas. As the economy becomes increasingly more global, the next frontier will be improved decision-making that cuts across boundaries and countries. Students must be able to integrate knowledge, judgment, and strategic-planning skills to respond to this need.  Our program in its entirety and within each discrete subject area puts students into the role of the decision-maker as active participants. The student must incorporate knowledge from the various courses, analyze factual situations in the operating environment, and make informed decisions founded on the integration of that knowledge. Course emphasis is on the understanding of basic knowledge and the application of that knowledge to real-life situations. This will enable our students to adapt to a variety of roles within organizations and society. Classroom learning will be enhanced through internships, service learning, or study abroad. Students will select which of these possibilities most enhances their academic and personal experience.  Each course within the program of study actively incorporates analytical and critical thinking skills through the use of case studies, written analysis, and real-life problems. These help the student to develop communication, organizational skills, and teamwork necessary for a problem solver.  The capstone project for all Business majors is the Senior Seminar. This course is the final integrating experience where students are expected to incorporate the knowledge from the various business courses and apply it in the role of the decision-maker.  PROGRAM GOALS    GOAL 1: For students to be able to integrate the knowledge from their Business courses in an effective presentation, both written and oral in the Capstone Project/Senior Seminar.  Objective 1: To demonstrate their learning of these concepts in a simulation or case study that mirrors a real life business problem.  GOAL 2: To be able to use the key ideas and concepts of the business world.  Objective 1: Be able to analyze financial statements. Objective 2: Be able to analyze cost concepts. Objective 3: Be able to support a decision based on their analysis of the facts in the situation. Objective 4: Be able to approach challenging ethical decisions in business , fully considering the moral aspects along with the financial considerations of managerial decisions.  GOAL 3: To encourage students to communicate more effectively in a professional setting.  GOAL 4: To improve decision-making skills.

FERPA requires that federally funded institutions, under programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, comply with certain procedures with regard to disclosing and maintaining educational records. FERPA was not enacted to preclude the disclosure of educational records simply because the records identify a student by name; rather, it was designed to protect the student’s educational information and status as a student. Parents should understand that their rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a postsecondary school at any age.  Who is a student? According to FERPA, a student is an individual who is enrolled in and attends an educational institution. The regulations provide that attendance includes, but is not limited to, attendance in person or by correspondence. Individuals who “attend” classes but are not physically located on a campus are also students, thus including those who attend classes by video conference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic information and telecommunications technologies.  FERPA prohibits the disclosure of a student’s “protected information” to a third party. This disclosure is prohibited whether it is made by hand delivery, verbally, fax, mail, or electronic transmission. Disclosure also includes the provision of access to the educational institution’s career center database of student information.  What information is protected? FERPA classifies protected information into three categories: educational information, personally identifiable information (PII) and directory information. The limitations imposed by FERPA vary with respect to each category.  Personally identifiable information can only be disclosed if the educational institution obtains the signature of the student on a document specifically identifying the information to be disclosed, the reason for the disclosure, and the parties to whom the disclosure will be made. Examples of PII include: student’s name, date of birth, student ID or SSN, and other information which can be used to distinguish an individual’s identity in relation to academic records.   Educational information cannot be disclosed without prior approval of the student. FERPA defines “education records” as “records, files, documents, and other materials” that are “maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a person acting for such agency or institution.” This includes transcripts, GPA, grades, social security number, and academic evaluations, and records that pertain to an individual’s previous attendance as a student of an institution.  Directory information can be disclosed by the institution without consent. Directory information is defined as “information contained in an education record of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.” This includes such items as a list of students’ names, addresses, and telephone numbers, and also includes a student ID number (which includes electronic identifiers) provided it cannot be used to gain access to education records. Directory information, however, does not include a student’s social security number nor can the social security number be used to confirm directory information. If a student decides to “opt out” of the disclosure of directory information, the “opt out” continues indefinitely.  What does the release cover? Rosemont College cannot provide information about a student’s academic records, including performance in a class, grades, or registrations to a third party without written consent by the student. Information will only be provided after the identity of the third party is verified. If Rosemont cannot verify the identity they may choose not to disclose information.  Student can revoke FERPA consent at any time.    22  ACADEMIC PLANNING, ADVISING, OPTIONS AND POLICIES MAJORS      Majors generally consist of 33 to 45 credits in a particular discipline.

Majors will be recorded on the student’s transcript but do not appear on the diploma.  Option 26. Individualized Major  A student may request approval for an individualized major in consultation with appropriate faculty.   The individualized major provides a means of undertaking a coordinated program of study that differs significantly from those offered by the various majors.  The purpose of the program is to accommodate the student with an academic interest not defined by a single discipline.  Ordinarily such interest will be interdisciplinary.  The program has three elements:  1. A description of the study area which delineates a significant body of material sufficient to merit intensive study. 2. A plan of study that details the specific courses of the major, totaling at least 36 credits. 3. An integrative experience in the senior year, providing the opportunity for the student to engage in a creative academic project.  Applications for acceptance of the individualized major program should be submitted by the student to the Academic Standards Committee of the Undergraduate College, during the student’s sophomore year.  Applicants will be expected to have and to maintain a minimum 3.000 cumulative grade point average.  MINORS      Minors generally consist of six to eight courses in a particular discipline or in an interdisciplinary program of study.  Currently, the Undergraduate College offers the following Minors:  Visual Arts & Letters Division 1. History of Art 2. Studio Art and Design 3. Communication 4. English 5. Theater  Humanities Division 6. Spanish 7. History 8. Philosophy 9. Ethics and Leadership 10. Theology and Religious Studies 11. Women and Gender Studies  Natural and Professional Studies Division 12. Biology 13. Biology –Environmental Science Track 14. Biochemistry 15. Chemistry 16. Mathematics  Social Science Division 17. Business - Accounting 18. Business – Finance 19. Business – International Business 20. Business – Management 21. Business – Marketing 22. Business – Sport Management 23. Political Science 24. Political Science – International Relations 25. Political Science – pre-Law 26. Psychology 27. Sociology  Under certain conditions, a student may have a minor field designated on his/her Rosemont transcript.  Candidates for the minor select 21-24 credits above the introductory level in a discipline.  These courses are chosen from the courses listed in the Academic Offerings section of this catalog for approved minors.  A minimum 2.000 cumulative grade point average is required to complete the minor.  CONCENTRATION     A concentration consists of at least twelve credits in a particular area of study within a major.  Currently, the Undergraduate College offers the following Concentrations:  Writing A minimum 3.000 cumulative grade point average is required to complete the concentration.  CERTIFICATIONS     Currently the Undergraduate College offers the following programs leading to certification by the Pennsylvania Department of Education:  Elementary Education PK-4  Elementary Education PK-4 with PK-8 Special Education  Art Education PK-12  Spanish PK-12  Secondary Education, grades 7-12:   Biology 24    Chemistry   English   History/Social Studies   Mathematics  Post-Baccalaureate Pre-Medical Certification    Note:  The number of credits required varies, depending on the specific certificate sought and the related courses taken by the student. Furthermore, ALL certificates issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Education require that candidates maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0, complete a minimum of 125 hours of field experience and 14 weeks of student teaching, and pass all required PRAXIS/PECT tests.   COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS   A comprehensive examination in the major subject, or its equivalent, is required of all candidates for a degree in the Undergraduate College.  The faculty of each field of study shall determine the form of the examination, its length, and the time of administration.  Please see the respective major areas for details.  A student who fails the comprehensive examination may re-take the examination in time for graduation in the same academic year, but not sooner than two weeks after receiving notice of failure in the first examination.  In cases of a second failure, the student’s graduation will be postponed until the student passes the comprehensive exam in the subsequent academic year.  The Registrar will post the dates for comprehensive examinations.  THESIS       A Thesis may be required as determined by the departmental faculty.  SECOND DEGREE STUDENTS    Students seeking a second baccalaureate degree, who already possess a baccalaureate degree from a regionally accredited college or university (i.e. Middle States Commission on Higher Education), are required to complete major requirements in the academic area of the second degree, but are not required to fulfill core requirements a second time.  Students should note, however, that some majors require courses outside of their discipline as part of the program of study.  If a student has not previously taken a required supporting course, the student will need to do so as part of their program of study at Rosemont towards the second degree.  A maximum of 90 credits from the prior degree may be accepted as credit towards the Rosemont degree.    Majors in the Undergraduate College typically range from 33 to 45 credits.  At least 30 credits in the major must be taken at Rosemont College.  The exceptions are the B.S. in Elementary Education (63-69 credits) and the B.F.A. in Studio Art which requires 76 credits.  At least half the credits for these majors must be taken at Rosemont College.  Most degrees require 120 credits with the exception of the Bachelors of Fine Arts which requires at least 126 credits.  Applications for entering Rosemont under this program should be made through the Office of Admissions, Undergraduate College (610-527 0200 Ext. 2966 or 1-888-2-ROSEMONT). Advising for this program is initially done through the Student Academic Support Center.  3 + 4 AND 4 + 4 PROGRAMS WITH PHILADELPHIA COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE      Rosemont College has a joint program with Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (“PCOM”) that allows up to 3 students per year from Rosemont College to be admitted to the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine Program provided said students have successfully completed their undergraduate prerequisites for medical school at Rosemont College and fulfilled the admission requirements for PCOM.   The Affiliated PCOM-Rosemont College Education curriculum consists of two academic alternatives, both of which require the student to successfully complete four years of medical school education at PCOM:  Accelerated Academic Program (3+4) – students must have completed a minimum of 90 undergraduate semester hours at Rosemont College and enter PCOM following their junior year.  Traditional Academic Program (4+4) –students who have completed all requirements for the Bachelor of Science Degree and enter PCOM following their senior year at Rosemont College.    Applicants will be accepted into the Program if they satisfy the eligibility requirements, are recommended for admission by the Rosemont Per-Health advisors, and are interviewed and accepted 25  by PCOM’s Faculty Committee on Admissions.

Admissions Process 1. Interviews: In September of each year, the Joint Committee will select candidates to be interviewed for acceptance into the Program.  No applicant whose application is incomplete will be considered for an interview. 2. Final Decision on Admission: The final decision on admission to the Program shall be made by the PCOM’s Faculty Committee on Admissions after receiving the recommendation of the Pre-Health Advisors and the candidate has had a formal PCOM interview.  Final decisions for admission in the 3+4 program will be made in March of their junior year whereas for the 4+4 program decisions will be made no later than June of the year in which the application is submitted for the term beginning the following August.   4 + 1 AND 4 + 2 PROGRAMS WITH DREXEL UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF NURSING ACCELERATED CAREER ENTRY (ACE) BSN______ Rosemont College has a joint program with Drexel University College of Nursing that allows 10 students per year that have earned a bachelor’s degree from Rosemont College to be admitted to the Accelerated Career Entry program at Drexel University and earn a BSN. Candidates have an 11-month or a 24-month option for completion of the ACE Program.  Admission Requirements:  Candidates must have a bachelor’s degree from Rosemont College with a 3.0 overall GPA  Candidates must not have a grade of C or below on the science prerequisites or prior nursing courses  Accepted students must complete all prerequisites at least 2 months prior matriculation  3 + 4 PROGRAM WITH USCIENCES DOCTOR OF PHARMACY (PHARM.D.)____________________________ Rosemont College has a joint program with the USciences that allows 5 students per year to earn both a Bachelors of Arts (B.A.) degree from Rosemont and the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) degree at USciences in 7 years after graduation from high school. Eligible students may spend the first 3 years at Rosemont and then matriculate to USciences for the four professional years of the Pharm.D. program.  Students will receive the B.A. degree in Biology from Rosemont upon successful 26  completion of all requirements while matriculated at USciences.    For admission into the program students must have completed the following requirements:  Minimum PCAT composite score of 25  Completion of required pre-professional work with a grade of C or better  Minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5 and a minimum natural science/math GPA of 3.0  Evidence of having shadowed a pharmacist for a minimum of 40 hours  Successful candidates will apply via the online Pharmacy College Application Service (PharmCAS) and have a personal interview with a Philadelphia College of Pharmacy faculty. A decision is normally made after completion of the 5th semester at Rosemont.  ROSEMONT COLLEGE POST BACCALAUREATE PRE-MEDICAL PROGRAM    Rosemont College’s Post Baccalaureate Pre-medical program is designed to prepare students to enter graduate or professional school programs in the health care fields.  This program serves two groups of students: Career Changers and/or Record Enhancers.  All applicants must have a Bachelor’s degree to be admitted to the program.  CAREER CHANGER PROGRAM    This program is ideal for students who have not yet taken the science courses necessary for graduate or professional school programs in medicine, dentistry, physical therapy, physician assistant or any other professional health program.  Students will be able to take the necessary courses to prepare for the entrance examinations and apply to the respective programs. In order to receive the certificate, students must take a minimum of 28 credits of the course requirements in science and related fields at Rosemont College.  The time needed to complete the program approximates 20 months.  Students are encouraged to take their time and move at their own pace so that they can do as well as possible in preparation for the professional examinations.  Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA for any courses taken at Rosemont College.  Students should review the specific admissions requirements to the schools they will be applying in order to determine any additional requirements they should take prior to applying to those professional programs.    RECORD ENHANCER PROGRAM    This program allows students who have previously taken science courses to retake those in which they desire to improve their GPA and also to prepare for the entrance examinations.  Students may choose which courses they need to take to improve their record.   Rosemont College provides small class sizes and individual attention by experienced professors in each of the subject areas.  Students in the Post Baccalaureate Pre-medical program receive one-on-one advising throughout the program of study, assistance with course selection and professional school applications.  Students who successfully complete the program will receive a letter of recommendation to include in their application to professional and /or graduate school.   Students have the opportunity to do research with Rosemont College faculty or faculty at an affiliated institution.  Students may also do volunteer work with local medical facilities.    Rosemont College also offers a one credit MCAT Review course to all pre-health and Post Baccalaureate students.  THREE-YEAR BACHELOR’S DEGREE PROGRAM  Rosemont College’s three-year bachelor’s degree is a unique opportunity for highly motivated and academically prepared students who are focused on a specific major. Faculty advisors customize a degree plan to include any advanced placement or other college-level work they have already completed and to make sure they get the most well-rounded and comprehensive liberal arts education possible.  Majors participating in the Three-year Bachelor’s Degree Program include:  Accounting  Biology  Chemistry  English  Finance  History  International Business  Management  Marketing  Political Science  Psychology   Sociology  Sport Management  27  Candidates for the three-year program are required to have a minimum high school GPA of 3.50.  Students participating in the three-year program will take fifteen credits in their first semester, eighteen credits in subsequent semesters, and attend two summer sessions after the first and second years (unless transferring AP/IB credits or other college credits eliminating one or both summer sessions).  Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA each semester in order to remain in the program.  ENRICHMENT CREDITS     Recognizing that there exist many cultural and educational activities that are not part of conventional course offerings, but which nonetheless enhance the student’s academic experience, Rosemont offers a number of enrichment credit options.  Students are eligible to take such enrichment courses for 1 to 3 credits.  Past offerings have included courses such as film editing, leadership, advising, and musical performance.  Publication editors are also eligible to receive enrichment credits.  CROSS REGISTRATION     Undergraduate College/Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies Cross Registration Policy Full-time matriculated students in the Undergraduate College (UC) may register for courses in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies (SGPS) provided that they meet the conditions outlined below:  Undergraduate Accelerated Courses  Students who have permission of their undergraduate faculty advisor and the UC and SGPS Academic Deans may register for SGPS undergraduate accelerated classes not available in the UC.  Students are permitted to take a maximum of two (2) courses in SGPS during their time in the UC without incurring additional tuition cost.  Students are not permitted to take more than one (1) course per accelerated session.    Students must follow all registration procedures as set forth by the policy on SGPS Transfer Credits. Graduate Courses  Students enrolled in a Dual Degree program can begin taking courses in the Graduate School during their Junior and/or Senior year in the Undergraduate College.  Twelve (12) credits taken in the Graduate School will be counted towards the student’s baccalaureate degree.  See specific programs for details.       Students who have not been admitted to a dual degree program may begin their graduate coursework while simultaneously completing their baccalaureate degree.  Such students must have an overall GPA of at least 3.00 (on a 4.00 point scale) and may register for a maximum of two Graduate courses during their senior year.  Note, students must have obtained a grade of B or higher in any/all prerequisite courses.  These courses must be selected in consultation with the student’s UC academic advisor, and the appropriate program director of SGPS.  Graduate courses will count only towards the master’s degree and not towards completion of the baccalaureate degree.  Separate SGPS tuition fees will be charged. INTER-INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS   Taking Courses at Other Institutions After Matriculation Rosemont College has developed inter-institutional cooperative agreements with other institutions of higher education, particularly the SEPCHE schools, and Eastern and Villanova Universities.  Under these agreements, students at each institution may take courses at the other institutions.  A student is limited to no more than one course each semester, if the course or its equivalent is not offered at Rosemont in the same semester.  The exchange is primarily for the purpose of enrichment in course offerings or electives, but in some instances major courses may be taken if approved by the faculty advisor.  The quality points and credits earned in these courses will be transferred and will affect the Rosemont student’s cumulative grade point average.  Inter-institutional programs are not open to students during their first year, and such programs function only in fall and spring semesters. Rosemont College is a member of the South Eastern Pennsylvania Consortium for Higher Education 28  (SEPCHE).  SEPCHE is a consortium of seven independent higher education institutions in the Greater Philadelphia region that engage in a collaborative approach to meet the challenges of higher education and work together to promote quality and efficiency of operations and community outreach, through sharing of a range of multi-functional activities, services, and information.  Members of SEPCHE are:  Cabrini University, Chestnut Hill College, Gwynedd-Mercy University, Holy Family University, Immaculata University, Neumann University, and Rosemont College.  More information on SEPCHE, and individual academic calendars, can be found at www.SEPCHE.org or by calling 610-902-8408.  Rosemont College full-time undergraduate matriculated students, paying full-time tuition, may register for up to two undergraduate courses each year at any SEPCHE member institution.  This cross-registration program is designed to provide increased educational opportunities for students enrolled at any member institution by giving students the option to take courses that are not offered at the home campus and to experience the varied and diverse resources on member campuses across the Delaware Valley. A student must have completed at least one year as a full-time student at his/her home campus before taking courses through the SEPCHE cross-registration program.  Courses may not be taken at a member institution if that course or its equivalent is offered by the home institution in the same semester.  No tuition or fees will be charged by the host institution, except for special or extra fees that are part of the courses taken, such as lab fees.  The cross-registration does not apply to accelerated or weekend courses, independent study, tutorials, internships, practicum, field experience, student teaching, or to per-credit-hour or graduate courses. Rosemont students enrolled in courses at SEPCHE institutions are subject to the calendar, schedule, and regulations of these institutions.  It is the student’s responsibility to learn these regulations.  Course schedules of these institutions may be obtained in the Office of the Registrar during the pre-registration period. On issues of academic honesty, policies of the host institution will prevail. BACHELOR’S/MASTER’S OPTION   Dual-Degree Application Process and Procedures Dual Degree programs allow current undergraduate Rosemont students to begin taking graduate courses as early as their junior year and to transfer seamlessly to Rosemont’s School of Graduate and Professional Studies.

Once admitted to the graduate program, undergraduate students can take no more than  one (1) graduate course per semester beginning their junior year (no ore than twelve (12) graduate credits may be applied to undergraduate degree requirements).  Students may take graduate courses during the graduate summer semester.  Students will complete their baccalaureate degree within four years and may continue in the graduate college in the summer semester immediately following graduation..  Dual Degree Time Line: MFA in Creative Writing, MA in Publishing, MBA, MS in Strategic Leadership, MS in Healthcare Administration.  Undergraduate Career: 12 graduate credit hours  Graduate Summer Semester: 6 graduate credit hours Graduate Fall Semester: 9 graduate credit hours Graduate Spring Semester:  9 graduate credit hours TOTAL:  36 graduate credit hours      MA in Counseling  Undergraduate Career: 12 graduate credit hours Graduate Summer Semester: 9 graduate credit hours  Graduate Fall Semester: 9 graduate credit hours  Graduate Spring Semester: 9 graduate credit hours Graduate Summer Semester: 9 graduate credit hours  Graduate Fall Semester: 9 graduate credit hours Graduate Spring Semester: 3 graduate credit hours   TOTAL: 60 graduate credit hours  GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS Students will be able to count three (3) classes in their major towards GE; 9-12 credit hours depending upon whether the courses are 3 credits or 4 credits.  Exceptions will be granted to students in the Bachelor of Science degree program in Elementary Education and the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree program in Art.  Students pursuing either of these degree programs will be allowed to count four (4) classes in their majors towards GE.    A course taken to fulfill a given category in the General Education curriculum will not count in another category for the General Education curriculum.   Unless students place at the 300-level or higher, they must take two courses in the same language, i.e. "
FRE 0101,".  Please note, if the same course is cross-listed with different prefixes, students must choose one prefix and one category for the course to fulfill the General Education requirement.  THE FIRST YEAR CONNECTION SEMINAR  The goals of the First Year Connection Seminar are to help students deepen three key connections:  (1) with themselves (their strengths and interests, future plans and aspirations, self-directed learning, cultural background);  (2) with Rosemont College (history and mission, collegiate-level expectations, power of a liberal arts education, co-curricular learning, bonding with faculty and other students);  30  (3) with the larger world (strength in diversity, global and cross-cultural knowledge and perspectives).  The seminar also seeks to develop skills and strategies that are applicable and valuable across subjects (transferable, cross-disciplinary skills) and across time (durable, lifelong learning skills), including such competencies as thinking critically, communicating effectively, accessing and evaluating information, and working collaboratively.  ETHICS IN ACTION     The overarching goal of the Ethics in Action area is to provide students with a practical foundation for reasoned moral decision-making. The courses in this category seek to foster this practice by enabling students to develop the critical skills and analytical frameworks essential to identify, characterize, and resolve ethical problems likely to arise in their careers and in their lives as a whole. Each course introduces students to fundamental ethical concepts, perspectives, and theories, and explores how these bear on issues unique to the subject of the course. Through exposure to a variety of approaches including application of theory, case study analysis, narrative analysis, and decision-making procedures, students will become aware of the implications of their own ethical views, and will develop the skills necessary for both resolving ethical problems thoughtfully and for attaining a greater sense of moral responsibility.  EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING    The General Education curriculum contains an experiential education requirement for all students.  To comply with this requirement, the Office of Post Graduate Success coordinates internships, service learning, undergraduate research, and study abroad experiences to assist students in their learning activities.  The office is a resource for students in securing internships during the academic year and the summer.  Further, the office participates with faculty in the evaluation of internship goals and learning outcomes.  The office also helps faculty incorporate Service Learning into their classes by developing contacts with outside community organizations.  Service Learning relies on a pedagogy which involves cooperation between faculty, students and community organizations in an interactive learning experience.  In an increasingly interdependent world, study abroad is an important and vital component of any educational experience.  With the assistance of this office, students can explore a large variety of study abroad options.  INTERNSHIPS      Full semester internships are student-initiated and can be arranged for qualified students in most disciplines with the approval of the faculty advisor.  Students should seek information from their advisors and the Director of Post Graduate Success.  The College encourages every student to consider taking an internship as part of the Experiential Component.  Information on credit and non-credit internships is available in the Office of Post Graduate Success.    Significant criteria for internships include:  Students are required to have a GPA of at least 2.0 in order to participate in an internship.  The student must apply for internship credit in a timely manner, completing the forms available in the Office of Post Graduate Success by the end of the drop/add period for the semester.  The application must include a detailed description of the terms of the internship and evaluative procedures to be used during the semester.  The student must spend a minimum of thirty-two (32) hours at the internship site for every academic credit the student receives.  Even when a student is participating in a non-credit internship, a minimum of thirty-two hours is required at the internship site.  In order to verify the hours completed, the student must keep a detailed time sheet that is signed by his or her on-site supervisor each week.  The student must have an on-site sponsor who takes responsibility for teaching them, avoiding merely routine tasks.  The student’s faculty advisor and the Director of Post Graduate Success will monitor and evaluate the internship, visiting the site whenever feasible.  The student will keep a journal, write papers, or perform other reflective written assignments, as directed by the faculty supervisor.  These assignments are not necessarily the student’s only obligation for the course.  There will be an evaluation form for the student and the supervisor as part of the internship experience. These will be kept in the student’s permanent file.  These forms, along with the time sheet, must be 31  submitted to the Director of Post Graduate Success by the last day of classes in the Undergraduate College.    Internships are graded as Pass or Fail.  A failing grade (F) will negatively affect a student’s grade point average.  Students must work with the Office of Post Graduate Success prior to the start of the semester to secure their internship and complete the internship application, due to the Registrar’s Office prior to the end of registration  In collaboration with the academic department and the Director of Post Graduate Success, credits for internships will be determined based on duration and academic merit of the internship.  INDEPENDENT STUDY     Opportunities for independent study are offered to enrolled students on an individual basis.  Ordinarily, a student studies with an instructor who agrees to direct his/her work.  Since Independent Study requires more initiative and organization than in-class work, the student must be able and willing to meet all of the requirements of the contract the student signs with the professor responsible for the course.  Approval is acquired through the Independent Study contract submitted to the UC Academic Dean prior to the start of the semester in which the Independent Study will occur.  Normally, Independent Studies are 1-3 credits, a grade is assigned, and the standard cost per credit charged. Only under exceptional circumstances, may a student undertake a course identical to one found under Courses of Instruction in the catalogue on an Independent Study basis.    SUMMER STUDY     Students wishing to supplement their academic program through summer study may do so at Rosemont.  Rosemont offers a variety of courses in its summer sessions.  Registration for summer courses begins at the same time as Fall preregistration (mid-March).  Course information is listed on the iWay.    Students who wish to take classes at other institution must receive permission prior to taking the course.  The student must complete and submit the “Off Campus Approval Form” to the Registrar’s Office and submit an official transcript after the course is taken.  No more than two (2) courses (6-8 credits) per summer will be approved.  Grades from summer school courses taken at other institutions are not computed into the student’s cumulative average. No credits will be awarded for summer school courses taken at other institutions for which the student received a grade below a C (2.0). This includes courses taken at Eastern University and SEPCHE schools.  Students are not ordinarily permitted to take courses in summer school at other institutions to fulfill either general education requirements or major program requirements. If there are extenuating circumstances and a student wishes to take a general education requirement at another institution, the student must first speak with their major advisor.  If the major advisor approves this, the major advisor must obtain written permission from the Discipline Coordinator at Rosemont College that offers this general education requirement.  The Academic Dean’s permission must also be received in writing.  STUDY ABROAD     Students may enroll in programs of study abroad for Rosemont credit.  To be eligible, a student must have an overall GPA of at least 2.0 and the approval of the Director of Post Graduate Success and the faculty advisor. Pre-approved courses are transferable if the student earns a C (2.0) or higher, but these grades are not computed into the cumulative grade point average.  It is the responsibility of the student to have all study abroad transcripts sent to the Registrar’s Office at the conclusion of the time abroad in order to facilitate the transfer credits.  Students studying abroad during the fall semester and returning to Rosemont College for the spring semester must return to class no later than the first week of Rosemont classes before the end of drop/add.  All study abroad candidates for fall and/or spring of the following academic year must notify the Director of Post Graduate Success during the preceding semester.  Rosemont grants and scholarships are not transferable for study abroad.  Short-Term Study Abroad Courses (with 1-4 weeks travel) listed as spring or fall courses at any SEPCHE institution are included in the courses that are eligible for cross registration. Students who qualify for the SEPCHE cross registration program are not charged additional tuition to cross register for one 32  of these courses. The student is responsible, however, for all travel-related costs.  Students wishing to study abroad on short-term programs run by Rosemont College faculty must have successfully completed at least one semester of classes at Rosemont and abide by the above mentioned GPA requirements.  Approval from the Academic Dean is required to override the GPA requirement.  SERVICE LEARNING     Service learning, the integration of course content in the classroom with service activities in the community, will be offered in selected courses.  Such courses will carry the regular course credit and will fulfill the experiential requirement for graduation.  Service learning classes are listed on the class schedule each semester.  Students enrolled in service-learning courses must complete a minimum of 20 hours of service at their service site and submit a time sheet to the Director of Post Graduate Success, signed by his or her supervisor each week, to verify the completion of hours.  More information about service learning can be obtained from the student’s faculty advisor and the Director of Post Graduate Success.  GENERAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM   The General Education curriculum is a student’s academic introduction to Rosemont College. It exposes you to the fundamental ideas and intellectual activities that Rosemont embraces in the Mission statement of the College.   This curriculum reinforces the idea that all members of Rosemont College participate in a community of learners.    Through this General Education curriculum we hope to convey to our students that the purpose of a liberal arts education is to do more than train students for the workplace.  It is also meant to cultivate cultural, religious, and artistic sensibilities, to ground students in ethical decision making, to foster critical thinking, and to convey the joy of learning that is fundamental to Rosemont College.  To these ends, we have based our General Education program on five perennial questions:   1. What skills do we need to function effectively in today’s society both locally and globally? 2. Intellectual and practical skills including effective habits of inquiry and analysis, critical thinking, written and oral communication, information literacy, and teamwork/problem solving. 3. Why is human culture so diverse, and what can we learn by studying the ways of others? 4. Knowledge of human cultures through their histories, languages religious traditions, literature, and arts.  5. Why is knowledge of the ideas and practices of natural science and mathematics essential to our lives today?   Scientific and quantitative skills and reasoning. 6. How should we live our lives, and how should we treat others?   Ethical reasoning and religious consciousness; intercultural awareness and sensitivity. 7. How can we transform what we learn in our lifetimes into actions that improve the quality of both our lives and the lives of others?   Integrative learning including capstone projects, learning abroad, internships, and service learning.           33  THE CORE Core Courses    9 cr  First Year Connection Seminar  Intermediate French "

This course emphasizes a social-psychological perspective that centers on the complex interaction of personal and situational factors underpinning both good and evil behavior. That is, the conditions under which people are kind and helpful to others or, conversely, under which they commit harmful and even violent acts. The course explores various formulations of good and evil and the different answers given to it. Examination of key theories, concepts, and findings from research in social psychology as well as drawing on examples from history are the goals of this course.

Among the experiential components a student can choose are internships, service learning, undergraduate research and study abroad opportunities.  These opportunities may be credit bearing and vary in the credits assigned to them or in some cases, not for credit.  These experiences are related to the student’s program of study and provide an important linkage between classroom theory and actual practice.  Students should work closely with their faculty mentors and professors to identify the experience most suitable to the student’s academic and personal goals.    Senior Capstone   3 cr  The Senior Capstone is offered in a student’s major.  Most Senior Capstone courses are only offered in the spring semester.  Many of these courses have specific prerequisites.  Students should meet with their academic mentor to determine when the student will enroll in this course.  Students with double majors may be required to complete two Seniors Capstone courses or projects.  36  HONORS PROGRAM The Honors Program provides intellectually challenging and stimulating honors courses for students interested in a dynamic educational experience that extends beyond the standard curriculum.  Honors courses will be either disciplinary or interdisciplinary and will be distinguished from regular offerings with respect to depth of study and work expectations. The courses will be small and will emphasize discussion, in order to provide students with a more in-depth encounter with the material and to encourage interaction with faculty advisors and other motivated and talented students.    The Honors Program experience will also extend beyond the classroom. Students will have the opportunity to attend lectures, museums, musical performances, and other intellectual and artistic events. Moreover, students will be required to participate in Student Leadership, Service Learning, or civic engagement opportunities.  Indeed, the unifying aims of the Honors Program are to offer rigorous yet lively academic opportunities, to develop leadership skills, and to foster an awareness of social responsibility.  Ultimately, the Rosemont Honors Program will provide membership in a community of learners who are creative thinkers and engaged student leaders in the classroom and beyond.   GOALS       The goals of the Honors Program are drawn from the goals of the General Education curriculum, and seek to develop skills in the following areas:  Critical Thinking  Written Communication  Oral Communication  Scholarly Inquiry  Intercultural Knowledge  Civic Engagement  Leadership  The extent to which the goals are met will be determined through the use of AACU rubrics specifically designed for assessment of the above areas.    HIGHLIGHTS       Intellectually challenging and stimulating honors courses for students interested in a broad educational experience.  Honors courses that are designed to meet General Education and major requirements and that are often offered with an interdisciplinary approach to a given subject, with advising and support by the Director of the Honors Program.  Service learning opportunities and leadership programs.   Advising and support for applications to competitive scholarship programs such as Gillman, Marshall, Fulbright, Truman, Udall, and others.  ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS    New Students   Minimum combined SAT score of 1150 (math and critical reading), with no score lower than 500 in either Math or Critical Reading (or permission of the Academic Dean) and a high school GPA of 3.50 or higher.

Honors Program participants must maintain a 3.3333 (B+) cumulative GPA.  They are not allowed any grades less than C and no more than two grades less than B during the entire course of their studies at Rosemont.   The Academic Standards Committee will review the progress of Honors Program participants at the end of each semester.  Transfer students may have their honors general education and honors seminar requirements adjusted upon review of their transcripts.  All students invited to participate in the Honors Program will attend an orientation meeting where all benefits and requirements will be discussed in detail.  Students wishing to participate will be required to sign a contract indicating that they understand and agree to all aspects of the Honors Program.   New first year students who complete four honors GE courses and receive no grade lower than a B in all the courses they take are eligible for First Year Honors.  Unless granted a specific waiver by the Director of the Honors Program, students in the Honors Program will be required to complete a minimum of three credits of honors classes each semester.  Students in the pre-med program do not need to take an honors class in the spring semester of their sophomore year.  They must still fulfill all honors requirements.   All honors students must maintain a 3.3300 (B+) average (semester and cumulative) with no grade less than a C in any course to remain eligible for the Honors Program. Students earning less than a C in any course may be dismissed from the Program with no right of appeal. In addition, students are allowed only two grades less than B over the course of their program of study. Students who fall below this requirement will be suspended from the Honors Program and will be ineligible to register for honors classes during the following semester. Students who earn a minimum of a 3.50 GPA during the following semester can petition to be readmitted to the Honors Program.  The criterion of no grade less 38  than C, and no more than two grades less than B, will hold for students who are reapplying to the program. The decision to readmit students into the Honors Program will be made by the Academic Standards and Practices committee, which will review the status of all Honors Program participants at the end of every semester. Students who accrue more than two grades below a B will be dropped from the Honors Program.  Honors Program participants are not allowed to register for any honors courses Pass/Fail.  HONORS COURSES     Each semester the Undergraduate College offers a series of honors courses that fulfill General Education requirements.   These courses, capped at 15 students, are sections of already existing courses which offer students the opportunity for a more enriched and enhanced encounter with the material.  While expectations for reading, writing, and discussion are high, the primary difference between Honors and non-Honors sections of the same courses lies not in the amount of work, but in the depth of study and critical reflection on the material. Emphasis is given to primary sources (when applicable) rather than survey texts. Additionally, in any given class, students are likely to attend one or more off-campus events.  Students may not take more than two Honors courses during one semester.  Courses are designated on the course listing schedule with an “H”.

Students planning to go to a professional health school should ascertain the specific entrance requirements of the professional schools to which they intend to apply as well as consult with their faculty advisor.  PRE-LAW      A traditional liberal arts program is recognized and sought by law schools.  Generally no specific major or set of courses is prescribed for entrance.  A student should select a curriculum that enables him/her to strengthen skills in argument, analysis, and communication.  Rosemont does offer a pre-law minor that can be taken with any undergraduate major.  Students are encouraged to participate in the Pre-Law Club, to ascertain the specific entrance requirements of the law school to which they intend to apply, and to seek out pre-law faculty advisor(s) early in their academic program.  SOCIAL SERVICE     Social service professions can be entered through a wide variety of liberal arts majors, particularly in the fields of social sciences and theology and religious studies.  While particular positions frequently require graduate study, many students acquire entry-level positions with a bachelor’s degree in conjunction with internship experiences.  The Bachelor of Science degree specifically prepares students for social service careers and advanced study in the social service fields.  Students interested in such careers should contact their faculty advisor. 39  COMMUNICATIONS AND PUBLIC RELATIONS  Rosemont has produced a number of accomplished writers and publishers as well as graduates who work in television, radio, and journalism.  Many graduates who have entered these fields, or who hold positions in public relations, have done so through a major or minor in English or in Communication.  English and Communication offer courses with practical experience and internship opportunities for undergraduate students.    GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION  Students preparing for careers in government work and/or public administration usually explore the psychological, social, political, historic, and economic aspects of society.  This knowledge is best combined with strong communication skills, which frequently include proficiency in a foreign language.  Exposure to management concepts, philosophy, and computer science may be an asset.  Entry into federal positions is by means of the Federal Service Entrance Examination or by political appointment.  Rosemont graduates have successfully entered this employment arena through both avenues.   BUSINESS FIELDS     Large numbers of Rosemont alumni enter the business world in various capacities.  While some of these are business majors, most are liberal arts majors whose human relations, writing, and critical thinking skills, combined with broad general knowledge, are avidly sought in the corporate sector.  At Rosemont, undergraduate business majors received something they may not even know they need—a business education founded in rigorous liberal –arts education.  This combination allows you to grow, adapt, and contribute as a citizen—and to build a successful career.  EDUCATION      Current undergraduate majors that offer teacher certification tracks in the Grade 7-12 span are:  Biology, Chemistry, English, History/Social Studies, and Mathematics. Spanish and Studio Art offer certification tracks in the Grade PK-12 span. Students must complete all requirements for the subject area major and take a series of education courses to prepare them to teach at the specific grade spans. Those choosing any of these subject areas will receive a baccalaureate degree in the subject area they choose and be eligible to apply for the specified certification with the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE).  The College reserves the right to change any requirements, at any time, in order to comply with Pennsylvania Department of Education requirements.  STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT  THE STUDENT ACADEMIC SUPPORT CENTER (SASC)       The Student Academic Support Center, located in the Brown Science Building, is Rosemont’s comprehensive resource for academic assistance.  Under the direction of the Director for Student Academic Support, the Center offers a wide range of advising and learning support services to enhance students' educational experiences at Rosemont College.  All of these services are available at no cost to Rosemont students.  The Student Academic Support Center offers academic support, learning supplementation, and enrichment for all students.  It includes the areas of advising, placement testing and tutorials. All students -traditional, non-traditional, and ESL students - are invited to visit the Center to discuss the ways in which the Center can best meet their specific needs.  Tutoring is offered in writing, reading, study skills, and other subjects across the curriculum.  Carefully selected tutors are available in combination with self-directed learning software.  A variety of academic workshops are also presented.  Students may schedule regular tutoring appointments or may simply drop in.  Faculty members are encouraged to refer students who they feel would benefit from the resources of the Student Academic Support Center.  ACADEMIC ADVISING     The Coordinators of Advising facilitate the ongoing process of communication between the student and their academic advisor.  Academic advising is essential for students to develop academically, emotionally, physically, and personally while experiencing college life at Rosemont.  The Coordinators provide advising support for conditionally accepted students, at-risk students, and those students who are undecided about their academic program.  The Coordinators can assist students with clarifying their educational goals, exploring academic and career options, managing their academic program, and course and degree selection.  Faculty academic advisors can then help students 40  successfully progress toward their academic, personal, and career goals.  Various forms are also available for students to initiate actions concerning their academic plan.  In addition, the Coordinators clarify academic policy for faculty, staff and students, as well as facilitates student-faculty relationships.  Each student will have an academic advisor with whom the student will work to identify areas of interest and to plan her/his academic program.  Once a student declares a major, the student is advised by a faculty member in the major field who helps her/him to plan and schedule her/his academic program.  Close contact with the advisor should be maintained at all times.  ADVISING FOR CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTED STUDENTS      The Coordinator of Advising and Director for Student Academic Support Center will work with each conditionally accepted student to design a special program of individualized academic support.  Failure to comply with the individualized program of academic support can lead to being on Academic Probation.  ADVISING FOR STUDENTS ON PROBATION  Students on Probation must fulfill all terms of the probation contract (usually known as an “Academic Action Plan”) and make arrangements to meet with a member of the advising staff in the Student Academic Support Center.  TESTING AND TUTORIALS    The Student Academic Support Center offers academic support, learning supplementation, and enrichment for the entire Rosemont College community.  To ensure that students' learning needs are met, standardized placement testing for first year students is conducted prior to course selection and registration.  This department also provides across-the-curriculum computer tutorials, audios, and videos, in addition to tutoring at no additional charge.  Tutoring is available to students who wish to improve performance or maintain high grades in a variety of subject areas through one-on-one sessions or in small groups.  Students may access tutoring by appointment or on a walk-in basis. Workshops on study skills, writing, and other academic topics are regularly scheduled during the semester.  The diverse learning needs of traditional, non-traditional, and ESL students are acknowledged in this multi-sensory educational environment. CENTER FOR POST GRADUATE SUCCESS  Career information and guidance are available to help all current students and alumni clarify their personal objectives and establish career goals which will enable them to fulfill their personal and professional potential.  Students are encouraged to begin planning in their first year by engaging in personal career counseling. Workshops offer interviewing skills, personalized résumé and cover letter writing techniques, and job search strategies.  The Government and Intercollegiate Career Fair sponsored by Cabrini, Neumann, and Rosemont Colleges and Eastern and Immaculata Universities is held annually. Each year, approximately sixty employers attend the fair to recruit for full-time, part-time and summer employment, and internship positions. Students are also encouraged to attend the annual Non-Profit and Government Fair co-sponsored by Rosemont College with 22 local colleges and universities.  Since study beyond the bachelor’s degree is required for some careers, information on graduate and professional school programs is maintained in the Office of Post Graduate Success; students are assisted with application procedures and graduate school workshops are offered.  In coordination with the Office of Post Graduate Success, Rosemont Alumni Relations provides students with the opportunity to connect with alumni in career fields where there is mutual interest. Students are urged to join the Alumni Mentoring Program to connect with alumni and engage in a meaningful professional experience.   Credentials for students and alumni pertaining to career placement are maintained by the Office of Post Graduate Success in accordance with the requirements of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended.  Internships, study abroad, research and service are also coordinated through this office.

Every Rosemont student is provided with a unique username and password to access their Moodle account. Students are auto-enrolled in Moodle, for their online and traditional courses, upon registration each semester. Moodle allows students to access course content, communicate with instructors and classmates, submit assignments, and obtain grades. The focus of the Moodle online learning platform is enhanced interaction and collaboration in a virtual classroom.  Students or faculty who experience problems with Moodle, should contact the Director of Online Learning or the Rosemont Help Desk (helpdesk@rosemont.edu).  TECHNOLOGY SERVICES     The Rosemont College Department of Information Technology supports the Mission of the College by integrating technology throughout the institution.  This vision recognizes the importance of information technology and multi-media as a means to enhance Rosemont’s commitment to excellence and joy in the pursuit of knowledge and dedication to educating women and men, 42  developing the strengths and abilities they require to respond to the needs and challenges of the times.  Key components include:  Rosemont iWay - http://iway.rosemont.edu The Rosemont iWay is the portal through which students access course information including registration, personal academic and financial aid information, billing and grades.

Computer labs in the Gertrude Kistler Memorial Library, the Science Building, and MAC lab in Lawrence Hall provide workspace for individual and collaborative use. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND HONESTY   Academic integrity is vital to the intellectual well-being of the Rosemont College community; it requires a spirit of scholarly cooperation, trust, and mutual respect.  Instances of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated.  Plagiarism is incompatible with academic study, is inexcusable in course work and is grounds for dismissal. The faculty is committed to the development of its students as scholars and participants in the academic and professional community. Evaluation of students' work is a means to foster this development. This evaluation process creates the implicit need for the student to acknowledge what is not original.  Any plagiarism or academic dishonesty demonstrates 43  not only a lack of academic integrity, but also a violation of the implied agreement that exists between students and faculty working as collaborators in the learning process.  ACADEMIC YEAR The traditional academic year (excluding an optional summer semester) consists of two semesters, each of which is approximately 15 weeks long.  Immediately after the last day of classes is a Reading Day, followed by final examinations.  ACADEMIC CREDIT The semester hour is the unit of academic credit for all courses offered during the fall, spring, and summer sessions.  For information regarding course credit, consult the schedule of classes for the current semester’s offerings on the iWay and the Registrar's Office.   CREDIT LOADS AND STUDENT SCHEDULES First semester first year students are limited to 15 credit hours, unless they are part of the Three-year Bachelor’s Degree program.  An exception can be granted to students taking a one-credit laboratory (Science) or a course with an experiential component (Art History).  No change may be made in a student’s schedule after the drop/add period for the semester.  Full tuition covers up to 18 credits of study per semester.  Students wishing to take 18 credits must maintain a GPA of 3.0000 or higher.  Students wishing to take more than 18 credits in a given semester must receive permission from the Academic Dean of the Undergraduate College and their major advisor.  They will be charged additional tuition and may incur additional fees.  A student on academic probation must complete an Academic Action Plan, attend regular tutoring and workshops, and should register and complete 15 credits to maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP).  Courses should be chosen in consultation with an advisor.  PRE-REGISTRATION With guidance from their academic advisor and the Student Academic Support Center, students choose courses for the following semester from the schedule prepared by the Office of the Registrar and posted on the IWay.  Pre-registration for the fall semester for currently enrolled students usually takes place in March; for the spring semester, in November.  Students who do not preregister by the preregistration deadline, will not be permitted to register until one (1) week prior to the start of the next semester.  Students who have not obtained faculty advisor approval during the pre-registration period will have their course selections deleted. Students that do not register, will be billed full-time tuition for the semester.  Entering first-year and new transfer students pre-register for the fall semester during the late spring or summer months and for the following spring semester during the fall semester preregistration period.  Students will work with SASC to select an appropriate schedule.  DROP/ADD PERIOD The drop/add period takes place at the start of each semester according to the dates published in the calendar and the hours indicated by the Registrar.  A student may drop or add a course only during the period indicated on the College calendar.  Students may drop and add courses via the iWay unless they are First Year students in their first semester.  First semester students must submit a drop/add form, signed by their faculty advisor, to the Office of the Registrar for processing.  A student wishing to withdraw from any course after the drop/add period must request a withdrawal from the course and submit the appropriate paperwork, including all required signatures to the Office of the Registrar within the appropriate time period.  Contracts for independent study or internships must be submitted on or before the registration day to the Registrar’s Office.  Required revisions must be submitted before the end of the drop/add period, as must signed forms to audit a course or to take a course for a pass/fail grade.   Late submissions will not be accepted.  GRADE POINT AVERAGE The standing of a student for each semester is determined by his/her grade point average (GPA).  Letter grades are given for individual courses and quality points are used to compute averages for each student at the end of each semester on both a semester and cumulative basis.  These averages are determined by multiplying the quality points for each course by the credit(s) for the course and dividing the sum of these products by the sum of 44  the credits they represent.  Pass and audit grades, as well as withdrawals, do not affect averages.  Courses completed at Cabrini College, Eastern University, Villanova University or SEPCHE schools under the Inter-Institutional Exchange Programs during the regularly scheduled fall and spring semesters are included in the computation of grade point averages.    A grade of F indicates that the student has failed the course.  If a failure is incurred in a required course, the course must be repeated.  A GPA of at least 2.0000 is required for graduation, and an average of at least 2.0000 is required in the major field.  A minimum 3.000 GPA is required for students who wish to participate in the Eastern University, Villanova University or SEPCHE schools Exchange Programs.    GRADE APPEAL POLICY Students are advised that grade appeals based on the quality of the work are tough to substantiate.  In addition to grades on papers, tests and quizzes, faculty may also factor attendance and class participation into grades.  It is important, that the student wishing to appeal a grade have as much supporting evidence to present as possible.  INFORMAL GRADE APPEAL PROCESS   Students who did not get the grade they were expecting for a class should first calculate their grade based on the formula published in the course syllabi.  If a discrepancy arises, the student should make an appointment to meet with the instructor within ten (working) days of the start of the next semester.  This is within the first two weeks of the spring semester for grades issued in the fall, and within two weeks of the start of the fall semester for grades issued in the spring.  If a student is appealing a grade issued for a half-semester course meeting in the first half of the semester, the appeal must take place within ten days of receiving the course grade.    After meeting with the student, if the instructor agrees that the grade was calculated incorrectly, a Change of Grade form should be filed by the faculty member with the Registrar’s Office.  If there is no discrepancy the faculty member should explain to the student why the grade issued is correct.    If a resolution cannot be reached, the appeal moves into the formal appeal process.  If a student requests a review of a grade issued by an adjunct instructor who is not teaching the next semester at the College the review will be led by the Discipline Coordinator or the Division Chair.    FORMAL GRADE APPEAL PROCESS   A good faith effort to resolve any academic grievance between a student and faculty member must precede any formal action. Students’ appeals of grades of D+, D, D-, or F that cannot be resolved informally proceed directly to the formal appeal process.  Students who wish to appeal a grade of C or higher must first present their case to the Academic Standards Committee.    TO APPEAL A GRADE OF C OR HIGHER   Students wishing to appeal a grade of C or higher that could not be resolved informally with the course instructor, must first submit their case in writing to the Academic Standards Committee within three weeks (15 working days) of the start of the semester after the semester in which they received the contested grade.  The student’s request must contain a signed letter stating why they are appealing the grade along with all supporting materials.  The Committee will contact the course instructor and ask for supporting materials the faculty member wishes to present.  If the Committee decides the case has merit, the grade appeal will proceed through the formal appeal process.  If the committee decides the case does not have merit the appeal cannot proceed.  The decision of the Committee is final.  The Committee will not comment on the appeal so as not to prejudice further actions.  If a member of Academic Standards is involved in the grade appeal that student must recuse themselves from participating in the Committee’s decision. Appeal requests that are submitted to the Committee after the third week of the semester will not be considered.  APPEALS OF D+, D, D- OR F GRADES   To begin the formal appeal process, the student must submit a signed letter to the faculty member with a copy to the Academic Dean of the Undergraduate College within three weeks (15 working days) of the start of the semester after the semester in which they received the contested grade stating why they wish to appeal the grade.  The exception to this is for those appeals that must first be presented to Academic Standards.  The student should submit all supporting materials to the Office of the Academic Dean.  The 45  Dean will ask the course instructor for all documentation on how the grade was calculated.  The Academic Dean will charge the respective Division Chair with reviewing all materials submitted and making a recommendation on the appeal within two weeks of receiving it.  If the decision of the Division Chair is not acceptable to either the student or the course instructor, the student should contact the Academic Dean and request that the Committee of Division Chairs review the case.  The Division Chairs can ask for materials other than those initially submitted by either the student or the faculty member if they believe it is necessary to rule a fair decision.  Division Chairs are also encouraged to meet with the student and faculty member.  The decisions of the Chairs will be stated in writing, addressed to the student and a copy sent to the course instructor.  If the decision of the Division Chairs is not acceptable to either the student or the course instructor, the student may request that the Academic Dean review all materials and render a decision.  The decision of the Dean is final and binding; there is no further appeal at this point.  If the course instructor is the Division Chair, the Dean will consult with the student and the course instructor to determine who the Dean will appoint to replace the Chair.   The right to proceed at each step or to stop this process is the prerogative of the student.  If the student withdraws the grievance, all records pertaining to the case will be expunged.  If at any point in this process the student is uncertain how to move this case forward, the student is advised to consult with his/her academic advisor.   GRADING SYSTEM     Grade Grade Points A 4.00    A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 B 3.00 B- 2.67 C+ 2.33 C 2.00 Minimal acceptable GPA for all  undergraduate courses.

When a required course is repeated, the following rules shall apply:  The repeated course must be equivalent to the previous course and must be taken at Rosemont.  Transfer credits do not qualify for grade forgiveness as the grade does not transfer.  The second time the course is taken it cannot be taken for Pass/Fail credit.  Both courses and grades will be recorded in the student’s file and transcript.  When a student repeats a course, only the highest grade earned will be used to calculate the student’s cumulative grade point average.  The lower grade(s) will be forgiven in the final calculation of the student’s GPA.  The original grade and quality points will remain on the transcript, listed with all courses taken in a particular year and semester.  All 46  instances of a course and all grades earned will appear on the student’s transcript.   If a grade is replaced in the calculation of the cumulative GPA, the forgiven grade will be marked with an Asterisk (*) on the transcript and the higher grade will be marked with an “R” for Repeated.  A student who has failed a course, or has received a grade of F for a course taken at Villanova University, Eastern University or SEPCHE schools, may repeat the equivalent course at Rosemont or at the other SEPCHE institutions.  If a student chooses to repeat a course at an institution other than Rosemont College, the policy for repeating a course at that institution applies.  Courses that are repeated to improve a grade are counted in Attempted Credits but only the one higher grade is counted in the Total Earned Credits.  Students with repeated courses on their academic record should carefully monitor their progress towards graduation. REMEDIAL COURSES     Credits and grades earned for remedial courses are calculated in the semester credits earned and the semester GPA.  Credits earned for remedial courses are calculated in the Cumulative GPA but are NOT counted in the overall credits earned for graduation.  An example of a remedial course currently in the curriculum is  Biochemistry I 3  Biochemistry I 3       Biochemistry I 3        CREDITS Biochemistry Minor Requirements      24       Biochemistry I 3 "
RDG 0050," “Reading and Study Skills for the Successful Student.”   Remedial courses are normally courses numbered below the 0100 level.  Remedial courses are counted in the credit hours needed for full time status.  Full time status is determined by enrollment in a minimum of 12 credits per semester.  Students should check with the office of Financial Aid to determine if repeating a course may impact financial aid eligibility.  INCOMPLETE GRADES (I)    When a student has a serious reason that prevents the completion of course requirements (e.g., medical issues, family problems, work-related travel), the student must submit written documentation (from a physician, counselor, or employer) and request that the instructor assign a grade of “I” (Incomplete).  The student must initiate and document the request on or before the final class meeting of the semester/session.  If the instructor decides to grant the request, s/he must first obtain the Academic Dean’s approval on the appropriate form.  The student must complete and submit all remaining course work and assignments as quickly as possible; the instructor must then submit a Change of Grade form directly to the Office of the Registrar.  Any grade of “I” that is assigned during the fall semester must be resolved no later than the following May 15; any grade of “I” that is assigned during the spring must be resolved no later than the following September 15; any grade of “I” that is assigned during the summer must be resolved no later than the following January 15.  In any case where these deadlines are not met, the “I” will automatically become an “F;” grade appeals or additional time extensions will not be granted.  Students and instructors are advised that grades of “I” may adversely affect the student’s financial aid eligibility and/or academic standing.  TEMPORARY GRADES (T)    Students in the UC can request an extension of time to complete course requirements by requesting a grade of “T” (Temporary).  This request is limited to no more than one course in a given semester; under certain circumstances the Undergraduate College Academic Dean can grant an exemption and allow a student more than one “T” grade.  The student and the instructor must complete all information on the “T” grade form and the instructor must submit the form to the Office of the Academic Dean.  Forms will not be accepted from students.  The student must complete and submit all remaining course work and assignments as quickly as possible; the instructor must then submit a Change of Grade Form.  Any grade of “T” that is not satisfactorily resolved within four (4) weeks of the final class meeting of the semester will automatically become an “F”.  Grade appeals or additional time extensions will not be granted.  “T” grades may not be changed to grades of “I” (Incomplete), and all grades of “T” in courses that serve as pre-requisites must be satisfactorily resolved before the student begins work in a subsequent course.  47  Students are advised that grades of “T”, “W” (withdrawal) and “F” (failing) can negatively impact their financial aid.    PASS/FAIL OPTION     The pass/fail option, open to full-time students with a minimum 2.0000 cumulative average, is intended to encourage students to broaden their program of study by the pursuit of elective courses offered outside their major and general programs.  A course elected under the pass/fail option is taken for credit and the student must fulfill all obligations of the course.  The student’s record at the end of the semester indicates for this course either pass or fail, instead of a letter grade.  A failure is included in the grade point average.  The pass/fail option must be approved by the instructor by the end of the drop/add period. No more than two (2) courses can be taken pass/fail.  MID-TERM GRADE REPORTS AND EARLY WARNING SYSTEM    In the Undergraduate College, students receive Mid-term Grades indicating satisfactory (grade of S), marginally satisfactory (grade of S-), or unsatisfactory (grade of U) work to date.  In addition, they may also receive warnings from their faculty through the Undergraduate College Early Warning System, which provides greater feedback to students about their progress in classes.  Students who receive grades of S- or U or warnings from faculty are encouraged to meet with staff in the Student Academic Support Center to seek academic support as warranted.  Students can view mid-term grades on the iWay.  Mid-term grades are not part of a student’s transcript.  GRADE REPORTS     Grade reports will be available to students on the iWay at the end of each semester.   TRANSCRIPTS      Students may obtain transcripts of their academic records from the Office of the Registrar.  Requests can be made in person or by submitting an online request, located on the Registrar’s web page.  Transcript requests are typically fulfilled within 3 business days.  Official transcripts are available to be sent electronically as a secured PDF or as a paper transcript on security paper.  Transcripts will not be released for students whose financial accounts have not been cleared by Student Accounts and Financial Aid.  COURSE EXAMINATIONS    In most courses, examinations are given periodically throughout the semester, with a major examination given at the end of the semester.  Final examinations given at the end of the course are scheduled by the Registrar within the published examination period.  CREDIT BY EXAMINATION    Rosemont College students may challenge certain courses in consultation with their major advisor. The intent of Rosemont's credit by examination policy is to provide students who have acquired competence through special learning situations, such as professional experience or independent study, with the opportunity to demonstrate their competence.  Students who can demonstrate mastery of course content through satisfactory performance (at least a grade of C) on a departmentally-prepared examination earn credit for the course after having paid the examination fee.  The course will be listed on the student’s transcript as transfer credit and does not count towards full-time status for the semester the exam is taken, the appropriate credit value will be posted but a grade will not be entered.    Requirements:  Students must be full-time and in good standing.  Students may challenge a maximum of 2 courses towards their undergraduate degree.   Students may not challenge a course which is a prerequisite for a course they have already taken or is at a lower level than what they have placed into or taken (previously or currently).   Students may not challenge a course they have already received credit for at Rosemont or another institution.  Students may not challenge a course they have failed, withdrawn from, have an incomplete in, or for a credit by exam they previously did not pass.  Students must pay for the exam prior to taking the exam.  The fee covers the cost of creating and administering the exam and is due regardless of the student passing the exam.  Developmental courses cannot be challenged.  This option is only available during the fall and spring semesters. 48  Procedure: 1. The student should meet with their advisor to discuss the possibility of challenging a course through credit by exam.  If recommended, the student must complete the credit by exam form.  The exam must be taken in the same semester and prior to the end of classes for that semester. 2. The student must pay the credit by exam fee (current fee available from Student Accounts) and return the form to the Registrar’s Office prior to taking the exam. 3. After the student takes the exam on the exam date, the Faculty member administering the exam will report the grade to the Registrar’s office within 48 hours of the exam date. 4. If the exam was successful (C or better), transfer credit will be posted for the course challenged. WITHDRAWAL FROM COURSES    Students in the Undergraduate College may withdraw from a course until the deadline published by the Office of the Registrar for each semester/session.  Generally, this deadline is set one month prior to the last date of class.  Students must complete the appropriate Withdrawal form that can be found on the iWay or through the Student Academic Support Center, and obtain all required signatures.  The student will receive a grade of “W,” which will not be calculated into the student’s GPA.  Students are advised that grades of “W” may adversely affect the student’s financial aid eligibility and/or academic standing.  ATTENDANCE POLICY     In the Undergraduate College at Rosemont College, regular class attendance is essential to successful academic achievement.    Absences are permitted only in cases of illness or other legitimate causes (family emergency, death in the family, etc.).  Official notice that a student has presented documentation for an absence is sent from the Office of the Dean of Students to faculty on a timely basis.  In cases of an documented absence from a class, the student has both the opportunity and responsibility to make up all class work missed.  Faculty members have the discretion whether or not to accept work from or schedule make-up exams or quizzes for students who miss a class without a legitimate excuse.  Students are allowed to miss the equivalent of one week of classes for any course in which they are enrolled.  This amounts to three absences for a class that meets on MWF schedule, two classes for courses meeting either on a TR or MW schedule, and one class for labs and classes that meet only once a week.  Absences are counted from the first day of class.  Late registrants will have absences accrued beginning the first class meeting after they register.  NOTE -- Students with a hold from the Business Office are expected to attend the class in which they expect to enroll from the first day of the semester.  Excessive absences will affect students’ grades in courses.  The grade penalty for a course is defined on the syllabus and is determined by the faculty member teaching the course.  The U.S. Department of Education requires that all faculty must maintain detailed attendance records showing the student’s last date of attendance in a course.  Faculty have the option of submitting an “FX” grade to students who failed the course due to excessive absences.  The FX grade is calculated as an “F” in the student’s grade point average.  For students receiving financial aid, failure from non-attendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of their financial aid.  Faculty are required to provide the date when the student last attended.  While faculty, student organizations, and the  must complete that course prior to enrolling.  HIS  0111 - THE RISE OF MEDIEVAL KINGDOMS Credits:  3 This course is an exploration of the history of Western Civilization during the Middle Ages.

ACT 101," Grant Program are strongly encouraged to schedule field trips and on-campus events so that they do not conflict with class students may be enrolled in, this may not always be possible.  If a class absence is necessary because of an activity being held in another course, the faculty member teaching that course will provide the Academic Dean with a list of participants in advance of the activity, and the Academic Dean’s Office will verify this absence.  The  Director will also follow this procedure.  If the absence is due to an activity of a college-sponsored club or organization, the notification will come from the Dean of Student’s Office.  Students are not allowed more than one absence per semester due to a conflict with an activity sponsored by another 49  course or a college organization. This absence is in addition to those allowed above.  If faculty members can document that a student scheduled to attend an event or a field trip has missed too many classes, or if they are giving an exam or quiz that day, the student should attend class and not the outside activity.  In that case, the faculty member teaching the course will notify the Academic Dean or the Dean of Students that the absence request has been denied.    If a student must be absent due to serious injury or illness, or due to pregnancy, for more than two weeks, they are strongly encouraged to take a leave of absence for the semester during which the illness, injury, pregnancy, or birth of the child occurs.  Students should follow the Leave of Absence policy and provide the needed documentation.  Students are also encouraged to meet with the Financial Aid Office as extended absences and leaves can affect aid.  STUDENT ATHLETES     The Athletic Department is committed to consistent class attendance and participation in classes by Rosemont’s student-athletes.   Recognizing that student-athletes will occasionally miss class due to athletic competition, the Athletic Director will prepare official travel notices for each team, outlining the dates that athletes will miss classes due to scheduled competitions.   These will be issued at the beginning of each semester and be sent by the Athletic Director directly to the faculty.    In the event that a game has been cancelled or rescheduled, the Athletic Director will notify faculty.  The Director will notify faculty if a student is no longer a member of a team, regardless of whether they quit or was asked to leave.    The Athletic Director will also notify faculty of students who become academically ineligible during the academic year.  Students who are no longer academically eligible cannot attend events as a member of the team and are required to attend class.  Student-athletes have the responsibility to make themselves known to the professors teaching their classes.  They are responsible for making up all class work missed due to athletic participation.  They must communicate directly with their professors.  The professor should set the date for make-up exams and quizzes, and for assignments to be completed and turned in.  These dates should be communicated in writing to the student.  NOTE: Rosemont student-athletes are not allowed to miss class to attend practices, fund raisers, picture taking sessions, etc.  If a student-athlete must be absent due to injury or hospitalization that arises from competition or practice, the Athletic Director will notify faculty and the Dean of Students.  Verification from the physician or hospital, documenting the injury, will be provided to the Dean of Students when the student-athlete returns to campus.   It is the student’s responsibility to follow-up with each professor to arrange for completing all make-up work upon his/her return to campus.  If a student must be absent due to serious injury for more than two weeks, they are strongly encouraged to take a leave of absence for the semester in which the injury occurs.  Students should follow the Leave of Absence policy and provide the needed documentation.  Students are also encouraged to meet with the Financial Aid Office as extended absences and leaves can affect aid.  LEAVE OF ABSENCE     Rosemont College acknowledges that under some circumstances, students may have to interrupt their studies at the College.  Students who are in good academic standing and who plan to return to Rosemont College can request a leave of absence for medical reasons, financial difficulties, or personal/family issues, not to exceed two consecutive semesters.  The exception is for students on active military service who may request a leave of absence for up to two years.  International students cannot request a leave of absence unless they will be out of the country, and have obtained prior permission from the International Student Coordinator.  Students must take a least one full semester on leave, however, if a student takes a leave during the first three weeks of a semester, that semester will be considered a full semester away.  Students studying abroad do not need to obtain a leave of absence as they remain registered with the College.  Students enrolled in the Undergraduate College initiate the request for a leave of absence by obtaining the Leave of Absence Form from the Student Academic Support Center.  A Leave of 50  Absence must be requested before or during the semester when the student wants the leave to start.  Only under extraordinary circumstances will the College consider granting a retroactive leave.  The decision to retroactively begin a leave is at the discretion of the Academic Dean.  Before any leave request can be considered, the student must provide all required information on the Form, including the reason(s) for requesting the leave, the appropriate documentation requested on the form, as well as the anticipated date of return to Rosemont College.  In addition, before leave can be granted the student is responsible for settling all outstanding balances with the College.  Upon verification of the materials submitted, students enrolled in the Undergraduate College are notified in writing by the Director of the Student Academic Support Center if their leave has been approved.  Students must keep the Registrar’s office apprised of their mailing address and must meet the College’s deadlines for registration, housing reservations, financial aid applications, etc. for the semester or term in which they plan to return.  Students on leave are responsible for all arrangements with these offices on campus.  Undergraduate College students should be aware that financial aid, scholarships and housing do not automatically carry over.  Students are also asked to give the appropriate Dean’s Office one month’s notice that they will re-enroll so they have access to registration materials.    Students returning from leave on schedule do not have to reapply to the College.  Students who do not return after two (2) semesters are automatically withdrawn from Rosemont College and must formally reapply for admission.    WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COLLEGE   No student will be considered officially withdrawn as a student and eligible for appropriate refunds or deposits until the withdrawal procedure has been completed.  The student must initiate the process with the Student Academic Support and include an official request to withdraw, a personal interview, and complete an online exit survey.  It is also necessary for the student withdrawing (resident or commuter) to meet with the Office of Financial Aid to discuss loan repayment   If withdrawing during the middle of a semester, the student will receive withdraw (W) grades in all classes and will be responsible for any charges incurred for that semester.  Based on the date of the withdraw, financial aid may have to be adjusted and returned resulting in a higher balance.  Students withdrawing for the current semester, must complete the withdrawal process prior to the last day of classes of that semester.   Students withdrawing after the end of the semester for a future semester, will automatically be dropped from their upcoming classes.  All College identification, keys, and property must be returned before the withdrawal procedure can be completed.  The student is responsible for any outstanding charges on their account and for completing Federal loan exit counseling before transcripts will be released.  ACADEMIC PROBATION     The academic records of students are reviewed by the Academic Standards Committee of the Undergraduate College faculty at the conclusion of the fall and spring semesters.    Students are placed on Academic Probation for the following reasons:  First year students and new transfer students whose GPA is less than 2.0000 and greater than 0.5000   All other students whose GPA is less than 2.0000 for a given semester  Students whose semester GPA is at or above 2.0000, but whose cumulative GPA is less than 2.0000, are continued on probation. Being placed on academic probation is meant to serve as a warning that the student’s academic work is unsatisfactory and that definite improvement is necessary to continue at the College.  While on probation, students are restricted to 15 credit hours per semester.  Student are required to meet with staff in the Student Academic Support Center to set up an Academic Action Plan and to attend weekly tutoring sessions for their classes.  Failure to do so will be noted should students find themselves in further academic difficulty.  Being placed on academic probation can affect financial aid.  Students are encouraged to meet with the staff in the Financial Aid Office to discuss their particular situation.  51  The College reserves the right to dismiss any student who is not in good academic standing (at least a 2.000 cumulative GPA), whose conduct has been found to be in violation of College policies and procedures, or whose continuance would be detrimental to his/ her own health or to the health and well-being of others.    Academic dismissal with right of appeal can be made for the following reasons:  First year students and new transfer students whose GPA is 0.5000 or less after one semester  Students whose semester GPA is less than 2.0000 for two consecutive semesters   As part of their appeal students are also required to present an Academic Action Plan, prepared with the assistance of the Student Academic Support Center.    Failure to include an Academic Action Plan will result in the appeal being considered incomplete and will not be reviewed by Academic Standings. Student appeals of their dismissal from the college must be received by the Academic Dean’s Office no later than that appeal deadline stated in the letter or email from the Dean’s Office notifying them of their dismissal.  Late submissions of appeals will not be accepted.  Students are advised that academic reinstatement does not affect the suspension of their financial aid.  Students must appeal loss of their financial aid separately.  Academic dismissal without the right of appeal can be made for the following reason:  Students readmitted on appeal who do not maintain a semester GPA of 2.0000  Student who were below a 2.0000 for more than 2 semesters  A semester GPA below a .500 in a semester other than their first semester at Rosemont College.

Internship Expenses Student interns who reside on-campus pay full room and board, and tuition and fees for the Rosemont credits earned in the internship, if any. Student interns who reside off-campus pay full tuition for the Rosemont credits earned in the internship.  Tuition Refund Policy Since College commitments are made on the basis of student enrollments, full tuition will not be refunded after the payment due date. Should a student choose to withdraw, drop below full-time status, or take a leave of absence after registration and before the completion of the second week of classes, a refund not exceeding 80% of the tuition may be requested. No refunds will be given after the second week of classes. Title IV recipients are subject to the Title IV refund policy. The date of withdrawal, drop, or leave of absence is determined as being the time the Director of the Student Academic Support Center receives written notice from the student.  Undergraduate College Tuition Refund Policy A student who withdraws from semester-length classes may be entitled to a refund according to the schedule listed below.  Fees are not refundable, except for those classes that have been canceled by the College or for students who have withdrawn before the first day of classes.  The date of a Drop/Add or Withdrawal is determined by the records of the Office of the Registrar, not the date the student stops attending class. The percentage of tuition to be refunded to the student is as follows:  Students who withdraw before the first day of classes will receive 100% refund of tuition.  Students who withdraw during the first and second weeks of a new semester will receive 80% refund of tuition.  Students who withdraw during the third week of a new semester will receive 50% refund of tuition.  Students who withdraw during the fourth week of a new semester will receive 20% refund of tuition No refunds will be issued to students that withdraw after the fourth week of class.       The first scheduled meeting of a class constitutes the beginning of the refund period for that class.  The refund period may change based upon the length or nature of the class.  Refunds are determined by the Business Office only.  Financial aid is adjusted accordingly with regard to the number of credits that have been dropped.  If a student withdraws, or if a credit balance results from financial aid awards or student overpayment, a refund may be expected in the mail within a timely manner.  Refunds for Dropped Classes in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies A student who drops a class prior to the first scheduled meeting of a class may be entitled to a 56  full refund if the class is formally dropped.  If a student drops a class prior to the second scheduled meeting of a class, they will be entitled to an 80% refund if the class is formally dropped.  If a class is dropped after the second scheduled meeting of a class, the student is not entitled to a refund.  The date of a drop is determined by the records of the Office of the Registrar, not the date the student stops attending class.  The refund period may change based upon the length or nature of the class.  For example, Turbo classes must be dropped prior to the first scheduled class meeting.  Please Note:  financial aid is adjusted accordingly with regard to the number of credits that have been dropped.  If you are an undergraduate student and you drop below 6 credit hours for the semester, all of your aid may have to be returned.  If you are a graduate student and you drop below 4.5 credit hours for the semester, all of your aid may have to be returned.  It is advisable that you consult with the Financial Aid Officer regarding the ramifications of dropping a class.   Withdrawals If a student withdraws from a class after the drop/add period, the student is not entitled to a refund and is also financially obligated for cost of the class.  DEPOSIT POLICY     First-Year and Transfer Students Once an applicant is accepted to the College, a $350 enrollment deposit ($200 for commuters) is required to guarantee enrollment and a place in the residence halls.

FINANCIAL AID      Rosemont College is committed to helping all qualified students afford a Rosemont education.  Financial assistance is available to degree-seeking students or students seeking certain graduate certificates who are United States citizens or eligible non-citizens and who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis. Financial aid may consist of scholarships, grants, loans, employment, or any combination of these programs.  Financial aid awards are made for one year only.  A student must re-apply for financial aid each year to continue receiving federal, state, and institutional funds.  Financial aid eligibility is reviewed every year and is subject to changes in family financial conditions, federal and state regulations, and/or Rosemont College policies.  In addition, students must maintain satisfactory academic progress.  For specific information regarding the availability of need based financial aid, please contact the Financial Aid Office at 610.520-3115.  For information about merit scholarships for traditional undergraduate students, new applicants should contact the Office of Admissions at 610.527.0200 ext. 2966.   Students wishing to be considered for any form of financial aid MUST complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) by the required deadline each year.  The FAFSA deadline for priority review is April 15 (February 15 for admitted students).  Verification Policy Approximately one third of FAFSA filers are selected for verification.  A requirement of the U.S. Department of Education, verification is the process of confirming information submitted on the FAFSA.  Students are responsible for submitting requested information to complete the verification process before the semester begins.  Federal student aid will remain estimated and will not be credited to the student’s account until verification is complete.  Additionally, students awarded Federal Work Study may not begin employment until verification is complete.    57  Items to be verified include: Adjusted Gross Income, U.S. income tax paid, number of family members in the household, the number of family members enrolled in post-secondary schools at least half time, untaxed income, and any other conflicting information.    Students are notified in writing by the Financial Aid Office of the documents needed to complete verification, and the following documents are those generally required to complete the process:  Student’s federal income tax return transcript from the prior year   Parents’ federal income tax return transcript from prior year (for dependent students)   Spouse’s income tax return transcript for prior year (for married independent students)   Verification worksheet  Additional documents upon request Students are encouraged to utilize the IRS data retrieval tool on the FAFSA as a part of the verification process. If students and parents are able to successfully download their tax information from the IRS into the FAFSA and submit with changes, the tax documents listed above will be waived and the verification worksheet only is required.   Upon receipt of the verification documents, the school will compare the information on the submitted documents with that on the FAFSA.  If discrepancies are revealed, the school will make the corrections, which could result in a change in aid eligibility.  The school will notify the student in writing of any changes in eligibility due to verification within one week of completing the verification process.  The school will cease processing federal student aid for students who fail to submit the required verification documents before the deadline.  If a student is selected for verification after federal student aid funds have already disbursed, the school will withhold all future disbursements of federal student aid until verification is complete.  If verification results in the student’s ineligibility for aid that has been previously disbursed, then the student is responsible for repaying aid for which they are not eligible.  The school will notify the student in writing requesting full payment of the overpayment of ineligible aid.  Any student in an overpayment status who fails to repay the overpayment or make satisfactory repayment arrangements will be reported to the U.S. Department of Education and/or to the National Student Loan Data System  (NSLDS) and remain ineligible for further federal student aid until the overpayment is resolved.   Satisfactory Academic Progress In order to be eligible for federal student aid, a student must be making Satisfactory Academic Progress toward degree completion requirements.  Federal regulations require schools to monitor academic progress annually or more frequently to ensure each student is meeting minimum qualitative and quantitative standards.  Any student not meeting either of these minimum standards at the time of evaluation will become ineligible and will remain ineligible for federal student aid until both standards are again met.  In accordance with federal regulations, Rosemont College’s policy is to monitor academic progress for students in the Undergraduate College at the end of the spring semester.  Academic progress for students in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies is measured at the end of the spring semester as well. In order to be making Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must have a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 (qualitative standard) for undergraduates or 3.0 for students enrolled in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies.  A student must also have passed at least 75% of the credits attempted (quantitative standard).  Any courses with a grade of “W” or “I” will count as classes not successfully passed.  Any transfer credits shall count as credits attempted and completed but will not impact the grade point average standard.  These academic progress standards apply even for semesters in which a student did not receive federal student aid.  Students who fail to meet the minimum standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress will be notified in writing by the Financial Aid Office and their financial aid will be suspended.  Students who fail to meet the academic progress standard may submit an appeal with the Financial Aid Office prior to the start of the next academic semester.  The appeal form is available electronically at:  http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/1696429/SAP-Appeal 58    Appeals should specify mitigating circumstances, such as illness or death in the family that prevented the student from achieving satisfactory academic progress.    The Financial Aid Office may request additional documentation to support the appeal.   The student will be notified in writing of the outcome of the appeal.  If the appeal is granted the student will be placed in a status of financial aid probation for one semester.  The student may also be required to complete an Academic Action Plan with the student academic support center (undergraduates) or student services (graduate and professional studies students) if it is determined it is not possible for the student to meet the qualitative and quantitative standards to make Satisfactory Academic Progress after just one semester’s coursework.   If the appeal is denied the student will remain ineligible until both standards are met Students will also become ineligible for aid if they have not graduated within completing 150% of the required hours needed to complete their program as defined in the Rosemont College Handbook.  Return of Title IV Funds Policy The Financial Aid Office is required by federal statute to recalculate federal financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term. The federal Title IV financial aid programs must be recalculated in these situations.   If a student leaves the institution prior to completing 60% of a payment period or term, the financial aid office recalculates eligibility for Title IV funds. Recalculation is based on the percentage of earned aid using the following Federal Return of Title IV funds formula: Percentage of payment period or term completed = the number of days completed up to the withdrawal date divided by the total days in the payment period or term. (Any break of five days or more is not counted as part of the days in the term.) This percentage is also the percentage of earned aid.  Funds are returned to the appropriate federal program based on the percentage of unearned aid using the following formula:  Aid to be returned = (100% of the aid that could be disbursed minus the percentage of earned aid) multiplied by the total amount of aid that could have been disbursed during the payment period or term.  If a student earned less aid than was disbursed, the institution would be required to return a portion of the funds and the student would be required to return a portion of the funds. When Title IV funds are returned, the student borrower may owe a debit balance to the institution.  If a student earned more aid than was disbursed to him/her, the institution would owe the student a post-withdrawal disbursement which must be paid within 120 days of the student's withdrawal.  The institution must return the amount of Title IV funds for which it is responsible no later than 45 days after the date of the determination of the date of the student’s withdrawal.  Refunds are allocated in the following order:  Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loans  Subsidized Federal Stafford Loans  Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans  Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans  Federal PLUS Loans   Direct PLUS Loans  Federal Pell Grants for which a return of funds is required  Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants for which a return of funds is required   FEDERAL AND STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS      Federal and state financial aid programs are available to students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis.  Eligibility is based on financial need, and in some cases, may be limited depending on fund availability.  Students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to apply for federal and state aid.   59  Federal Pell Grant–an entitlement program funded by the federal government; the amount of the award is determined by the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) from the FAFSA.   Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant (FSEOG)–part of the campus-based aid programs funded by the federal government; grants are awarded to students with exceptional financial need, with first preference to federal Pell Grant recipients.  Federal Direct Loan–The maximum amount a student can borrow is determined by his or her grade level. First year students can borrow up to $5,500; second year students can borrow up to $6,500; and third and fourth year students can borrow up to $7,500 for the academic year. The annual loan limits include $2,000 Unsubsidized Direct Loan eligibility per academic year. Independent students may be able to borrow additional Unsubsidized Direct Loan in addition to the base loan amounts. Independent students may be able to borrow up to an additional $4,000 Unsubsidized Direct Loan for the first and second academic year and up to an additional $5,000 for the third and fourth academic year. Dependent students whose parents are denied the PLUS can borrow at the same loan limits as independent students. The amount of Direct Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan listed on the financial aid award letter is the gross amount. The government charges a loan processing fee of 1.066% for loans first disbursed on after October 1, 2018 and before October 1, 2019 or 1.069% on or after October 1, 2017 and before October 1, 2018 on Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct Loans.   The Direct PLUS loan fees are 4.248% for loans first disbursed on or after October 1, 2018 and before October 1, 2019 or 4.264% on or after October 1, 2017 and before October 1, 2018.The net amount of the loans will be reflected on your student bill.  Interest Rates for Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2018 and before July 1, 2019 is $5.05% for undergraduate Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized loans, 6.6% for graduate and professional Direct Unsubsidized loans and 7.6% for Direct PLUS loans.   Federal Work Study-campus employment and some off-campus community service positions are available to a limited number of students with financial need.  An award listed is an eligibility indicator; students will need to apply for consideration for a position.  Positions are competitive and eligibility as listed on a financial aid award letter is not a guarantee of the ability to secure a position.   State Grant-grant funds awarded to undergraduate students based on eligibility according to each state’s guidelines. For Pennsylvania residents, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be processed before May 1 for full consideration for a PHEAA Grant.  Students receiving a PHEAA Grant must pass at least 24 credits during each academic year that a full-time state grant award is received in order to make academic progress for future state grant awards. Students must also be enrolled in at least 50% of their coursework on site versus online or they could receive a reduced grant.   Students receiving a grant from a state other than Pennsylvania should check with their state agency regarding academic requirements for renewal and to see if it is transferrable to Pennsylvania.

INDEPENDENT STUDY POLICY    The Independent Study option is afforded only under the circumstance that in a student’s final year of study a degree requirement course is unavailable at any Rosemont location or online, or because the course was cancelled due to low enrollment.  Students registered for courses cancelled due to low enrollment must first consider taking an alternative course offered at any Rosemont location or online prior to requesting independent study.  Independent study options are not made available because of location preference, for medical reasons, or travel, nor to accommodate a more rapid progression through the program. Requests for independent study should be made through the director of the program and require approval of the Dean of Graduate and Professional Studies at least three weeks prior to the start of the session, unless the request is made due to cancellation of a course. Start and end dates for independent study courses adhere to the session calendar.  Eligible students may submit, for review and approval by the Program Director, a written plan for Independent Study that extends their academic and professional work in a direction that program coursework cannot provide.   Independent Study plans may not substantially duplicate the content of an existing course, and students must obtain the cooperation of an appropriate faculty supervisor. Independent Study is open only to matriculated students in good academic standing (GPA of 3.00 or higher).  Eligible students may earn a maximum of six (6) credit hours in an Independent Study format. The Independent Study request form is available from the Program Director. Permission to take Independent Study is at the full discretion of the Program Director.   FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)  What is FERPA?  FERPA requires that federally funded institutions, under programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education, comply with certain procedures with regard to disclosing and maintaining educational records. FERPA was not enacted to preclude the disclosure of educational records simply because the records identify a student by name; rather, it was designed to protect the student’s educational information and status as a student. Parents should understand that their rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a postsecondary school at any age.  Who is a student? According to FERPA, a student is an individual who is enrolled in and actually attends an educational institution. The regulations provide that attendance includes, but is not limited to, attendance in person or by correspondence. Individuals who “attend” classes but are not physically located on a campus are also students, thus including those who attend classes by video conference, satellite, Internet, or other electronic information and telecommunications technologies.  FERPA prohibits the disclosure of a student’s “protected information” to a third party. This disclosure is prohibited whether it is made by hand delivery, verbally, fax, mail, or electronic transmission. Disclosure also includes the 65  provision of access to the educational institution’s career center database of student resumes.  What information is protected? FERPA classifies protected information into three categories: educational information, personally identifiable information (PII) and directory information. The limitations imposed by FERPA vary with respect to each category.  Personally identifiable information can only be disclosed if the educational institution obtains the signature of the student on a document specifically identifying the information to be disclosed, the reason for the disclosure, and the parties to whom the disclosure will be made. Examples of PII include: student’s name, date of birth, student ID or SSN, and other information which can be used to distinguish an individual’s identity in relation to academic records.   Educational information cannot be disclosed without prior approval of the student. FERPA defines “education records” as “records, files, documents, and other materials” that are “maintained by an educational agency or institution, or by a person acting for such agency or institution.” This includes transcripts, GPA, grades, social security number, and academic evaluations, and records that pertain to an individual’s previous attendance as a student of an institution.  Directory information can be disclosed by the institution without consent. Directory information is defined as “information contained in an education record of a student that would not generally be considered harmful or an invasion of privacy if disclosed.” This includes such items as a list of students’ names, addresses, and telephone numbers, and also includes a student ID number (which includes electronic identifiers) provided it cannot be used to gain access to education records. Directory information, however, does not include a student’s social security number nor can the social security number be used to confirm directory information. If a student decides to “opt out” of the disclosure of directory information, the “opt out” continues indefinitely.  What does the release cover? Rosemont College cannot provide information about a student’s academic records, including performance in a class, grades, or registrations to a third party without written consent by the student. Information will only be provided after the identity of the third party is verified. Student can revoke FERPA consent at any time.  FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE  TUITION, FEES AND FINANCIAL AID   Payment Plans Rosemont offers a payment plan to qualified students. Through this program, tuition can be extended over a period of time, rather than being paid in one sum at the beginning of each semester. For more information, contact the Office of Student Accounts. Financial Obligations All financial obligations must be met prior to the start of the semester or session in which they are incurred, unless other arrangements have been made through the Accounting Office. Transcripts will not be released for students with outstanding financial obligations. Students with outstanding financial obligations will be refused permission to register until their obligations are satisfied. For graduating students, all costs incurred at Rosemont College must be paid in full before graduation. Direct all questions about bills or billing to the Office of Student Accounts.  Receipts and Verification of Payment All requests for receipts or other verification of payment should be made to the Office of Student Accounts. Receipts will be forwarded directly to the student's home address.  All requests for receipts must be made at the time that payment is made. If a request for a receipt is not made at the time of payment, it will be assumed that no receipt is required. A fee is charged when a receipt is requested at a time other than at the time of payment, including requests for duplicate receipts.  Neither the Office of the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies nor the Registrar’s Office can verify that payment has been received; only the Accounting Office can verify payment.  Tuition and Fees Current tuition and fees are available in the Office of the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies and on the Rosemont College website (www.rosemont.edu).  Students make payments in the Student Accounts Office with check, cash or money orders. Payments can also be made on the I-Way and Cash 66  net, Mastercard, Visa, Amex and Discover, also with an Electronic Check. There is a 2.75 percent charge if students use credit cards on the iWay to make a payment. This is a charge from the credit card company not the college.  FINANCIAL AID POLICY     Students in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies wishing to apply for financial assistance should complete a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) either online at www.fafsa.ed.gov or by mailing a paper form which can be obtained from most libraries, high schools, or colleges. The Rosemont College code is 003360. The government will provide a Student Aid Report within approximately three weeks, which will outline the student’s eligibility for federal loan and grant programs. On receipt of this form, the student should contact the Office of Financial Aid.  Matriculated undergraduate Professional Studies students who are enrolled in a degree-granting program of study, and who are pursuing at least half-time coursework (a minimum of six credits per academic semester), are eligible to apply for tuition assistance in the form of federal Stafford Loans. Since there are three or more undergraduate Professional Studies sessions per academic semester, this means  Professional Studies undergraduate students must take at least six credits during the fall (Sessions 51, 52 and 53), six in the spring (Sessions 51, 52 and 53) and six in the Summer (Sessions 51, 52 and 53) to maintain eligibility for Stafford loans. Non-matriculated students should explore alternative financing options with the Office of Financial Aid at (610) 527 0200, Ext. 2221.  Matriculated graduate Professional Studies sudents who are enrolled in a degree-granting program of study, and who are pursuing at least half-time coursework (a minimum of 4.5 credits hours in the fall, spring, and summer), are eligible to apply for tuition assistance in the form of federal Stafford Loans and Graduate PLUS loans. Graduate students who have been approved to earn certification as a separate credential (without a master’s degree) are also eligible for federal student aid, although limitations apply to their borrowing status. Non-matriculated students should explore alternative financing options with the Office of Financial Aid 610.527.0200, Ext. 2221.  Financial Aid Disbursements and Refund Disbursements The Financial Aid office applies disbursed actual money to the student’s account. If aid is still pending after the date noted, the student should contact the Financial Aid office to see if all required paperwork has been submitted and signed.   The Office of Student Accounts has fourteen (14) calendar days to release any credit refund due the student. By law, federal guidelines state that credits created by financial aid be refunded within fourteen (14) days from the date of financial aid disbursements, to issue any excess funds. In the calculation of the student refund, any pending aid will not be counted until such time that the aid is disbursed by Financial Aid.  Students should view their information on the Rosemont INet to see if all required forms have been submitted and signed. Any questions should be directed to finaid@rosemont.edu or 610-527 0200 ext. 2221.  GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS    A limited number of competitive Graduate Assistantships are available to matriculated graduate students. Awards are recommended by the Program Director, and granted by the Dean of the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies.  The following procedures apply:  1. Award recipients must be fully accepted into a master’s degree program (i.e., candidates who are pursuing certification only, or who are non-matriculated, are not eligible). 2. Awards are based upon promise and/or achievement in the student’s chosen program of study, as well as the expertise and availability to fulfill the work requirements associated with the award. Interviews are required. 3. Graduate Assistants receive one course tuition waiver per semester and fulfill a work requirement of 10 hours per week during each semester of the award. Work assignments are based upon program needs and are assigned and are usually supervised by the Program Director or other academic administrators. Award recipients are required to maintain and submit a weekly log, detailing the work 67  and the time they spend on each assignment. 4. Award recipients are reviewed annually by their Program Director. Awards may be renewed, for a maximum of two years, dependent upon satisfactory work performance and demonstrated scholarship within the program. 5. Candidates must complete an Application for Graduate Assistantships online. The deadline for fall applications is July 1st; should positions remain open, the deadline for spring applications is December 1st.   DISBURSING MONEY TO THE STUDENT   Undergraduate accelerated students Loan funds will be disbursed, by Financial Aid, to the Office of Student Accounts the first week of the second session for each semester.   Graduate students Loan funds will be disbursed, by Financial Aid, to the Office of Student Accounts beginning with the day after the end of the drop/add period of each semester.   MBA & Education students need to register for both sessions in the semester before the beginning of each semester.  The graduate financial aid application must be completed before any financial aid can be awarded. This form is located on the Rosemont INet.  Verification of Enrollment with the National Student Loan Clearinghouse The College is required to report student enrollment at least three times per semester to the National Student Loan Clearinghouse (NSLDS). The NSLDS serves as an agent to inform loan guarantors that the student is officially registered on at least a half time basis. Students who are applying for loans must be registered for a minimum of six credits per semester. Students who fall below half time status may jeopardize the status of their loan.  Veteran’s Affairs Benefits Students who are eligible to receive educational benefits from the United States Department of Veteran’s Affairs must contact the Office of the Registrar.  The Office of the Registrar certifies the enrollment of all eligible veterans, dependents who are eligible to review benefits, and members of the Reserves and National Guard who choose to use their veteran's education benefits. The Department of Veteran's Affairs determines the eligibility of each veteran. Benefits are dependent on the student's enrollment status at Rosemont College.  If you are a new student at Rosemont College and would like to apply for veteran's education benefits, please contact Keely Cutts, Associate Registrar at (215) 527 0200, Ext. 2307, or keely.cutts@rosemont.edu.

ACADEMIC SCHEDULES  COURSE SESSIONS AND SEMESTERS   Courses in the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies are offered in a traditional classroom setting, online or a blend of both formats.  Undergraduate Professional Studies courses are offered in nine, five-week accelerated sessions, running continuously throughout the year.  Graduate Studies course offerings vary by program. Some programs are taught using the traditional full-length (13 week) semester and others are accelerated and are offered in two, seven-week sessions per semester (six seven-week sessions per year).  Due to the accelerated format, attendance at all classes and substantial online and textbook preparation is critical. The full academic content and quality are provided and expected during these fast-moving programs. Classes typically run weeknights from 6:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.  68  The academic calendar for the current year (September through August) is posted within this catalog under the Academic Information section and on the registrar’s office webpage. If a class falls on a holiday it will be listed under the “Breaks” column.  Your instructor will communicate to you how the student is expected to make up any missed class time over breaks.  Occasionally, elective Turbo classes are held over a single weekend, from Friday through Sunday, but all required courses and electives are offered on weekday evenings except Fridays.  SEMESTER HOURS     Baccalaureate level degrees in Professional Studies require 120 credits to complete the degree, Graduate level programs vary in length and students should consult with their advisor and discuss the specific program requirements in the Academic Programs section to ascertain the semester hours required in a particular degree program. CAPSTONE EXPERIENCE    All master’s programs require a culminating experience.  Depending on the degree, this could be a Thesis, Applied Business Report, student teaching, Administrative Internship or a Counseling Internship.  Students should consult their specific program requirements in the Academic Programs  COMMENCEMENT CRITERIA FOR THE MAY, SEPTEMBER OR JANUARY DIPLOMA     All Rosemont students who are candidates for degree completion and diplomas must meet the following general criteria:  Complete all degree requirements with an acceptable minimum GPA (2.00 for Professional Studies, 3.00 for Graduate Studies);  Obtain academic and financial clearances from appropriate administrative offices of the College;  Submit an Application for Diploma to the Office of the Registrar by the published deadline.

International students completing twelve credits (4 courses) in Sessions 51, 52 and 53 in the fall and twelve credits (4 courses) in sessions 51, 52 and 53 in the spring consecutively are not required to register for summer sessions.  Exceptions to this policy for a reduced course load must be approved by the Designated School Official prior to registration for a semester.  72  STUDENT ADVISING AND REGISTRATION PROCEDURES      All matriculated and non-matriculated students must contact their Program Director prior to registering for classes in order to create an Individual Plan of Study. The Program Director, Student Services, and the student will use this plan as the guide for successful completion of the degree. If for any reason a student needs to diverge from the plan, the student must contact their Program Director to discuss the best alternatives that will assure timely and successful completion of the degree and course-taking that is aligned with the student’s goals.  Students will register for all courses through the Rosemont portal, “iWay”.  The iWay is the self-service portal students use to register and access final grades.    Students encountering technical difficulties, including logging in or with their password, must contact Information Services. New and existing students who have not registered for 12 months are required to reapply and update their enrollment information.  DROP/ADD POLICY     At the beginning of each semester/session, a designated Drop/Add period allows students to adjust their schedules.  There is no grade penalty, and a full refund is issued for classes dropped within the first week of the starting session/semester.  Students can drop a course via the iWay. Students who encounter difficulties adding or dropping classes should contact the Registrar’s Office or their advisor. After the drop/add period ends, a student must formally withdraw from a course following procedures outlined in the Withdrawal Policy.  For a list of drop/add dates for the current calendar year please refer to the ACADEMIC CALENDAR section of this catalog.  WITHDRAWAL POLICY     Students may withdraw from a course up to the withdrawn deadline through submission of a withdrawal form (dates for each session are published on the Academic Calendar). After the withdraw deadline has passed, student will receive the grade they earn for the course.   Withdrawal deadlines are:  End of the 3rd week for 5 week classes  End of the 4th week for 7 week classes  End of the 7th week for 13 week classes  Tuition is not refunded for withdrawals. A grade of “W” will appear on the student’s official transcript, indicating a withdrawal from the course, which carries no penalty in the calculation of the student’s GPA. A student must notify the instructor and Program Director prior to transmitting the withdrawal form to Student Services. The Course Withdrawal Form can be obtained on the iWay on the Student Services page under the section “Handouts” or from the Office of Student Services.  MILITARY DEPLOYMENT POLICY   Rosemont College recognizes the challenges military personnel and their families face during times of uncertainty.  The College acknowledges that military students on deployment or permanent duty stations may experience difficulties with completing their degree requirements and/or distance learning courses.  Rosemont encourages service members to continue with their education and will remain flexible and responsive to their needs.  In support of deployed forces, the College will provide the following options:  Student Services, upon receipt of deployment orders, will drop a student from class(es) under “justifiable circumstances”.  No charges will be assessed to the student for the dropped class(es) nor will the course(s) in question appear on the student’s official transcript.  In cases where deployment orders are not presented to the Office of Student Services the student must follow the College’s standard withdrawal procedure.  A retroactive appeal to have the courses and charges removed from the student’s record can be initiated upon delivery of the required deployment orders.  Students remaining in a class after the drop/add period, and desiring to complete the course have the option of petitioning their instructor for an incomplete (I) grade.  If granted, students must complete all unfinished coursework by the end of the semester following deployment.  If the course is not completed in the time allotted and the student has submitted a copy of his/her deployment orders the course and tuition will be removed from the student’s 73  record.  If the student does not complete the coursework in the allotted time and did not submit a copy of their deployment orders the incomplete grade (I) will convert to an “F” or failing grade for the course.  Procedure: Students should notify the Director of Student Services and submit a copy of the deployment orders.  Without proper documentation, the student must follow the normal College withdrawal and refunding procedures.  Active military students should work directly with the Director of Student Services.    ENROLLMENT VERIFICATION    The Office of the Registrar verifies enrollment and student status (full-time/part-time). A student’s status is automatically reported to the National Student Clearinghouse. Various forms from health insurers, employers, lending agencies, and other entities may be sent to the Registrar via mail or fax. Students may also submit a form or verification request to the Office of the Registrar in person.  Please contact the Office of the Registrar at (610) 527 0200, Ext. 2305. The Office of the Registrar can also issue a letter of enrollment verification upon request. Your request will be processed within 2-3 business days. Insufficient or inaccurate information may prevent the College from issuing your verification.  ATTENDANCE POLICY     Regular class attendance is essential to successful academic achievement.    Absences are permitted only in cases of illness or other legitimate causes (family emergency, death in the family, etc.).  Students are required to present documentation for an absence on a timely basis.  In cases of an excused absence from a class, the student has both the opportunity and responsibility to make up all missed class work.  Faculty members have the discretion to accept work from or schedule make-up exams or quizzes for students who miss a class without a legitimate excuse.  Absences are counted from the first day of class.  Late registrants will have absences accrued when they first meet a class.  NOTE -- Students with a hold from the Business Office are expected to attend the class in which they expect to enroll from the first day of the semester. I fhte hold is not cleared by the end of the drop/add period students will not be permitted to remain in the class.  Excessive absences will affect students’ grades in courses.  The grade penalty for a course is defined on the syllabus and is determined by the faculty member teaching the course.  The U.S. Department of Education requires that all faculty must maintain detailed attendance records showing the student’s last date of attendance in a course.  If a student stops attending a class and does not withdrawal from the course during the prescribed time period a WN grade will be given.  The WN grade is an administrative grade and will reflect the last date of the student’s recorded attendance.  Issuance of this grade may have financial implications for the student and impact financial aid.  Faculty have the option of submitting an “FX” grade to students who failed the course due to excessive absences.  The FX grade is calculated as an “F” in the student’s grade point average.  For students receiving financial aid, failure from non-attendance may require the student to refund to the College all or part of his/her financial aid.  Faculty are required to provide the date when the student last attended.  If a class absence is necessary because of an activity being held in another course, the faculty member teaching that course will notify the Program Director and Academic Dean in advance of the activity.  Students are not allowed more than one absence per semester due to a conflict with an activity sponsored by another course or a college organization. This absence is in addition to those allowed above.  If faculty members can document that a student scheduled to attend an event or a field trip has missed too many classes, or if they are giving an exam or quiz that day, the student should attend class and not the outside activity.  In that case, the faculty member teaching the course will notify the Academic Dean or the Dean of Students that the absence request has been denied.    If a student must be absent due to serious injury or illness, or Family Medical Leave of Absence (FMLA), for more than two weeks, they are strongly encouraged to take a leave of absence for 74  the semester during which the incident has/will occur(ed).  Students should follow the Leave of Absence policy and provide the needed documentation.  Students are also encouraged to meet with the Financial Aid Office as extended absences and leaves can affect aid.  Online Attendance Students are expected to contribute actively to online courses by contributing to interactive discourse multiple times per week and every week throughout the duration of the course.  Students who fail to contribute actively and substantively in any five-day period during the course will be considered to have been “absent” for 20 % of the course for undergraduate professional studies students and 15% of the course for graduate students.  Such absence will be treated in the same way as a missed class of face-to-face instruction, and will be subject to one letter grade reduction in the final grade.  Students can be required to do make-up work.  Students who fail to contribute actively and substantively in any subsequent five-day period of time are advised to withdraw or receive a failing grade.  GRADE REPORTS     Final grades are posted in the Rosemont iWay. The student's standing for that semester or session is shown by the grade point average. Letter grades are given for individual courses and grade points are used to compute averages for each student at the end of each semester on a cumulative basis. These averages are determined by multiplying the grade points for each course by the credits for the course and dividing the sum of these products by the sum of the credits the student represent.    Undergraduate Professional Studies students are required to maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 for continued study and for degree completion.  Graduate students are required to maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 for continued study and for degree completion.  The faculty will grade student work as follows: Grade Quality Points   A 4.00 Superior Quality   A- 3.67 B+ 3.33 B 3.00 Good Quality B- 2.67 C+ 2.33 Marginal Quality C 2.00  C- 1.67 D+ 1.33 D 1.00 D- 0.67 F 0.00 Failure FX 0.00 Failure due to excessive absence  The following are not calculated into the average I 0.00 Incomplete – if not resolved,    becomes Failure W 0.00 Withdrawal – no credit, no    penalty WN 0.00 Withdrawal Never Attended –    student  PA 0.00 Pass – for Pass/Fail courses only WIP 0.00 Work in Progress     INCOMPLETE (I)     An incomplete may be given only in exceptional circumstances and at the instructor’s discretion. The student must initiate the request. The instructor, after consulting with the Program Director, decides whether or not to grant the request.  An Incomplete grade not removed by the subsequent January 15 for a summer course, by the subsequent May 15 for a fall course, or by the subsequent September 15 for a spring course will become an “F” grade.  REPEATING A COURSE      For Professional Studies students, if a “D” or “F” is received in a required course, the course must be repeated. A GPA of at least 2.0 for undergraduate students and 3.0 for graduate students is required for graduation.  For Graduate students if a grade of “C” or lower is received in a required course then, the course must be repeated.  A GPA of at least 3.0 is required for graduation.  A student who has received a lower than required grade in a required course may repeat the course for a better grade. When a required course is repeated, the following rules shall apply:  1. The repeated course must be equivalent to the previous course.  2. The second time the course is taken it cannot be taken for Pass/Fail credit.  3. Both course and grade will be recorded in the student’s file and on the transcript.  4. For calculation of the Grade Point Average (GPA) and for fulfillment of curriculum 75  requirements, the credit and the grade of the repeated course will apply and the credit and the grade of the original course will no longer count. The repeated course will be identified on the transcript with an “R” or the repeated course.  GRADE APPEALS      Students who wish to appeal a final course grade must first talk directly with the faculty member involved to seek a mutually acceptable resolution.   Undergraduate Professional Studies students may only appeal a final course grade below a “D+” (1.33); all appeals must be initiated within two weeks of the student’s receipt of his/her final course grades.  Graduate Students may only appeal a final course grade below a “B” (3.0); all appeals must be initiated within two weeks of the student’s receipt of his/her final course grades.  If the matter cannot be resolved between the student and the faculty member, the student has two weeks to appeal the matter, in writing, to the director of the program in which the student is enrolled.  The student must document the objection in writing and furnish any supporting documentary evidence to his/her Program Director.  The Director will request written information from the instructor, and will try to resolve the matter within two weeks of receipt of the appeal.  If the matter cannot be resolved by the Director, the student has until no later than 10 weeks after receipt of the disputed grade to request an appeal to the Academic Standards and Practice Committee. The student will ask the Program Director in writing to forward all of the documents to the Academic Standards and Practices Committee for adjudication. The Director will include all materials from the student and from the instructor, as well as a brief description of his or her efforts to resolve the matter. The Committee will review all documentation forwarded by the Director and notify the student in writing of its decision. A copy of both the student’s appeal and the Committee’s decision will be placed in the student’s file. The Committee will act in as timely a manner as possible, and within no more than 15 weeks at most beyond the date of the student’s initial receipt of the disputed grade. The decision of the Committee is final.  STUDENT ACADEMIC CONCERNS   Students who have any course-related concerns (other than grade appeals) must first work with the faculty member involved, prior to their next class meeting, seeking assistance and/or a mutually acceptable resolution. If the matter cannot be resolved between the student and the faculty member, the student has two weeks to bring the matter, in writing, to the director of the program in which the student is enrolled.  The Program Director has full discretion to discuss the matter with the student and/or the faculty member; the Program Director may also collect any relevant documentation (syllabus, course assignments, etc.).  The Program Director will make every reasonable effort to mediate a resolution, and will document the outcome in writing, placing a copy in the student’s academic file.  STEPPING OUT AND LEAVE OF ABSENCE   Rosemont College recognizes that adult students encounter professional and personal reasons for suspending their education.  Students may notify their Director and/or SGPS Student Services when they expect to step out for a session(s). Students who are eligible to register but have not done so are normally contacted by their Program Director and/or Student Services to help them become re-engaged in their program at the earliest opportunity.   A leave of absence is required for students requesting more than a one-year absence. A leave of absence beyond one year may be granted in extraordinary circumstances with permission of the Program Director and the Dean of the Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies. Students needing extended leave should request a leave of absence by contacting their Program Director and the Director of Student Services.   A student who was not granted a leave of absence and has not enrolled in courses for a period of one year will be dismissed from the program. In that case, the student must apply for readmission. All requirements for the degree must be completed within six years of the first admission. A student may request an extension after meeting with the Program Director and developing a degree completion plan.  76  Medical Leave of Absence A student may, on the recommendation of a physician, request a medical leave of absence for reasons of health at any time. Prior to a student returning, the student must submit documentation from their doctor that the medical condition no longer prohibits the student from returning to classes.   The Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies reserve the right to request that a student take a leave of absence for reasons related to the student’s health or well-being.  ACADEMIC PROBATION  UNDERGRADUATE PROFESSIONAL STUDIES STUDENTS      Any matriculated student who does not achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. The student will receive a letter from the Dean specifying the requirements to be fulfilled for the student to maintain academic standards. The student will have the next two consecutive sessions during which they enroll to obtain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or better. During this probationary period, a student will normally be permitted to take no more than one course per session. Additionally, tutoring, or other measures to improve academic skills, may be required of the student in order to continue in the School of Professional Studies program. Students will also be required to attend all class sessions. After two courses, should a student’s GPA not reach a 2.0, the student will be dismissed from Rosemont College. Students who are successfully removed from academic probation, but whose GPA again drops below a 2.0, may be dismissed from Rosemont College.  Students must receive a grade of “C” (2.0) or better in each course in their major program. If a student receives a lower grade in a course, the student must retake the course. Credits for courses with a grade of “C-“or lower will not count towards fulfillment of the student’s degree. The initial grade will be included in the computation of the cumulative GPA.  GRADUATE STUDENTS     Any matriculated student who does not achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.0, or who earns more than one final course grade below a B-, will be placed on academic probation.  The student will receive a letter from the Dean specifying the requirements to be fulfilled for the student to regain academic standing. The student must achieve a minimum overall GPA of 3.0 within nine additional credits of graduate work and must earn final grades of B or better for all remaining courses throughout the duration of his/her program of study.  Any student who does not meet these grading criteria will be dismissed from the program.  DISMISSAL       The Rosemont College Schools of Graduate and Professional Studies reserve the right to dismiss at any time any student whose academic standing is unsatisfactory, whose conduct is in violation of College policies or procedures, or whose continuance would be detrimental to the student’s own health or to the health and well-being of other members of the College community. In such cases tuition and fees may not be refunded and will be canceled.

Our many courses investigate painting, sculpture, architecture, the decorative arts, photography, and film in broad chronological and geographical exposure.  Our many interdisciplinary courses explore areas of overlap between art, its making, women’s issues, politics, language, criticism, and philosophy.    History of Art majors explore the History of Art Criticism, in helping to define why we think what we think and why we write what we write about the changing History of Art, based on its founding mothers and fathers.      History of Art majors are encouraged to travel abroad and experience the art of the world, first-hand.  Internships help students secure on-site experience and job training at museums, galleries, advertising firms, and at many other venues.     All History of Art courses include integrated, interactive museum, gallery, or other service-learning components.  These may be visits to and work in area museums and exhibiting galleries; organized travel-study options; symposia and panel discussions with educators, museum personnel, artists, conservationists, and art critics--depending on the focus and nature of the course.  Students may establish a major or minor course of study in the History of Art.  Interested students are also invited to devise interdisciplinary majors linking the History of Art to other subject matters, such as foreign language, studio art, philosophy, gender studies, or other disciplines.   Planning these curricula is done with the major advisor.   PROGRAM GOALS    GOAL 1:  History of Art majors will be able to recognize and classify canonical works of art in major media --painting, sculpture, architecture, and minor arts--in terms of name of work, artist, chronology, and culture and to apply their knowledge to today’s visual culture.  Objective 1-1:  History of art majors will learn to recognize and classify canonical works of art in terms of name of work, artist, chronology, style, and culture in their course lectures and work, in their reading assignments, and in their in-class presentations.   Outcome 1:     On senior comprehensive examinations, students will be able to recognize and classify canonical works of art in 80% of the examples given.   Outcome 2:  In “History of Art, I” and “History of Art, II”, students will study the western canon of art –painting, sculpture, architecture, and minor arts—and learn to visually recognize and classify these works according to a formalist method.  They will typically write short responses to key art works and well as be tested.  Students will also have exposure to actual works of art in their museum or monument setting, by, for example, visiting local museums for 14 hrs. per semester, as per the one additional credit Enrichment.  Positive on-site experiences with actual works of art will sustain visitation, influence lifelong museum-visiting habits, and embrace long-term learning, by offering cognitive learning beyond facts and concepts to include process skills and personal involvement.  Students will also have exposure to actual works of art in their museum or monument setting, by, for example, visiting local museums for 14 hrs. per semester, as per the one additional credit Enrichment.  Positive on-site experiences with actual works of art will sustain visitation, influence lifelong museum-visiting habits, and embrace long-term learning, by offering cognitive learning beyond facts and concepts to include process skills and personal involvement.  Objective 1-2:  History of art majors will recognize when historical and canonical works of art are used in popular visual culture such as advertising, signage, film, television, printed ephemera.      Outcome 1:  In “History of Art, II,” exposure to contemporary visual culture, within the context of recognition of classical works of art, will help students understand and analyze both, enabling them to navigate the modern art world around them  Outcome 2:  In courses which involve the understanding and manipulation of canonical and historical works of art within contemporary visual culture such as any Modern Art course, students will learn to excavate past visual cultures and the traces of them in today’s art world.  GOAL 2:  History of Art majors will be able to formally analyze works of art --painting, sculpture, architecture, minor arts--with regard to their formal elements and media and to understand and apply other critical methods necessary for effective methodological research with works of art.  Objective 2.1:   History of Art majors will be taught to formally master techniques to analyze works of art--painting, sculpture, architecture, minor arts--with regard to material, color size, composition, design, color, line, materials, and other formal elements—in class lectures and discussions, with reading assignments, and in small weekly written assignments.  Outcome 1:  History of Art majors will develop skills to deconstruct works of art in all areas and stylistic periods, based on their shared/comparative formal qualities. Objective 2.2:   History of Art majors will be able to apply other critical methods necessary for effective research within works of art.  Outcome 1:   In “History of Art Criticism,” students will demonstrate their understanding of various critical methods as applied to art’s history. 87  Outcome 2:  In “Art Historical Methodologies,” students will take a comprehensive final examination carefully evaluating issues in the history of western writing on art.             Outcome 3:  In the course, “Art Historical Methodologies,” students will evidence their ability to research art historical materials, and to write coherent senior theses papers on pre-approved topics, developed within the course. Students’ writing will be vetted by three blind professional art historians/readers; students will demonstrate their ability to research and analyze appropriate art historical sources.  GOAL 3:  Students will learn the critical skills necessary for effective research within the discipline of the History of Art.  Objective 3-1:  Students will be able to apply the critical skills necessary for effective research within the discipline of the History of Art.  GOAL 4:  Learning for the History of Art majors will become an experiential bridge that draws together distant peoples, diverse ideas, and diverse cultures in social, artistic, and cultural dialogues, according to the Cornelian mission of the College.  To promote dialogue and mutual understanding, they will view the world as a classroom through exposure to the richness of the past and the innumerable possibilities of the future.  History of Art majors will be able to apply their knowledge of the History of Art to broaden their understanding and appreciation of other cultures, religions, and rituals.  Objective 4.1:  History of art majors will be required to enlist in study abroad experiences and/or Internship experience in consultation with the major advisor and in tandem with the Coordinator of Experiential Learning.  Students may choose from among the many travel/study programs sponsored by Rosemont College or in other pre-approved, vetted study abroad programs offered by other colleges or universities.  History of Art majors will gain intensive, hands-on, first-hand exposure to foreign cultures  as well as deep self-understanding through the experience of other countries’ histories, social customs, and works of art.  They will also acquire some fluency in a language and/or literature as well as an understanding of a country’s visual culture, history, social customs, and everyday life and rituals.  Through internships and/or travel/study, students will learn to appreciate works of art first-hand and work with the primary objects of their discipline as well as gain on-site employment experience. High personal involvement with a culture, on-site, will increase motivation and interest, spark curiosity, improve attitudes toward art, and embrace long-term learning.  Outcome 1:  In Study Abroad experiences, students will adequately report on and describe their cultural experiences by keeping journals, report on film and other pertinent assignments, and prepare analytical photo-essays on pre-approved works of art.(etc.), in order to reflect on their experiences.  Outcome 2:  In Internship experiences, students will keep diaries, work logs, and receive positive letters of evaluation from their on-site supervisors, in order to reflect on their experiences.

It consists of:  a senior paper, a slide examination, and an essay examination.  The senior is expected to enroll in “Art Historical Methods and Research” which is a course designed, in-part, to engage the senior in preparation for the testing and writing portions of the comprehensive examination.  Each student is expected to confer with the History of Art advisor at the end of junior year to discuss the senior paper topic in order that the student begin thinking about and collecting information and bibliography during the summer months between junior and senior year.  (Timetables and descriptions of examination are distributed during the “Art Historical Methods and Research” course.)  Rationale The student is tested in these various modes in order to insure that upon completion of the History of Art degree at Rosemont College, the student will have:  developed critical thinking and good methodology as well as a polished and sophisticated research and writing style in the art historical tradition (the senior paper); a firm knowledge of the chronology and scope of the history of western art (the slide examination); and a firm grasp on the synthetic and critical literature within the History of Art and the ability to discuss thematically and diachronically, issues of importance to the history of western visual culture (the essayexamination).     Elective Credits The remaining credit hours are electives and are to be chosen from the History of Art courses.  Elective credits make up any remaining credit hours such that students graduate with 120 credits.

History majors acquire a variety of research and reporting skills that are useful for careers including teaching, law, social service, government, journalism, business, and museumship.   History students are also trained to assess, analyze, and apply information from various sources and to communicate these findings effectively to others in written and oral reports.  Our students gain expertise in locating accurate and relevant information, in evaluating the value of written and audio/visual resources, and in recognizing the presuppositions and biases in the sources that the student uncover.  Students are encouraged to hone these skills through service learning, internships in cultural institutions, work in archives and historical societies, and also through research conducted in conjunction with faculty.  PROGRAM GOALS     GOAL 1: Students will be able to analyze primary historical sources and use the information to answer complex historical questions.   Objective 1:  Students will be able to analyze a historical document and accurately explain its apparent purpose, target audience, and biases in order to reach conclusions about its validity as a source of historical evidence.  Objective 2:  Students will be able to apply the knowledge they take from primary sources and apply them in attempts to answering historical questions and issues.  GOAL 2: Students will be both skilled at research in secondary sources and able to present their findings to others effectively.  Objective 1:  Students will be able to learn how to formulate valid research questions, determine what information is needed to answer those questions, gather information, assess its value, and then apply the information ethically and legally.  Objective 2:  Students will be able to present the results of their research effectively in both written and oral forms.  GOAL 3: Students will be able to apply a historical perspective to contemporary problems to reach conclusions about continuity or change.

Upon completion of the program, students are prepared to enter such fields as business, technology, and science.  Students can seek employment in the private or government sectors or continue their studies at the graduate level.    The Mathematics minor is designed to enable a student at Rosemont College to pursue his/her interest in Mathematics while obtaining a degree in another field.  The primary motivational factor for students to pursue a minor in Mathematics is the desire to develop an understanding of the practical application of Mathematics to other disciplines.  Rosemont College is committed to the educational mission of preparing students for future employment in the many areas involving Mathematics.  Rosemont offers the opportunity for underprepared students to prepare themselves for their STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) courses through the study of College Algebra and Trigonometry prior to embarking on the more demanding courses required for the BA in Mathematics. The program strives to inculcate a true passion and understanding that Mathematics is the real world at every turn.  Our Mathematics faculty is dedicated in their practice of current Mathematical pedagogy and works in conjunction with the Education faculty to best prepare students for their chosen profession.  Our over-arching goals are to nurture our students’ development of problem solving skills, critical thinking skills, qualitative literacy, and the ability to effectively communicate Mathematical reasoning.    Students in the Mathematics major who wish to teach at the high school or middle school level may also choose to obtain a Grades 7-12 teaching certification.  Students who successfully complete the Mathematics certification program are eligible for teaching certification upon graduation.  Please refer to the Education Department section of the catalog for details.  Rosemont College recognizes the importance of having a strong foundation in Mathematics for non-majors.  The program in Mathematics in the Undergraduate College provides solid grounding in the areas of algebra, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics.  Rosemont’s Mathematics courses emphasize both the understanding of the mathematical concepts and applications.  The Mathematics department is dedicated to science, business, and the social sciences.

Among the theories covered are conservatism and neo-conservatism, classical liberalism, libertarianism, socialism, and other current political theories.  PHI  0245 - JOURNEY TO THE EAST:  SELF, KNOWLEDGE, AND REALITY IN ASIAN THOUGHT Credits:  3 Although Asian philosophy shares many of the same concerns which have occupied philosophers in the Western tradition for over two millennia, there is an emphasis in much of Indian, Chinese, and Japanese thought on the process of self-cultivation, the goal of which is to attain direct insight into the nature of reality. And yet, despite this common feature, the methods practiced with a view to achieving this goal are grounded in philosophical frameworks unique to each tradition. This course will explore the traditions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, with a view to examining not just the various understandings of self-cultivation and its transformative effect on the individual, but also to examine the greater philosophical contexts within which the practical concerns for self-realization are situated. In so doing we will explore a variety of views on the nature of reality, knowledge, ethics, and social life.  Prerequisite:  "

ENG  0160 - COLLEGE WRITING I:  COMPOSITION AND CRITICAL THOUGHT Credits:  3 The first of the course’s three principle assumptions is Rosemont College’s School of Graduate and Professional Studies (SGPS) undergraduate programs are “reading and writing” intensive; students’ opportunities for academic success are directly related to skills such as comprehension, interpretation, analysis and oral and written communication.   The college’s tradition and philosophical underpinnings of “meeting the needs of the age” inspire the second assumption: Rosemont’s SGPS programs target both the traditional student and the adult learner, i.e., individuals who are working, possibly raising a family, and may have been out of formal academic settings for years. The SGPS provides courses for learners who may not have the opportunity to continue or complete education within traditional educational settings. This open-ended acceptance of students from all walks of life, across all age cohorts, and across a diversity of living and educational experiences calls for all learners to begin their academic endeavors with a course that introduces concepts, clarifies expectations, and provides guidance for success.   The third assumption is based on the “learning curve.” Because acceptance into the SGPS is not predicated on standardized test scores, students of all levels of experience and expertise enter the program equally. However, not every student is prepared for the demand and expectations that govern accelerated degree requirements. This particular course intends to identify those different levels of writing competence and guide students toward appropriate intervention when needed. This introductory course will help allay anxiety, assess needs, and direct learners toward a path of academic success. This course is designed to assist all learners to reflect, assess, and plan the path best suited for their personal development.

HLS  4133 - THE PSYCHOLOGY OF TERRORISM Credits:  3 This course serves as an introduction for homeland security professionals to terrorism as a psychological phenomenon. Government agencies involved in homeland security need to understand the psychological consequences of mass-casualty terrorist attacks and other disasters.

Current government strategies used to disseminate information to terrorist groups; psychological phenomena related to media coverage of terrorism; misconceptions and inaccuracies about the socio-political and religious motivations of terrorist groups; “profiling” and the typical psychological and cultural makeup of modern terrorists; and the social and cultural psychology of public conceptions of terrorists and acts of terror will be examined.

While the insights of some short story theoreticians will be given consideration, the stories and the vision, sensibilities and craft of the authors will be our chief objects of analysis.  The course is designed both for those who want to teach the short story at the university level and for writers of short fiction who desire to learn from the masters of the genre.   LIT  7007 - POET LAUREATES Credits:  3 This class is designed as a seminar using a constructivist learning approach, that is, students will engage in collaborative learning and will, in a participatory seminar setting, construct their understanding of the issue of voice in poetry, and, through study of many of America’s poets laureate, will examine the concept of an “American Voice.”  We will read and discuss the work of a variety of twentieth and twenty-first century American poets laureate in order to consider whether such a thing as an “American poetic voice” exists, and whether there is, has been, or should be, a “representative American voice.”  We will also consider the impact individual poets have had on the contemporary American poetic cannon.  LIT  7009 - LITERATURE IN THE 21ST CENTURY Credits:  3 This course examines the literature happening "now" and the critical thought at work in both creating and analyzing it. This course takes on contemporary issues, especially those relevant to the reasons for reading and writing in the twenty-first century, by looking at a wide range of work currently being published, from modernist to postmodern and post-post modern aesthetics and sensibilities. The course will also examine issues within contemporary literature--such as race, ethnicity, and gender; transgressive cultures; war and terrorism; and globalization-- along with the appearance of new literary forms (e.g., electronic literatures and new media) and their impact on the evolution of current literature.  LIT  7010 - SEMINAR: BRITISH LIT. IN VICTORIAN AGE Credits:  3 An intense study of the major novels, poetry, and prose stylists of the Victorian era. The course will consider authors such as Browning, Tennyson, Carlyle, Newman, Arnold, Dickens, Eliot, and Thackeray.  LIT  7011 - BRIT. LIT. IN THE AGE/ROMANTICISM Credits:  3 The literary movement we call Romanticism is based on a definition critics came up with well after the fact.  Historically, the term has only applied to a small group of loosely connected yet vastly influential poets and, sometimes, their sisters and wives.  Yet the turn of the nineteenth century in Britain was a turbulent time when the events of the French Revolution were terrorizing the public, when both male and female authors were experimenting with poetic, prose, and dramatic forms, and when even the political entity called "Britain" was not fully unified.  This course will examine the development of the six major Romantic poets (Wordsworth, Coleridge, Blake, Shelley, Byron, and Keats) as well as writers whose work resists the Romantic mode (Jane Austen, Maria Edgeworth) and authors who for many years have fallen off the literary radar altogether (Felicia Hemans, L.E.L., Joanna Baillie, Matthew Lewis).  LIT  7015 - SEMINAR IN 18TH CEN POETRY & PROSE Credits:  3 A study of the social, historical, and aesthetic concerns of the eighteenth century. Representative genres provide an understanding of the shifting focus of this period from satire to sensibility.  LIT  7020 - THE BIOGRAPHER'S ART Credits:  3 A course which focuses on combining the study of examples of biography, ancient and modern, from The Book of Ruth and Plutarch’s Lives through Boswell’s Life of Samuel Johnson, to such recent experimental works as Richard Holme’s Footsteps, with practice in biographical research and writing. Requirements include several short papers and the development of an article-length biographical study that is to be submitted for possible publication to one or more journals.  LIT  7030 - THE MODERN NOVEL Credits:  3 An exploration in depth of the literary condition called Modernism through an investigation of the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Anita Loos, Gertrude Stein, Nella Larson, E.M. Forster, Rose Macaulay, Virginia Woolf, and D.H. Lawrence.  LIT  7031 - SEMINAR: CLASSICAL READINGS Credits:  3 A study of ancient Greek and Latin writers in the genres of epic, lyric poetry, and prose. The selection includes Home (Iliad), Pindar (the odes), Thucydides (History of the Peloponnesian War), Vergil (Aeneid). Horace (odes and epodes), and Cicero (political speeches), in translation. The purpose of this course is to ground the student in the material that was the common repertory for western authors.  LIT  7032 - TOLKIEN Credits:  3 This course examines the major works of J.R.R. Tolkien (The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings) as both the modern continuation of the mythic cycle and the genesis of the contemporary fantasy genre.  Students will study Tolkien's attempt to create a deliberate "mythology" for Britain in the context of his medieval and classical influences, as well as how his works have not only founded the basis of modern fantasy writing but also continue to influence the creation and publication of works in this genre.  Finally, Peter Jackson's film adaptations of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings will be examined as a entrée into the ongoing debate as to whether the film version of a text will ultimately become the "official" version due to its potential for more widespread cultural context.  LIT  7034 - CONFESSIONAL POETRY Credits:  3 Robert Lowell’s landmark volume, Life Studies (1959) forever changed the content of American poetry. What can be seen as “too much information” in the hands of lesser writers, becomes profoundly moving in masters such as Lowell, Anne Sexton, Sylvia Plath and their literary offspring in the 21st century--writers such as Gregory Orr and Sandra Kohler. To round out our knowledge of their lives and the background for their art, we will also read biographies and autobiographical/memoir texts by the major authors in the course.  LIT  7035 - MASTERPIECES IN EUROPEAN DRAMA Credits:  3 From ancient Greece to contemporary Ireland, drama is rooted in the age during which it is born. Through the action and the characters of a drama, the playwright shares his or her view of the nature of life and suggests an age's assessment of what it 236  means to be human. This course will focus on a selection of the great European playwrights, such as Wilde, Shaw, Euripedes, Marlowe, Moliere, Ibsen, Chekhov, Brecht, and Friel.  LIT  7041 - INTRODUCTION TO CRITICAL THEORY:  EXPLORING MEANING Credits:  3 This course will introduce students to the discipline of critical thought and its use in the study of literature and art, particularly the concept of how meaning is shaped and interpreted by both the individual and society at large.  LIT  7042 - RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION Credits:  3 Composition pedagogies—process, expressive, rhetorical, collaborative, cultural studies, critical, feminist, community-service, writing across the curriculum, writing center, and basic writing—and the compositional and rhetorical practices associated with them make up the content of this course. As writers, readers, teachers, and scholars, students develop the skills and experience to teach, develop, and assess critical reading, writing, and research skills in the composition classroom.  LIT  7045 - SELF-PORTRAITS IN LITERATURE Credits:  3 How do writers shape their experience and try to define themselves in their art? We will explore these questions by reading memoirs such as Virginia Woolf's Moments of Being, Marjorie Keenan Rawling's Cross Creek, Anne Lamott's Operating Instructions: A Journal of My Sons' First Year, Richard Wertime's Citadel on the Mountain, and Kate Millett's AD, as well as poets such as Yeats, Robert Lowell, and Adrienne Rich. Artists and photographers such as Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Imogen Cunningham and Becky Young will supplement discussions of literature with some attention to self-portraits. Students will keep a journal for the initial weeks of class. They will draw from that journal to transform their experience into a short story, poem, or short memoir.  LIT  7050 - THE IRISH NOVEL Credits:  3 This course will explore the rich literary traditions of Ireland in relation to the novel. Through the works of Irish authors, such as James Joyce, Oscar Wilde, Emma Donoghue, and Roddy Doyle, we will examine the history, culture, politics, and socioeconomic conditions of Ireland.  LIT  7051 - SEMINAR: SHAKESPEARE Credits:  3  LIT  7052 - SHAKESPEARE AND ADAPTION Credits:  3 One of the reasons that Shakespeare has survived to become the literary and cultural force he is today is because of the endless possibilities embodied in his dramatic works.  Shakespeare's plays have fostered a nearly endless trail of adaptations, continuations, reinterpretations, and revisions, reaching as far back as the seventeenth century.  This course will focus both on Shakespeare's original texts and on a corresponding body of adapted works -- written, drawn, and filmed -- by Dryden, Charles and Mary Lamb, Jane Smiley, and Tom Stoppard, among others.  LIT  7056 - CONTEMPORARY PLAYS AND PLAYWRIGHTS Credits:  3 This course will examine the work of some of the most influential and interesting playwrights of the 20th and 21st centuries, and specific themes/issues that connect them.  Particular attention will be paid to how the playwright's success hinges not only on the actual written element of his or her work, but also upon production of the work.  Playwrights may include Wendy Wasserstein, David Mamet, Paula Vogel, Tony Kushner, and Beth Henley.  LIT  7061 - GOTHIC LITERATURE Credits:  3 An examination of Gothic literature, its prevailing tropes, and the far-reaching effects that this genre has had on subsequent literary movements and even modern fiction.  The conflict between the high-reaching artistic achievements of novels, such as Walpole's The Castle of Otranto and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and the popular, money-making works of the Gothic trade will be discussed, with a particular view as to what works should constitute the Gothic canon.  Reading selections may include The Castle of Ortranto, Frankenstein, Radcliffe's The Italian, as well as several Gothic-influenced works and authors, such as Jane Austen's Northanger Abbey, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Edgar Allan Poe, Joyce Carol Oates, and Ann Rice.  LIT  7063 - DRAMATURGY Credits:  3 The first part of this course will be devoted to understanding the historical and cultural background of playwrights and how the societal context influences the creation of the work. The second component involves understanding the work of the dramaturge as an assistant to help the playwright improve the script.  LIT  7065 - PERCEPTIONS OF WITCHCRAFT IN LITERATURE Credits:  3 Using works by writers such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Arthur Miller, as well as fables and fairytales, this course will study the witch as a stock character of literature. It will focus on the perception of this character in fairytales, novels, and plays and then compare these perceptions with the reality of witchcraft through the ages.  LIT  7070 - FILM:  ADAPTATION OF LITERATURE TO FILM Credits:  3 Like the translator, the adaptor who translates a classic work of literature for the screen is engaged in an act of transformation which requires him or her to balance the narration, thematic, and stylistic elements of one moment in a text with those in another and to choose from this nexus of interaction and meaning a solution that is cinematically equivalent to the original situation. The central aim of this course then is to examine the challenging process of translating literature to film and to determine either the richness or the impoverishment of adaptations based on the works of celebrated authors.  LIT  7072 - POPULAR CULTURE AND LITERATURE Credits:  3 This course examines the relationship between pop cultural forms and literature of the 20th-century. We will investigate the ways that film, radio, television, music, comic books, pop art, and advertising have influenced literature since the Second World War, in terms of both form and content. Situating each work within its historical, social, and political contexts, we will examine how specific writers engaged with the pop culture of their day and confronted such issues as civil rights, feminism, class conflict, racial antagonism, intimacy, sexual liberation, war, and terrorism. In addition to works of pop culture, our reading list will draw on novels, poems, plays, memoir, and creative nonfiction. 237  LIT  7075 - SCRIPT ANALYSIS Credits:  3 This course will examine the texts of plays, television scripts, and film scripts using in depth analysis, with an emphasis on the vision and intention of the authors, and how that vision can change during production and the occasionally conflicting vision of the director.  LIT  7080 - MODERN CREATIVE NONFICTION Credits:  3 This course takes a look at modern creative nonfiction memoirs and narrative, beginning with Truman Capote’s In Cold Blood and ending with contemporary works.  Creative Nonfiction entails a variety of texts: personal essays, memoir, travel and food writing, biography, literary journalize, and other hybridized forms. This course not only involves reading contemporary creative nonfiction texts but also scholarly and generalist writings about contemporary creative nonfiction, its characteristics and definitions, the ethics of writing “factual fiction.” and the seeming lack of published literary criticism of nonfiction texts.  There will be the option to respond to the published works with one’s own creative nonfiction.

HLS  3100 - INTRODUCTION TO HOMELAND SECURITY Credits:  3 This course provides an overview of the essential ideas that constitute the emerging discipline of homeland security. The objectives of the course are to expand students’ abilities to think critically, analyze and communicate the central tenents of homeland security from a social justice perspective.

GPP 7206," Developmental Editing 3  Developmental Editing or consent from the Program Director. Limit 10 students.  GPP  7206 - DEVELOPMENTAL EDITING Credits:  3 This course explores the delicate, artful, and yet surprisingly technical art of editing. Skilled editors help their authors shape and organize their work, offering constructive suggestions for improvements. Unlike copyediting that focuses on line edits such as grammatical, spelling, etc., developmental editing involves looking at and analyzing structure, language, meaning/message, and gaps in content.  Students will learn how the developmental editor works closely with the author to achieve the goal – completion of the book without diminishing or altering the authors voice.  GPP  7210 - BECOMING AND SUCCEEDING AS A LITERARY AGENT Credits:  3 The Literary Agent plays a crucial role in the book publishing industry as the liaison between the author and the publishing house. A successful literary agent must have the ability to seek out and recognize good quality and marketable book content, and a judicious editorial eye to help authors craft successful proposals and manuscripts. The agent must also build and maintain a strong network with editors in various publishing categories, and serve as an advocate and sales agent on behalf of their author clients. Agents conduct sales, negotiate contracts, and then mentor the fulfillment of contractual negotiations, including handling financial issues and subsidiary rights. In this changing era of book publishing, authors rely heavily on literary agents to shepherd them through the publishing process.  GPP  7213 - PROMOTING CHILDREN'S BOOKS Credits:  3 This course will introduce students to the role of marketing within the children’s book publishing house. Students will learn the principles of successful marketing strategies – both print and online – as well as the fundamentals of product development, branding, and advertising across multiple channels in trade and school & library markets. Students will study the latest trends in children’s publishing along with successful marketing campaigns.  GPP  7214 - LIBRARY AND SCHOOL PUBLISHING Credits:  3 The Library and school markets have shifted and changed over the years. The current market is not only looking to drive and improve literacy, but to involve the common core standards in virtually all books purchased and used in the classroom and/or libraries. In this class, students will learn how children learn to read, the concepts behind the common core, leveling, Hi/Lo readers, supplemental materials, as well as what content, themes, etc. are deemed both acceptable and necessary by this market.  GPP  7217 - BRANDING AND SOCIAL MEDIA Credits:  3 What is a brand? Is it a product, a logo, a brochure? Can a person be a brand? With the popularity and widespread use of social media, branding has become easier and yet more complicated. In this class, students will focus on using various social media platforms to effectively build a personal brand to better understand the components of branding and how publishers, authors, and others use social media to promote their brand with the aim to develop a larger network and gain media exposure.  GPP  7218 - EXPLORING THE MIDDLE GRADE NOVEL Credits:  3 As young adult fiction tackles more and more edgy and difficult topics and readers become more and more sophisticated, there is a greater need to ensure that appropriate topics are available to the middle grade reader (ages 8-12). In this class, students will explore the range of middle grade fiction, compare it to lower young adult, and discuss the decisions that are necessary to determine in which category titles belong. Students will also look at writing styles, authors, themes, topics, content, etc. to better understand this segment of the children’s industry.  GPP  7219 - GRAPHIC NOVEL LITERATURE Credits:  3 Since the 1960s, comics have always had a special place in the college community, mainly in the form of Stan Lee touring college campuses and talking to fans of Marvel’s superheroes. However, in the last decade, comic book classes--now with the more prestigious name of “graphic novel studies”--are finding more and more places in the academic arena. For both the MFA and MA students, this genre offers several benefits. From a publishing point of view, it is one of the biggest and yet unstable markets in literature. For MFA students, the graphic novel structure offers a new means of craft that can greatly benefit a writer regardless of the medium they prefer. And for the literature student, graphic novels offer an untapped potential for literary criticism where the literary student can quickly become an authoritative voice in the field. This course 232  will cater to all three fields of study--the business, the creative, and the critical as students explore the graphic novel genre.  GPP  7220 - MAGAZINE PUBLISHING Credits:  3 A consideration of the strategies and game plans at work in the mass magazine marketplace today. Drawing on examples from print, electronic, cyberspace, and traditional media, the course will detail the issues, theories, techniques, and financial realities that determine the success or failure of magazines.  GPP  7225 - ROLE OF THE MAGAZINE EDITOR Credits:  3 In this class, students will examine the various types and responsibilities of each of the editorial positions within the magazine industry: contributing, copy, associate, managing, and editor-in-chief. Students will also closely examine how each of these editors work on a daily basis to ensure that each article and story written, printed, and/or uploaded directly speaks to the magazine’s editorial vision. In addition to understanding the role of each of these types of editors, students will look at the role of the editor in ensuring the overall success of the magazine.  GPP  7227 - PUBLISHING LAW Credits:  3 Writers, editors, agents, and publishing professionals face legal issues such as copyrights, contracts, commercial, privacy and libel law as well as First Amendment questions involving freedom of speech/press and censorship. This course is designed not only to inform the students of the basic legal concepts involved but also to become competent to critically examine these matters as they arise and competently resolve them.  GPP  7235 - CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN CHILDREN'S PUBLISHING Credits:  3 In this course, students will survey the broad field of publishing for children and young adults, including both trade and academic publishers. We will investigate issues affecting publishing children's books including reading levels, censorship, race and cultural diversity, marketing, and how publishers are (or are not) dealing with digital pressures. Students should be prepared to read a large number of books over the course of the semester.   GPP  7237 - YA GENRE STUDY Credits:  3 As the YA (young adult) market grows, it continues to push at the historical boundaries by exploring controversial and edgy topics such as divorce, ethnicity, gender roles, suicide, and much more. It is also comprised of action-adventure, fantasy, historical, mystery, sci-fi, and speculative fiction. As a result, this has made it difficult to define YA fiction. This class, through exploration of many YA titles, will seek to define YA fiction. Is it a genre or sub genre? Are there different levels of YA fiction, or should there be? And why do adults love some YA titles and not others? Students will lead this industry discussion by developing a set of standards and criteria to define the genre through class discussions and projects.   GPP  7260 - MAINTAIN AND OPERATE SMALL PUBLISHING COMPANY Credits:  3 This course will give students hands-on experience in running a small publishing company. Through the course, students will follow the stages of publishing a book from acquisition, editorial, layout, design, promotion, marketing, and distribution. Students will actually publish a book that will sell on Amazon. Students will establish and manage a small "break even" or better budget.  GPP  7270 - BUSINESS OF PUBLISHING Credits:  3 This course will examine how publishing companies make money. Students will examine the daily financial, procedural, acquisition, etc. decisions publishers make on a daily basis. Students will study industry successes and failures to better understand how and why publishing companies succeed.
