A faculty of 15 greeted a group of 320 students who entered two-year programs in elementary and science education. Although the Normal School was originally privately owned, ownership was transferred to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1920, and the name was changed to East Stroudsburg State Normal School. In 1927, the right to confer the degrees of Bachelor of Science in education and Bachelor of Science in health education was granted, and the school became the State Teachers College at East Stroudsburg. In 1960, the name was changed to East Stroudsburg State College, reflecting the addition of liberal arts and science curricula. In November 1982, the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education was authorized by Act 188 of 1982, and the college officially became East Stroudsburg University on July 1, 1983.

However, some programs require specific tests, as follows: Graduate Degree Program  Required Examination  Athletic Training GRE Biology GRE Public Health GRE Communication Sciences and Disorders GRE    In addition to the requirements enumerated for all applicants to Graduate Studies, specific programs have additional application requirements, as follows: Graduate Degree Program  Additional Program Requirements  Special Education Supervisor Certification Teacher certification Reading Teacher certification Professional & Secondary Education Teacher certification     Fees and Deposits| 11  Financial Obligation Students, parents and others who are responsible for the financial obligations of students at East Stroudsburg University should understand that acceptance of admission and the privilege of attending imposes a financial obligation for a complete semester. Neither non-attendance, non-payment, nor failure to attend class constitutes official withdrawal. This must be done through the Student Enrollment Center using the appropriate form(s). Students who register online or in person can check their class schedule through the myESU student portal to confirm their registration. A semester/session e-bill will be sent to the student’s ESU email. Students will be held financially liable for their registration unless it is officially canceled when the student contacts the Student Enrollment Center. Non-payment of fees or other financial obligations will prevent a student from being allowed to register for subsequent academic work and from receiving any official transcript of their academic record or diploma from the university. Should the university find it necessary to refer a delinquent account to a collection agency or to an attorney, the cost of collection including attorney’s fees, if incurred, may be added to the student’s financial obligation. Student Payment Policy A student attending a course without proper registration and payment of all tuition and fees does not constitute de facto enrollment. The university will not permit retroactive enrollment in or payment for any class after the end of the term in which the course is offered. Graduate Students Taking Undergraduate Classes Please note that effective Fall 2012, tuition is assessed based on the student type and not course type. That is: • Graduate students taking graduate courses pay the graduate rate. • Graduate students taking undergraduate courses pay the graduate rate. • Graduate students taking both graduate and undergraduate courses pay the graduate rate. This can make a substantial difference in the charges for a graduate student. Please be sure to visit the Student Enrollment Center, Zimbar-Liljenstein Hall, to see how a schedule change in graduate/undergraduate credits will impact your charges. Graduate Tuition and Fees While subject to change without notice, the following tuition and fee amounts apply to all East Stroudsburg University graduate students at this time.  For Graduate Program Tuition and Fees see the Student Billing website at: esu.edu/tuition Insurance for Graduate Students Insurance for graduate students is available for full-time, U.S. citizens through the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs, located in the Reibman Administration Building.  Please contact the Office of Student Affairs at 570-422-3463. Guidelines for Determining Resident Status for Students (Title 22 Pennsylvania Code, Section 153.1) A student is classified as a Pennsylvania resident for tuition purposes if the student has a Pennsylvania domicile. A domicile is the place where one intends to and does, in fact, permanently reside. Because this decision is subjective, documentary evidence must be submitted to the Student Enrollment Center for consideration. Students who believe that they are qualified for in-state residency and those who would like to be made aware of the necessary factors to make such a transition should contact that office. Each case will be decided on the basis of all facts submitted with qualitative rather than quantitative emphasis in support of the intention of the student to reside indefinitely in Pennsylvania. If the student is not satisfied with the decision made by the Student Enrollment Center in response to the challenge, the student may make a written appeal to the Office of the Chancellor, State System of Higher Education, Dixon University Center, 2986 North Second Street, Harrisburg, "
PA 1711,"0. The decision on the challenge shall be final. Detailed Information on Fees General Fee This mandatory fee is used to support the university’s academic programs and a variety of student services and activities such as student government, student organizations, health services and wellness programs, and Student Center debt service, capital replacement, and maintenance. This fee is charged to all students (undergraduate and graduate, full-time and part-time, residential and commuting/off-campus) during all university sessions (including Winter Session and Summer Sessions), and at all course locations (including internships, student teaching, Dixon University Center in Harrisburg, and all other off-campus sites). Refunds of the General Fee during regular and special sessions will be processed in accordance with the same schedule and policy as tuition refunds. Technology Fee This mandatory fee was instituted by the State System Board of Governors in the fall of 2002 and is used to enhance student access to the latest technology in the classroom and to prepare students for a technology-driven world.  The purposes of the technology tuition fee are: (1) to acquire, install, and maintain up-to-date and emerging technologies to enhance student-learning outcomes; (2) to provide equitable access to technology resources; and (3) to ensure, ultimately, that ESU graduates are competitive in the technologically sophisticated workplace.  All hardware, software, databases, and Fees and Deposits 12| East Stroudsburg University 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog  other capital equipment procured with these revenues are to support student learning experiences such as smart classrooms, computer labs, technology-intensive scientific equipment, content management software, electronic media, library databases, distance learning hardware/software, web-course development cost, curriculum development costs for technology-based courses, student learning assessment, online student academic support services and security solutions to protect student and institutional data. Room and Board Each academic year an advance deposit of $200 is required, to be credited toward the second semester of that year. This deposit is non-refundable. Damage Charges Students are held responsible for damage, breakage, loss, or delayed return of university property. Damages that are determined to be communal will be prorated in accordance with university policy and housing contract agreement. Deliberate disregard for university property will also result in disciplinary action.  All keys to university rooms are university property and are loaned to students. Students who do not return keys will be charged a lock replacement fee to be determined by the institution. Loss of a room key should be reported immediately. Payment Information Payments may be made online, via mail, or in person at the Student Enrollment Center in Zimbar-Liljenstein Hall. ESU accepts bank or personal checks, debit cards and cash in office. Payments accepted on line are VISA, MasterCard, Discover and American Express, as well as electronic checks. Delinquent Accounts No student shall be enrolled, graduated, or granted a transcript of records or diploma until all previous charges have been paid. Refund Policies Students are encouraged to sign up for direct deposit. Otherwise, a check will be issued. Tuition A student who officially withdraws before the beginning of any semester is eligible for a complete refund of all fees EXCEPT the application fee and registration and room deposits. (Please refer to refund policies that pertain to housing and meal refunds, if applicable.) A student who completely withdraws from the university after the beginning of a semester and who submits to Student Enrollment Center an officially approved withdrawal form is entitled to a refund of tuition according to the schedule below. (Subject to change by the university without notice.) Refund  Period of Attendance  100 percent First week 80 percent Second week 60 percent Third week 50 percent Fourth week 40 percent Fifth week No refund after fifth week  Housing A student who officially withdraws completely from the university BEFORE the beginning of any semester is eligible to receive a full refund of housing fees, but must forfeit the housing deposit. A student who officially withdraws completely from the university DURING the semester will forfeit the housing deposit but is entitled to receive a pro-rated refund of housing fees, based upon a weekly scale. The Housing Office will determine if any refund of housing fees is possible for a student who leaves university housing for medical reasons. If a student is asked to leave university housing, the details concerning a housing refund shall be determined by the Director of Housing. Meals A student who officially withdraws after the beginning of a semester and who notifies the Student Enrollment Center will be entitled to a refund of the board paid for the remainder of the semester. A student who withdraws during a week will be charged for the entire week. Summer Sessions A refund of fees for a student who withdraws after the beginning of a summer session will be determined by the proportion of the term attended and will be prorated on the basis of the refund policy in effect for a regular session. It is the student's responsibility to submit withdrawal requests within the allotted time period. Academic Calendar| 13  Academic Calendar Fall 2018 Fall 2018 Bills Due August 20 Residence Halls Open (Freshmen & Transfer Students)    August 24 Residence Halls Open (Continuing Students) August 25  Fall Courses Begin August 27  Last Day to Drop Quarter 1 Course as No Grade August 30 Last Day to Add Quarter 1 Course August 30 Quarter 1 Withdrawal (W) Grade Period Begins August 31  Labor Day - No Classes    September 3  Classes Resume September 4  Last Day to Drop Semester Course as No Grade  September 4   Last Day to Add Semester Course   September 4  Semester Withdrawal (W) Grade Period Begins September 5  Priority Deadline to Submit "Intent to Graduate" Application for Fall 2018 Graduation (December) for Undergraduate and Graduate Students  September 17  Priority Deadline to Submit "Intent to Graduate" Application for Winter 2019 Graduation (January) for Undergraduate and Graduate Students  September 17  Family Weekend September 21 Last Day to Withdraw (W) from Quarter 1 Course   September 28 Homecoming  October 5  Columbus Day - No Classes   October 8  Midterm Grade Links Open for Faculty  October 8  Switch Day - Monday Schedule October 9  Quarter 1 Ends October 16 Quarter 2 Begins October 17 Faculty Deadline to Submit Midterm Grades to Registrar's Office by 9:00 AM October 18 Last Day to Drop Quarter 2 Course as No Grade October 20 Last Day to Add Quarter 2 Course October 20  Quarter 2 Withdrawal (W) Grade Period Begins October 21 Spring 2019 Registration Begins  October 29  Winter 2019 Registration Begins  October 29  Last Day to Withdraw (W) from Semester Course  October 31  Last Day to Withdraw (W) from Quarter 2 Course November 20  Thanksgiving Break Begins - No Classes November 21 Classes Resume November 26 Final Grade Links Open for Faculty December 6  Quarter 2 Ends December 7  Final Exam Week Begins  December 10 Fall Semester Ends December 14 Residence Halls Close December 14 Undergraduate & Graduate Commencement  December 15 Faculty Deadline to Submit Final Grades to Registrar's Office by 9:00 AM December 20 * Please note there is a separate Fall 2018 Extended Learning calendar.

These plans offers a flexible method for paying educational expenses from current income through regularly scheduled payments. Please contact the Bursar's Office at billing@esu.edu for more information. Student Loans The Student Enrollment Center, located in Zimbar-Liljenstein Hall, welcomes the opportunity to provide information and to assist students. The Financial Aid Office is located within this center. Please call 570-422-2800 or 1-800-378-6732 to schedule an appointment. Prospective graduate students should contact the Office of Financial Aid to discuss regulations and processes required in order to determine eligibility for loans and university student employment programs. The Office of Financial Aid administers the federal educational loan programs available to graduate students. Applicants must complete and submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students are encouraged to submit the FAFSA online at fafsa.ed.gov. Recipients must be enrolled in at least six credits of graduate-level class work and must maintain satisfactory academic progress (i.e. 3.0 Grade Point Average, 67% Pass Rate, Acceptable Completion Timeframe). Graduate students enrolled in graduate-level course work, may borrow up to a maximum of $20,500 per year in an unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan. Graduate students enrolled in undergraduate-level course work should contact the Student Enrollment Center to determine eligibility. Total borrowing amounts for the loan term, however, cannot exceed the cost of education less other financial assistance. After your completed application is received and processed, information from the FAFSA will be electronically transmitted to ESU. The Financial Aid Office will determine your financial aid eligibility. Once eligibility is determined, your financial aid awards will appear on your online portal. If a Direct Loan has been offered, you will need to take action in order for a loan to be originated. Online you may accept the full amount, partial amount or choose to decline the loan. If you are a first-time borrower, you will be required to complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) and entrance counseling. These can be completed online at studentloans.gov. Teacher Certification Students Students enrolled in a post-baccalaureate teacher certification program are eligible for Federal Direct Loans at the undergraduate level. Students simultaneously enrolled in a master’s degree program and teacher certification should check with the Office of Student Financial Aid in the Student Enrollment Center regarding their eligibility for student loans. Verification Requirements Verification is the process of comparing the data provided on the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) with other requested documentation such as a tax transcript. Much of the selection process is random. However, some students are selected because the information on the FAFSA is inconsistent. If a FAFSA is selected for verification the student will be sent instructions to begin the process, which can be completed online. If you have any questions or concerns about the verification process you can contact the Office of Student Financial Aid. Once the verification process is complete the student's financial aid can be processed. Failure to complete the verification process may result in the cancellation of all federal financial aid, and will result in an outstanding balance on the student's account. Verification may also result in a revision to any aid awarded prior to the completion of the verification process. Payment of Financial Aid Financial aid awards are credited directly to the student’s university account each semester. Refunds from financial aid will not become available until the student’s university account is satisfied. Students should plan to arrive on campus with enough personal money to purchase books and pay any off-campus housing expenses. Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy A student must maintain satisfactory academic progress (SAP) to continue to receive federal Title IV financial aid. Federal financial aid includes Federal Perkins Loan, Federal Direct Loans, and Graduate PLUS loans.  Federal standards of SAP include maintaining a 3.0 Grade Point Average, completing 67% of all courses enrolled, and a maximum time frame measurement to ensure the graduate program is completed in a timely manner. If one of the measures is not being met, the student is not meeting the standards and will no longer be eligible for federal financial aid. All periods of enrollment are included whether or not the student received federal financial aid during that time. SAP is measured at the end of each academic year, specifically the end of the Spring semester. Winter enrollment will be counted in your spring calculations. The option to submit a Financial Aid SAP Appeal is offered to students who experienced unforeseen and extenuating circumstances of which prevented them from being academically successful. This appeal submission requires documentation to support reason for appeal and must be submitted to the Office of Financial Aid by the required deadline. Financial Aid 20| East Stroudsburg University 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog  Graduate Students A student must meet all of the following requirements in order to be making satisfactory academic progress for Title IV aid. Qualitative Standard (GPA): • Graduate students (full or part-time) are required to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.00. • In addition to cumulative GPA requirements, graduate students in selected programs will not meet SAP requirements if they do not meet specific departmental standards related to “C” grades earned and/or clinical performance. At the end of each payment period (as identified above) the office of Graduate and Extended Studies will notify the Office of Student Financial Aid of any student in this circumstance. Quantitative (Pace) Standard: • Graduate students must complete a minimum percentage of attempted credits, Pass Rate. Students must maintain a minimum completion rate of 66.67%. • Pass Rate is calculated by dividing the cumulative credit hours earned by the cumulative credit hours attempted.  Maximum Time Frame: • Graduate students must complete degree requirements without exceeding 150% of the credit hours required. For example, a student enrolled in a 30 credit hour program will no longer be able to use federal financial aid once he/she has attempted 45 credit hours. Retaking coursework or coursework not required for program completion will affect the total number of attempted credit hours.   Program Completion: Once the student completes all the academic requirements for his/her program, the student is considered to have completed the degree program and is no longer eligible for further federal aid for that program. Students who fail to meet the GPA and Pass Rate standard at the end of the academic year will lose federal aid eligibility unless they successfully appeal and are placed on financial aid probation, with an academic plan.  Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Categories Financial Aid Appeal Process/ Financial Aid Probation: • If, at the end of the academic year, a student is not meeting SAP requirements, the student may submit an appeal based on extenuating circumstances. Examples of extenuating circumstances are personal illness or injury, a death of a close relative, or other special circumstances. The appeal must outline the reasons that satisfactory academic progress was not met, what has changed that will allow the minimum standards to be met at the next evaluation and how the student plans to improve their academic progress (i.e. academic plan). The reasons for being academically unsuccessful must be supported with documentation.  • If the appeal is approved by the financial aid office, the student will be placed on academic probation, with an academic plan, and will be eligible for federal financial aid during a financial aid probationary period. The student’s progress will be monitored to determine the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan. If the student is meeting the requirements of the academic plan, the student will be eligible to receive federal aid as long as the student continues to meet the requirements and is reviewed according to the requirements specified in the plan. • If the appeal is denied, the student will not be eligible for federal financial aid until he/she is meeting satisfactory academic progress standards (i.e. GPA, Pass Rate, Max Hours).  Students will be notified, in writing, by the East Stroudsburg University Office of Student Financial Aid if they have been approved for federal financial aid due to a successful SAP Appeal submission. Academic Forgiveness Graduate students do not qualify for Academic Forgiveness at this time. Transfer Credits Transfer credits accepted toward the student’s current program are counted as both attempted and completed credit hours. Grades earned in transfer credits are not included in cumulative GPA.  Simultaneous Enrollment in Undergraduate and Graduate Classes ESU and the federal government use different rules and regulations to classify students as undergraduate or graduate. If a graduate student enrolled in a graduate degree program takes six credit hours of undergraduate course work and only three credit hours of graduate course work, the student is considered an undergraduate student and is only eligible for the maximum amount of federal aid for undergraduate students. There is a significant difference in the amount of federal loan aid available to an undergraduate student and a graduate student. Students who are classified as graduate students in fall and undergraduate students in spring may find that they are only eligible for a small fraction of the federal loan that they would be eligible for in spring if they were classified as graduate students. Certification-Only Students Students enrolled in post-baccalaureate certification programs and not simultaneously enrolled in a graduate degree program may not be eligible for federal aid. Check with the Office of Student Financial Aid to determine your eligibility for federal financial aid. Scholarships Scholarships based upon a variety of achievements and talents are available at East Stroudsburg University. Funds for the various scholarship areas are made available through donations by private industry, faculty, staff, community contributions, and private endorsements. Additional information on scholarships is available online at esu.edu. Graduate Assistantships| 21  Overview of the Graduate Assistantship Program Graduate & Extended Studies at East Stroudsburg University offers an excellent graduate assistantship program. The primary purpose of the program is to enhance the student's academic experience while pursuing a graduate degree at ESU. Therefore, graduate assistantships are available to attract the "best and brightest" prospective students to ESU graduate programs and to provide highly qualified graduate students with professional development experiences related to research and leadership in their field of study. Graduate assistants function under the auspices of graduate faculty on academic, clinical, research, or leadership activities or special projects related to the field of graduate study. Graduate assistant appointments are awarded on a competitive basis to highly qualified students without regard to financial need. Therefore, the awarding of a graduate assistantship is an honor as well as a scholarship.  Graduate Studies is the designated unit on campus to officially offer graduate assistantships to students, based upon the recommendation of an academic department. Finally, a graduate assistant at all times is subject to all existing and any new policies, procedures, and rules that arise during the term of award and assistantships are based on available funding. Graduate and Extended Studies offers a variety of graduate assistantships, categorized as follows: • Academic or research graduate assistantships are available to highly qualified graduate students in any degree program. Academic graduate assistants are assigned to function under the auspices of a faculty member in their department. Responsibilities include academic, clinical, or research activities related to the field of study. • Administrative graduate assistantships are available on a limited basis to highly qualified graduate students from any degree program. • Frederick Douglass Institute graduate assistantships are named after Frederick Douglass, the 19th-century American abolitionist. Consideration for this scholarship is in keeping with the spirit of Douglass' life of public service and the university's mission to be a source of encouragement to historically underrepresented and underserved populations who have a commitment to leadership, social involvement, and commitment to education, as evidence by their professional experiences or professional goals. Frederick Douglass Institute graduate assistantships are open to applicants with a record of academic achievement and scholarship who demonstrate potential for leadership and ability to promote unity in a civil society. Students with Frederick Douglass Institute graduate assistantships will be assigned to function under the auspices of graduate faculty in an academic department or administrators to enhance their leadership skills and serve the Frederick Douglass Institute. • Residence life graduate assistantships are available on a limited basis to qualified, full-time graduate students in any degree program. Residence life graduate assistants are assigned to and receive room in one of the university residence halls and provide services as needed by the Office of Residence Life and Housing in the management of the residence halls. Residence life graduate assistantships require availability one week before and after the academic semester, as well as on evenings and weekends throughout the semester.

Award of a Graduate Assistantship Applicants for a Graduate Assistantship are notified of their selection and offer of an assistantship by a letter from the Graduate Studies office. The Graduate Assistantship Award Letter will outline the details of the award. Graduate Assistantships may be offered for an academic year, a semester (fall/spring), or a summer session, with award levels as follows: • Full Graduate Assistantship (100 percent) • Partial Graduate Assistantship (75 percent) • Partial Graduate Assistantship (50 percent) Typically, applicants will be notified of an offer for the fall semester or an academic year in May, June, July, or August; for the spring semester in November or December; and for the summer session in May or June. Late appointments may be made due to changes in award availability, resignations, or dismissals. Upon receipt of an offer, applicants are expected to follow the guidelines, as stipulated in the award letter, to accept the offer. Failure to complete all requirements by the due dates will result in forfeiture of the offer of a graduate assistantship. Finally, of important note, while graduate faculty in academic departments and administrators may recommend applicants for a graduate assistantship, only Graduate Studies can authorize the awarding of a graduate assistantship. Therefore, applicants should await an official offer letter from the graduate director. Professional Duties The award of a graduate assistantship includes professional duties performed under the supervision of a graduate faculty or administrator. The Graduate Assistantship Award Letter will specify the name and position of the graduate faculty or administrator and the unit in which the duties are to be performed. The extent of hours will be specified, commensurate with the award level, as follows: • Full Graduate Assistantship (100 percent) – 20 hours per week (600 hours per academic year; or 300 hours per semester) • Partial Graduate Assistantship (75 percent) – 15 hours per week (450 hours per academic year; or 225 hours per semester) • Partial Graduate Assistantship (50 percent) – 10 hours per week (300 hours per academic year; or 150 hours per semester) Graduate assistants are expected to meet with their supervisor before the start of the assistantship to discuss professional expectations and work duties. Graduate assistants are expected to perform assigned professional responsibilities and demonstrate good work habits. Additionally, graduate assistants are expected to maintain good academic standing and satisfactory progress toward their degree. Compensation Graduate assistantships provide financial compensation for the work or professional duties performed. The total amount of the compensation correlates with the award level, as follows: • Full Graduate Assistantship (100 percent) $5,004 per academic year; or $2,502 per semester • Partial Graduate Assistantship (75 percent) $3,753 per academic year; or $1,876 per semester • Partial Graduate Assistantship (50 percent) $2,502 per academic year; or $1,251 per semester Graduate assistants are compensated for the work performed on an hourly basis, paid on a biweekly schedule.

However, customary with professional standards of practice, a letter or resignation and advance notice are preferred to allow for transition of the position. If the resignation occurs during the course of an academic semester, compensation and tuition waiver will be pro-rated to the date of the resignation. A student who resigns a graduate assistantship position in good standing may reapply and accept another award in the future if eligibility criteria are met. Graduate assistants are expected to follow all university policies and procedures in fulfillment of their work and academic responsibilities. Failure to perform professional duties, demonstrate good work habits, maintain good academic standing, or follow university policies and procedures will result in corrective or disciplinary measures, from mentoring and coaching to potential termination of the graduate assistantship award. Overview of the Graduate Student Worker Program Graduate & Extended Studies at East Stroudsburg University offers an excellent graduate student worker program. The primary purpose of the Graduate Student Worker Program is to provide university departments and units a student workforce in specific job areas and to support the students’ need to obtain practical work experience. Positions requested must reflect a need for a highly specialized trained student with advanced knowledge of the work field. Graduate Student Workers need to possess a highly maintained set of technical skills and should be working in a field related to their academic pursuit. Graduate & Extended Studies is the designated unit on campus to offer Graduate Student Worker positions to departments and other units on campus. Graduate Student Worker positions do not include tuition waivers. The Request for a Graduate Student Worker Position is a request for a GSW position for the current year only. If a unit is awarded a GSW position, then the review of graduate student worker applications or recommendation of a current graduate student for the position will follow. Once again, the office of Graduate Studies is the designated unit to make an official offer of a Graduate Student Worker to a student. To be eligible to receive a Graduate Student Worker position, graduate students must be admitted into a graduate program, enrolled in a minimum of 5 credits, and in academic good standing.  New students who have not yet established academic standing in Graduate and Extended Studies are required to have a 3.00 GPA as an undergraduate, both overall and in their major. A full-time Graduate Student Worker position offers a graduate student 20 hours of work experiences per week (300 hours per semester, or 600 hours per academic year) with a stipend between $8.34-$15.00/ an hour.  A half-time Graduate Student Worker position offers a graduate student 10 hours of work experiences per week (150 hours per semester, or 300 hours per academic year) with a stipend between $8.34-$15.00/ an hour.

The master’s degree programs traverse each of the university’s four colleges – College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business and Management, College of Education, and College of Health Sciences. Credit Requirements Most M.A., M.Ed., and M.S. degree programs require 30 to 36 credit hours of coursework beyond the baccalaureate level; however, the number of credit hours required for the master’s degree varies with the type of degree and whether the student is required to write a thesis. Some clinically-based Master of Science (M.S.) programs, and professional master’s degrees, such as the Master of Public Heath (M.P.H.), require 42 credit hours or more. Many of these degrees, however, do not require the student to complete a thesis. Academic Major and Concentration The academic major represents the sequence of courses and experiences constituting the major field of study and culminating in the master’s degree. Some academic majors or programs of study offer the student the opportunity to select a concentration (e.g., focused area of study, track, specialization, emphasis) within the major field. Program Option Many of ESU's master’s degree programs offer the student the opportunity to select a program option, typically a thesis or non-thesis option. Admission to Candidacy All master’s degree students who received an admission decision of Admission, Pre-Candidacy are expected to submit a Plan of Study before the completion of 12 credit hours. Subsequent to submission of the Plan of Study, students are reviewed for Admission to Candidacy. To be admitted to candidacy, a student must be in Academic Good Standing and have fulfilled any requirements stated by the department or director of Graduate & Extended Studies. Master’s degree students who received an admission decision of Admission, with Conditions must first fulfill all conditions, as stated on the admission decision letter, and have their status upgraded to Admission, Pre-Candidacy in order to be reviewed for Admission to Candidacy. A master’s degree candidate must remain in academic good standing in order to be eligible to graduate. In-Residence and Transfer Credits Individual graduate programs at ESU may establish requirements for credits taken "in residence" and transfer credits, allowing up to one-third of the credits meeting program requirements to be accepted as transfer credits. Graduate programs that wish to allow the acceptance of more than six transfer credits, up to one-third of the credits meeting program requirements, must follow the process for approval of program requirements/transfer credits to set the higher limit of transfer credits for the program. Transfer credits must have been completed at a regionally accredited institution, within the past six years, and the grade earned must be at least a "B" or its equivalent. Also, the credits must not have been utilized to fulfill requirements for a degree earned at that institution. Transfer credits must be approved and incorporated in the Plan of Study. Culminating Experiences All master’s degree programs at ESU require a culminating experience. This requirement may be met through a thesis, research project, or comprehensive examination, or in some cases this requirement can be met through integrative experiences, such as practicum, internships, and other field work that synthesize theory and practice. Graduate & Extended Studies outlines the process and timeline for all culminating experiences. Failure to adhere to guidelines may delay a student's graduation. Application for Graduation All candidates for the master’s degree are required to submit a complete and approved Application for Graduation during the semester in which program completion and graduation are anticipated, as follows: Anticipated Graduation  Application Due Date May February 15 August May 9 December September 15 Statute of Limitations All program requirements for a master’s degree, including program credits earned or accepted by transfer, examinations, internships or field experiences, and research requirements must be completed within six years from the date on initial registration in the program. A leave of absence may be requested for professional or personal reasons; the time during the leave of absence does not count toward the maximum timeframe for completing degree requirements. An extension to the statute of limitation for program completion may be requested; the extension must be submitted and fully approved before the expiration of the six-year maximum timeframe. Academic Regulations Academic Regulations| 25  Dual Graduate Degree For awarding two dual graduate degrees at least 12 hours will be required beyond the minimal credit requirement for the degree program with the most required credits. Second Master’s Degree Post-masters students returning for a second master’s degree need to complete an additional 15 credits (regardless of number of earned credits for the first master’s degree) and complete degree requirements in effect at time of matriculation for second master’s degree. General Policies Academic Integrity Policy East Stroudsburg University is committed to promoting a climate of openness and honesty among all members of the university community. In order to foster an environment suitable for the development of academic excellence, it is imperative that all members of the academic community uphold the principles of academic integrity in all scholarly endeavors. Academic integrity implies that students are solely responsible for their work and actions while members of the ESU community. In accordance with this pursuit, students are responsible for knowing the rules and conditions under which university credit may legitimately be obtained. Violations of academic honesty will be viewed with the utmost seriousness and appropriate sanctions will be applied. It shall be deemed an academic offense if a student commits any of the following: • During a test or examination, uses any material not authorized by the instructor. • Provides or receives assistance in an examination, test, assignment, paper or project in a manner not authorized by the instructor. • Buys, sells, engages in unauthorized exchange, or uses any tests or examinations in advance of their administration. • Buys, sells, engages in unauthorized exchange or improperly using any assignments, papers or projects. • Presents as his or her own, for academic credit, the ideas or works of another person(s), scholastic, literary or artistic, in whole or in part, without proper and customary acknowledgment of sources, and in a manner which represents the work to be his or her own. • Falsifies or invents information, data, or research material. • Obtains information in a way contrary to the stated policies of the course, and/or the university as stated herein. • Attempts to bribe or coerce any university employee or student in order to gain academic advantage. • Colludes with others in order to circumvent academic requirements. • Substitutes for another student, or arranges for substitution by another student, or misrepresents oneself as another person during a test or examination whether in person or using electronic or telephonic communication. • Alters, changes, or forges university academic records, or forges faculty, staff, or administrative signatures on any university form or letter. • Submits any false record in pursuit of university credit. Standards of Behavior The mission and objectives of the university include a serious concern for the overall development of the individual. This philosophy implies that all students maintain high personal standards and conduct themselves in a manner, which manifests not only intellectual and emotional growth but also personal and social development. The basic standards of behavior are outlined in the Student Handbook, under the Judicial Process and Regulations and the Student Code of Conduct. Academic Good Standing Graduate and post-baccalaureate students at East Stroudsburg University are expected to maintain high academic standards. All graduate and post-baccalaureate students must maintain a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 3.00 or higher in all coursework in order to be in academic good standing. In the first 6 credits of a graduate program (early pre-candidacy), an overall GPA of 2.50 or higher will be accepted as academic good standing. A graduate student must be in academic good standing to be admitted to degree candidacy and to graduate. Some graduate and post-baccalaureate programs may have more stringent requirements for academic good standing. Academic Probation and Dismissal Students who fall below academic good standing are placed on academic probation. Students placed on academic probation must raise their cumulative grade point average (GPA) to 3.00 or higher within the next nine credit hours. Students who fail to raise their cumulative average to at least 3.00 by the end of their probation period will be dismissed from their program, as well as from Graduate & Extended Studies. Academic Dismissal Return:  "All applicants seeking to be (re)admitted to graduate study after being previously dismissed must include a written statement explaining the reason(s) why their application should be considered." Course Repeats Graduate students are required to earn a grade of “C” or higher in all coursework in order to progress in their program of study and in Graduate & Extended Studies, with a maximum of three grades of “C” across the program. Students may repeat only one course for grade improvement for each graduate program. The course may be repeated one time, for a total of two attempts. If a student has not earned a grade of “C” or higher after a second attempt, then the student will be dismissed from the graduate program and Graduate & Extended Studies. Credits for a repeated course will be counted only once, and the hours and grade earned when the course was last taken will be used to compute the grade point average. However, all attempts will continue to appear on the transcript. Some graduate programs may have more stringent requirements for course grades and course repeats. 26| East Stroudsburg University 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog  Post-baccalaureate Students Post-baccalaureate students are expected to earn a grade of “C” or higher in all coursework, graduate and undergraduate, in their post-baccalaureate career. Post-baccalaureate students may repeat up to two courses for grade improvement. Each course may be repeated one time, for a total of two attempts. If a student has not earned a grade of “C” or higher after a second attempt, then the student will be dismissed from the post-baccalaureate program and Graduate & Extended Studies. Credits for a repeated course will be counted only once, and the hours and grade earned when the course was last taken will be used to compute the grade point average. However, all attempts will continue to appear on the transcript. Grading System and Quality Points In addition to meeting course and credit requirements for graduation, students must maintain a specified academic level throughout a given curriculum as measured by quality points. The minimum number of quality points required for graduation is twice the number of credits attempted. Work completed at other colleges and accepted as transfer credit is not considered in computing the grade point average.  Each credit grade is calculated as follows: Grade Symbol  Quality Points  A 4.000 A- 3.667 B+ 3.333 B 3.000 B- 2.667 C+ 2.333 C 2.000 C- 1.667 D 1.000 E 0 Calculating of grade point average is done using the steps below. 1. Grade symbols are translated into quality points per credit as listed above. 2. The university recognizes that a good grade in a 3-semester-hour course requires more work than in a 2-semester-hour course. Owing to this, the university follows a system which recognizes both the quality and quantity of a student's work.  3. Under this system, the number of quality points for each letter grade (e.g. four points for an “A”) is multiplied by the number of credits for the course. 4. For example, an “A” in a three-semester-hour course earns a total of 12 quality points. To find out a student's quality point average, divide the total number of quality points by the total number of credits scheduled. This average considers both the quality and quantity of work. 5. Quality points are awarded only for work completed at East Stroudsburg University. Work completed at other colleges and accepted as transfer credit is not considered in computing the quality point average. Grade Reports Student grade reports are available at mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Only the end-of-semester grades are entered on the student’s permanent records (transcript). Semester grade reports are available through the student portal myESU. Specific information about access to the student portal is mailed to each student upon his or her initial enrollment at East Stroudsburg University. It is the responsibility of each student to check grade reports at mid-semester and at the end of the semester. Students are expected to check grade reports as they are available to be aware of academic performance in each course, to register for courses for the next semester, and to address issues related to course grades immediately. Grade reports are an important tool for assessing academic progress. Course Withdrawal Course withdrawals, subject to the conditions described below, may be accomplished by completing a Drop Card and obtaining the instructor’s signature. Withdrawals must be officially recorded at the Student Enrollment Center. Any student who discontinues attendance in a course without formally withdrawing will be assigned a final grade of “E.” During the first week of the semester a student may withdraw from a course and have no record of that course appear on the student’s permanent record. After the first week through the 10th week, a student who withdraws will receive a grade of W for that course on the student’s permanent record. After the 10th week the student may withdraw only if there are extraordinary circumstances (e.g., illness, death in the family, etc.). In this situation the student must also secure the graduate dean’s signature on the drop card. A grade of “W” will be assigned if the student is passing; “Z” will be assigned if the student is failing. Time periods for withdrawals during a semester and summer session are as follows: Withdrawal Action  Withdrawal Time Period   Semester  3-week session  6-week session NO RECORD 1st week 1st day 2 days ‘W’ GRADE: 2nd-10th week 2nd day–2nd week 3rd day –4th week NO WITHDRAWAL: 11th -15th week 3rd week 5th – 6th weeks Academic Regulations| 27  Incomplete Grades The maximum time for completing course requirements to remove incomplete grades is one year from the end of the session in which the “I” grade was assigned. After that time, the “I” grade will automatically be converted by the registrar to an “E,” “F,” or “U” based on the grade mode for the course. The student can then only earn credits for the course by registering for it again in another term. If a student applies for graduation in a session before the one-year period has expired, the course requirements must be completed by the end of that session, or the I grade will be converted by the registrar to an “E,” “F,” or “U.” A faculty member who chooses to deviate from this policy will require the student to sign a contract specifying conditions necessary for course completion, which may include a time period for completion of less than one year or other conditions. Students registered for thesis credits will be assigned the letter "O" (Ongoing) instead of “I” while completing their research. Ongoing Grades Students registered for thesis credits will be assigned the letter "O" (Ongoing) instead of "I" while completing their research. Course Auditing Graduate students may audit a course if permission has been granted by the course instructor (Permission to Audit card). Auditors must pay normal tuition and related fees. A change of registration from credit to audit or from audit to credit may occur only during the first week of the semester. An auditor will, with permission from the instructor, participate in class discussion, do practicum work, take examinations, and share generally in the privileges of a class member. If the student completes all course requirements, an "audit" notation is posted to the student’s academic record. No student who is required to carry a certain number of credits may count among those credits the credit for an audited course. Dual-Level Courses Graduate students who enroll in dual-level courses as graduate credit should be aware that dual-level courses commonly require more advanced work and additional requirements than required of undergraduate students taking the same course. Dual-level courses with graduate credit taken while a student was an undergraduate may be approved for the graduate program if the course did not count toward the requirements for the baccalaureate degree. Academic Correspondence Correspondence from the office of Graduate & Extended Studies to graduate students is mailed to the permanent address of record or university e-mail account. Therefore, graduate students are required to notify Graduate & Extended Studies of any changes in mailing address and other contact information on a timely basis. Commencement For December Graduate Commencement, graduate students who have fulfilled all program requirements are eligible to participate. For May Graduate Commencement, graduate students who have fulfilled all program requirements are eligible to participate.  Graduate students enrolled in cohort programs which conclude in the Summer Session, and who are in academic good standing and who have been admitted to candidacy, are eligible to participate.  Graduate students in other programs, who are in academic good standing, have been admitted to candidacy, and scheduled to complete their degree program in Summer Session, are eligible to participate. All graduation applications require departmental approval. 28| East Stroudsburg University 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog  Opportunities for participation in co-curricular activities at the university are virtually unlimited. Learning outside the classroom is considered to be an integral part of the student’s personal growth and development. Alumni Engagement The Office of Alumni Engagement, as part of the East Stroudsburg University Foundation, works to support and engage a network of more than 45,000 ESU alumni.

Office of Accessible Services Individualized for Students (OASIS) East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania believes that an individual’s access to opportunities for achievement and personal fulfillment must be determined solely on the basis of the person’s ability and interest. OASIS at East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania provides accommodations and services to students with documented disabilities (i.e., specific learning disabilities, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, chronic illnesses, mobility impairments, deaf/hard of hearing, blind/low vision, psychiatric disabilities, traumatic brain injuries and other disabilities not specified) that result in substantial limitation of a major life activity. The faculty members in OASIS provide basic services and facilities accommodations for eligible students with disabilities who self-identify with a disability, provide appropriate supporting documentation and request services. Students who request accommodations are responsible for initiating the process with OASIS and for requesting academic or environmental accommodations. OASIS asks that individuals requesting services (accommodations and/or access) complete the self-disclosure and request for services form, including a description of the student’s disability, the disability’s likely impact on your educational experiences and the successful use of accommodations in the past. These forms are available online at the Office of Accessible Services Individualized for Students (OASIS). Academic accommodations allow equal access to academic programs and include classroom and assessment accommodations, and are based on the evaluation process, a student’s course of study and current functional limitations. The evaluation process includes a review of the self-disclosure and request form, supporting documentation, an interview with the student, and the assessment of the student’s program of study during the first semester the student requests services. In order to fully evaluate requests for accommodations or adjustments, East Stroudsburg University requests supporting documentation, which can be valuable in the deliberative process of providing accommodations and/or access to the educational environment. Supporting documentation can include medical records, psycho-educational testing, school records that specify the impact the disability has on physical, perceptual, cognitive, and behavioral activities, and/or past records of accommodations and services. Intake interviews usually occur during the first semester the individual with a disability requests services and attends classes. During this interview, accommodations and assistive technology needs are determined. The Office of Disabilities Services also provides an Assistive Technologist, who is available to instruct students in various assistive technologies to help students with their academic studies. After the interview meeting with the faculty member in the Office of Disability Services, the student is given a letter of accommodation listing the academic accommodations and/or assistive technology the student is entitled to use for each class. The student is responsible to provide a copy of this letter of accommodation to the professor of each class at the beginning of the semester. Some frequently used 32| East Stroudsburg University 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog  academic accommodations and assistive technology devices include, but are not limited to: • Extended time on exam • Student note taking • Reader/scribe for exams • Exams taken on computer • Textbooks in alternative format • Computer access programs Environmental accommodations provide equal access to facilities and may include housing and parking accommodations. Environmental accommodations are based on a student’s current functional limitations and the evaluative process. Please review the procedure to receive services for more information.

Through a well-integrated program of study, students receive instruction in the core public health disciplines of: • Biostatistics • Environmental Health • Epidemiology • Public Health Administration • Social & Behavioral Sciences The MPH program provides students with a variety of opportunities to study the intersection of the social behavioral sciences, information technology, human behavior, organizational and community systems, and policy development. With the focus in Community Health Education, graduates are eligible to sit for the Certified Health Education Specialist (CHES) exam. This certification indicates that they have the requisite skills in developing, planning, implementing and evaluating programs. Our MPH program is accredited by CEPH; thus, students are also eligible to sit for the Certification in Public Health (CPH) exam. National Accreditation The MPH program is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH) through 2020. CEPH is the independent agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education to accredit schools of public health and certain public health programs. CEPH accreditation attests to the quality of an educational program that prepares professionals for entry into the public health field. Accreditation also provides assurance to students that the school or program has been evaluated and has met accepted quality standards established by and within the profession. Our accreditation provides potential employers with assurances that our training program covers the essential public health skills and knowledge needed for achieving success in today’s public health arena. Mission Statement The faculty are heavily involved in scholarly service to the field of public health as well as conducting research to facilitate solving public health problems. Faculty members conduct this work at the national, state and local level. Examples of faculty research include: social marketing strategies and tobacco control; the use of social marketing and social media in improving health literacy; evaluating asthma and diabetes prevention programs; providing technical assistance and evaluation/outcomes research in chronic disease prevention; conducting community-based substance abuse prevention initiatives; using health informatics and information technology applications in public health and prevention, to name a few. Faculty members are actively engaged in research and seek to collaborate with graduate assistants and other students. A number of these students, some supported by research assistantships, are integrally involved in these projects.  PROGRAM OF STUDY The Master of Public Health degree in Public Health and Community Health Education is a 45-credit program that includes a six-credit (300 hours) internship requirement and a requirement to conduct research resulting in a publishable quality paper. Because the program combines traditional public health course work with professional training in community health education, graduates are well prepared to work in a variety of public health settings, or continue on for doctorate work. Graduates work in program development, implementation, and evaluation of population based prevention programs to promote healthy behaviors and prevent disease as well as developing health policies that protect citizens from risk factors associated with negative health outcomes. Students who enter the program typically have backgrounds in a variety of social service occupations with undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in the social behavioral sciences (such as health education, psychology, anthropology or sociology), as well as nursing, medicine, biology, and various other fields. No specific undergraduate degree is required for admission. 102| East Stroudsburg University 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS Required courses: "
