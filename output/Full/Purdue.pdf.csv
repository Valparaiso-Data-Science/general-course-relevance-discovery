BIOL 3120,"0 - Great Issues Genomics And Society  Credit Hours: 3.00. The course will revolve around genomics, the science and technology involved in determining the sequence of the entire DNA complement in an organism. Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences - mostly because it touches on all areas of study. The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College of Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind? What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications. In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.  "

MGMT 6870,"0 - Design For Instincts: Social Networks and Engagements  Credit Hours: 1.00 to 3.00. This course will build on design thinking and game design techniques to develop process, policies, and/or products that appeal to human instincts. We will cover ideas that provide insights into, for example, new product development, entrepreneurship or designing HR policies. To name a few examples of projects we will discuss, SAP's points-based system to encourage carpooling that helps the company save on large gas expenses; at challenge.gov, the Whitehouse encourages innovative solutions through crowdsourcing; and at companies like Google, and Best-Buy, employees participate in information assimilation games called prediction markets providing information to senior managers about ongoing projects. In this course, you will examine the mechanisms behind designing for human instincts and thereby developing an understanding of their effective use in the modern firm. Gamification is one form of design for human instincts. In order for any design to be effective, it should involve clearly defined strategies and wellmanaged execution. To identify effective strategies, and metrics for the application of techniques to business, this course will draw upon interdisciplinary source material as well as real-world case studies. It will also identify a number of significant pitfalls to techniques, as well as notable legal and ethical issues, and the problems with implementing radical change in established firms.

POL 3350,"0 - China And The Challenges Of Globalization  Credit Hours: 3.00. Globalization is a very popular topic, resulting in a lot of loose and poorly thought-through talk and writing around the subject. The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the "century of shame." Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.  "
