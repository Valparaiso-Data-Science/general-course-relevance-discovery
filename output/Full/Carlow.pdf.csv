Founded in 1929 by the Sisters of Mercy, Carlow offers a liberal arts curriculum across all majors to prepare women and men for leadership in the 21st century. With an enrollment of more than 2,200 graduate and undergraduate students, Carlow is committed to providing its students with individual attention, a supportive academic environment, and career development. Located in a culturally diverse urban setting, Carlow’s 15-acre campus neighbors the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. A member of the Conference for Mercy Higher Education, Carlow is recognized for educating traditional students and adult learners for a lifetime of learning, leadership, and service.  • Founded in September 1929 as Mount Mercy College   • University status awarded in 2004   • Catholic/Liberal Arts • 2,140 students   • 84 percent female/16 percent male   • Diverse student body   • 12:1 student–faculty ratio   • 27 undergraduate majors • 16 graduate majors • 2 doctoral programs    CARLOW UNIVERSITY VISION  Carlow University will be a preeminent, innovative, Catholic university, renowned for providing transformational learning experiences in which students realize their full potential and become career-ready ethical leaders committed to a just and merciful world.  CARLOW UNIVERSITY MISSION  Carlow University, rooted in its Catholic identity and embodying the heritage and values of the Sisters of Mercy, offers transformational educational opportunities for a diverse community of learners, empowering them to excel in their chosen work as compassionate, responsible leaders in the creation of a just and merciful world.  VALUES  MERCY  The identifying value of Carlow University is Mercy, encompassing all that we are and do as a university. Inspired by our God of Mercy, this value urges us to open our hearts to our students, our colleagues, and our world. In the tradition of action and contemplation, we seek practical ways of addressing need, as we engage in reflection to understand and integrate our experiences. Education offers us the tools to recognize and address unjust structures and dehumanizing situations. Each discipline provides a lens through which we can envision our place in our own personal transformation and that of the global community. The values of Service, Discovery, Hospitality, and the Sacredness of Creation further expand our understanding of the power of Mercy to change our world.  HOSPITALITY  In Hospitality, we welcome the wholeness of each person, creating a space in our campus community for all individuals with their varied beliefs, cultures, orientations, and abilities. Openness to the gifts and perspectives of all creates a community rich in diversity and committed to inclusion.  SERVICE  The value of Service calls us beyond ourselves to place the needs of others over our own self-interest. Our efforts to  identify and respond to the needs we see around us lead us to interact with persons and institutions in ways that are transformational. Our spirit of compassion leads us to practical action on behalf of those in need.   9 DISCOVERY  Through Discovery we open ourselves to the totality of our human experience, to the educational enterprise, to our relationship with the Divine, and to the wonders of the world in which we find ourselves. Discovery energizes our intellectual curiosity and desire for learning. It leads us ever deeper in the engagement with our chosen discipline and engenders a spirit of awe at the complexity and variety of creation.  SACREDNESS OF CREATION  This value leads us to a respect for each person and for all of creation. In gratitude for the beauty and variety of our world and its inhabitants, we commit to a culture of sustainability and to the preservation of a world where all are reverenced and all may thrive.  PHILOSOPHY STATEMENT  The philosophy of Carlow University is guided by a commitment to the Catholic Intellectual Tradition, a belief in the transformative power of the liberal arts, and a dedication to undergraduate and graduate education that instills social responsibility and a desire to work for the good of all humankind. These ideals are touchstones of a Carlow education, informing the institution’s mission and values so that students can realize their full potential and become ethical leaders in their personal and professional lives, committed to a just and merciful world.  Rooted in the Catholic Intellectual Tradition, Carlow University recognizes the dignity of all human persons and the value of all creation, and understands that genuine wisdom and knowledge yield imperatives for justice. As a result, the institution seeks to graduate individuals who become engaged citizens of the world, capable of establishing transformative relationships of compassion and empathy. The love of learning and the desire for God are understood to manifest themselves in the relationship between reason and faith. Catholic Intellectual Tradition posits that truth is not divided, that truth in science is not at odds with truth in religion; thus, at Carlow, truth is explored through a “both/and” (analogical) rather than an “either/or” (dialectical) approach. Understanding that no single academic discipline contains all truth, Carlow University promotes an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach to research and scholarship, believing that creative, imaginative attentiveness to the world requires applying complex methods of interpreting that world.   This attentiveness to the world is also evident in the university’s belief in the transformative power of the liberal arts. Derived from the Latin word liber for “free,” the liberal arts have been the foundation of higher education for centuries because they free individuals to think clearly and creatively about themselves and the world in which they live. Carlow is committed to the liberal arts as part of its undertaking to educate the whole person: body, mind, and spirit. Fundamentally, the liberal arts focus on what it means to be human, in all humanity’s complexity. Rather than approaching human experience from a finite perspective or insisting on rigid viewpoints that inhibit knowledge or limit thinking, the liberal arts encourage intellectual exploration and often pose problems that have no easy solutions. When students engage with the essential issues explored in the liberal arts, their lives are transformed, and they leave the institution ready to help transform society through their ability to comprehend and address the complex challenges of the world.  A commitment to transforming the world flows from the values of the founders of Carlow University. When the Sisters of Mercy launched Mount Mercy College in 1929, they were pioneers for women’s higher education by combining scholarship in the liberal arts with career development in the professions, thus providing young women in the Pittsburgh area equal educational opportunities with men.   The Sisters of Mercy were inspired by their founder Catherine McAuley, whose social reform efforts recognized the inherent dignity of women, and helped those women become self-directing and self-sustaining. As Carlow began to admit male veterans after World War II, it was clear that an educational approach that values women is beneficial to both male and female students. Such an approach champions the inherent worth of all voices, creating a pedagogical and scholarly environment that includes those who have been historically excluded. The Mercy approach to teaching and scholarship, which emphasizes inclusion, flexibility, and collaboration, creates a campus culture where men and women experience empathy and mutual respect. In practice, the university’s philosophy leads to undergraduate and graduate pedagogy and curricula rooted in social justice, requiring Carlow students and graduates to challenge or affirm prevailing values in the workplace and the world. Through course work, research, internships, and residencies, Carlow students embody the integrative Mercy approach to rigorous scholarship, creative thinking, and problem solving. Through the innovative liberal arts core experience, undergraduate students develop creative and critical reasoning skills essential to any professional, vocational, or personal situation. The original vision of the founders uniquely positions Carlow University today to offer an educational experience in which its graduates seek integrity in their lives and have the skills and conviction to create a more just and merciful world.

The Financial Aid Office administers federal, state, and institutional aid programs, and offers assistance to students and parents with questions about the financial aid process. All students are encouraged to utilize www.carlow.edu and myPortal for current financial aid information and to access all forms necessary to apply for financial aid.  HOW FINANCIAL AID IS AWARDED   All financial aid programs, excluding scholarships and some loan programs, base eligibility on financial need. Financial need is defined as the difference between the Cost of Attendance and the Expected Family Contribution. The Cost of Attendance  19 is comprised of actual tuition and fees, plus room and board, and an allowance for books and supplies, transportation,  and living expenses. Expected Family Contribution is determined by a standard need analysis formula called Federal Methodology. Factors such as taxable and non-taxable income, assets, and household information are all considered in  this formula. Financial aid is awarded annually for one academic year. Continuation of an award requires an annual review of the applicant’s financial need, based on that year’s need analysis formula and academic progress, which is reviewed  each semester.   SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES  Individual circumstances that could affect the Expected Family Contribution include unemployment, change in job status,  or unusual medical expenses. When these situations occur, they should be communicated to the Financial Aid Office via a Special Conditions Form, which is available at http://www.carlow.edu/Financial_Aid_Forms.aspx.  APPLICATION PROCESS  A high school graduate or college transfer student who has completed an application for admission to Carlow University and who will be matriculated (degree seeking) for at least six credits a semester (half-time status) may apply for financial aid by completing the Free Application for Federal Student at www.fafsa.gov. The FAFSA is for students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. First-time applicants who are Pennsylvania residents will be contacted by PHEAA, the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, to complete a State Grant Status Notice for state grant consideration. All new students who wish to be considered for financial assistance should file the FAFSA by March 15, which is Carlow’s priority deadline. Applications received after this date will be processed as funds are available. Non-Pennsylvania residents must complete the FAFSA and any additional application their home state may require for state grant consideration. The FAFSA filing deadline for the PA State Grant is May 1.   VERIFICATION  About one-third of all FAFSA filers are selected for verification, a process in which the Financial Aid Office must verify the information reported on the FAFSA. Students selected for verification must submit requested documentation according to the verification flag associated with the FAFSA results. The most common type of verification requires that the student (and parent, if dependent) submit the Verification Worksheet and copies of IRS Tax Return Transcripts. When possible, use the IRS Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA. Tax transcripts will not be requested from students and parents who successfully transferred income information from the IRS to the FAFSA using the IRS Data Retrieval Tool. The Financial Aid Office notifies students via Carlow email if documents are needed to complete verification. Students may also access information about missing documents from Web Advisor.  OUTSIDE SCHOLARSHIPS  Students are encouraged to investigate private sources of financial aid. It is the responsibility of the student to notify the Financial Aid Office of any scholarship or grant received through outside sources.  FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID  Pell Grant:   Pell Grant is a federal need-based grant awarded to undergraduates seeking their first bachelor’s degree. The lifetime limit on Pell is the equivalent of twelve full-time semesters. Pell received for enrollment at other institutions before enrolling at Carlow University is taken into account when determining remaining eligibility.  Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity (FSEOG):   A federal need-based grant for undergraduates seeking their first bachelor’s degree. Priority is given to students with Pell Grant eligibility who submit the FAFSA by the priority filing date.   Federal Perkins Loan:   Perkins is a low-interest loan awarded by the Financial Aid Office based on FAFSA results. Funding is limited. Currently at 5 percent interest, the loan is repaid starting nine months after the student graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time  status. Perkins is a federal loan program administered by Carlow University in accordance with guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education.  20 Federal Direct Loan Program:   The Federal Direct Loan program consists of the Federal Direct Student Loan and Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loan.   The Federal Direct Student Loan program is available to degree-seeking students who are enrolled at least half time, which is a minimum of six credits per semester for undergraduates. The Subsidized Loan is available to students who demonstrate financial need. During in-school and deferment periods, the interest is paid by the U.S. Department of Education. First-time borrowers must complete Entrance Counseling and the Master Promissory Note at www.studentloans.gov.  The Unsubsidized Loan is available to students without demonstrated financial need. The borrower is responsible for the interest that accrues during in-half time-time.  Annual maximum combined eligibility for the Federal Direct Student Loan for dependent students is $5,500 for freshmen, $6,500 for sophomores, and $7,500 for juniors and seniors.   Annual maximum combined eligibility for the Federal Direct Student Loan for independent students and dependent students whose parents were denied PLUS loan is $9,500 for freshmen, $10,500 for sophomores, and $12,500 for juniors and seniors.  The aggregate limit for a dependent undergraduate is $31,000, with not more than $23,000 in Subsidized Loan. The aggregate limit for an independent student and dependent student whose parent is denied PLUS loan is $57,500, with not more than $23,000 in Subsidized Loan.  Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loans:   Federal Direct Parent PLUS Loans are for parents with favorable credit histories who want to borrow money to help pay for the education expenses of their dependent children. The maximum a parent may borrow in an academic year is the difference between the student’s Cost of Attendance and financial aid. Generally, repayment begins 60 days after the final loan disbursement in an academic year. Interest begins to accumulate at the time the first disbursement is made. Dependent students whose parents are denied the PLUS Loan due to adverse credit are eligible to receive additional Unsubsidized Loans. Freshmen and sophomores are eligible for $4,000 and juniors and seniors $5,000.   To apply for the PLUS Loan, the parent borrower must complete a PLUS application at www.studentloan.gov. If approved based on credit, the parent must then complete the promissory note, also at www.studentloan.gov.  Federal Work Study (FWS):   This need-based financial aid program provides job opportunities for students to help pay their educational expenses. Students with FWS eligibility must apply for available positions on campus to utilize their work study award.  Students are paid monthly, at least at the current federal minimum wage, and are encouraged to put their earnings toward their  account balance.  Nursing Loan:   Funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this program is intended to help students achieve careers in nursing. Currently at 5 percent interest, this loan is awarded to nursing students enrolled at least half time who demonstrate financial need. The loan is repaid starting nine months after the student graduates, leaves school, drops below half time, or changes from nursing to another major.  STATE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS   Pennsylvania State Grant:   The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) offers need-based grants to undergraduates seeking their first bachelor’s degree who are Pennsylvania residents and enrolled at least half time. Eligibility is limited to eight full-time semesters. Students whose enrollment is limited to one eight-week CAP session in a semester are not eligible for Pennsylvania state grant in that semester. For more information about the Pennsylvania State Grant program and other grant and scholarship programs administered by PHEAA, please visit www.pheaa.org or call 1.800.692.7392. The FAFSA deadline for PA State Grant is May 1.     21 Other State Grant Programs:   Students who are not Pennsylvania residents should contact the agency in their home state to see if they are eligible for assistance while attending a school in Pennsylvania.  AWARD LETTERS  Students who apply for financial aid will receive an official award letter that shows financial aid for the entire academic year, fall and spring. New students will receive paper award letters through regular mail. Returning students will be notified via Carlow email when their award letter is available on WebAdvisor. All students must officially accept their financial aid by completing a Reply Form either on paper or online.   INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID  Carlow offers merit and athletic scholarships, which are not based on financial need and are awarded to eligible traditional undergraduate students as defined by the Office of Admission (unless otherwise noted) enrolled in degree-seeking programs. Carlow also offers institutional need-based grants.   PRIVATE ALTERNATIVE LOANS  There are many private loans that may be used for educational expenses. A list of loans used most frequently by Carlow students can be found at www.elmstreet.com, but students are free to use any lender they choose. Interest rates and terms of the loans vary by lender and the borrower’s credit history.   RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS   The Financial Aid Office recalculates federal* financial aid eligibility for students who withdraw, drop out, are dismissed, or take a leave of absence prior to completing at least 60 percent of a semester. Federal financial aid is returned to the federal government based on the percent of unearned aid using the following formula:   Step One:    Percent earned = Number of days completed up to the withdrawal date** / total days in the semester  Step Two:   Aid to be returned = (100 percent–percent earned in Step 1) x the amount of federal aid disbursed or to be disbursed toward institutional charges   *Federal financial aid includes the Federal Pell Grant, SEOG Grant, Perkins Loan, Federal Stafford Loan, and PLUS Loan.  **Withdrawal date is defined as the actual date the student contacted the registrar to begin the institution’s withdrawal process, the student’s last date of recorded attendance, or the midpoint of the semester for a student who leaves without notifying the institution.  The school must return unearned aid by repaying funds to the following sources in the following order:   • Unsubsidized Federal Direct Loan  • Subsidized Federal Direct Loan  • Perkins Loan  • Federal Direct Parent Plus Loan  • Pell Grant  • FSEOG  • Other Title IV programs   When aid is returned, the student may owe a balance to the university. If so, the student should contact the Office of Student Accounts to make arrangements to pay the balance due.    22 The Federal Refund Calculations only apply if the student is withdrawing from all classes. However, if a student makes changes in registration that result in changes to tuition and fee amounts, the Financial Aid Office will recalculate the Cost of Attendance and may need to change the original amount of aid awarded.   IMPORTANT: BEFORE WITHDRAWING FROM ALL OR SOME CLASSES, STUDENTS SHOULD CONTACT FINANCIAL AID/STUDENT ACCOUNTS TO FIND OUT THE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS. STUDENTS COVERED BY FINANCIAL AID MAY FIND THEMSELVES WITH AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE BECAUSE FUNDS HAD TO BE RETURNED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR FINANCIAL AID  The United States Department of Education requires that institutions of higher education set standards to measure satisfactory academic progress for students who are receiving Title IV (Federal) financial aid. Carlow uses the same standards to measure academic progress for institutional, need-based grants. The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency (PHEAA) has its own academic progress policy for Pennsylvania state grant recipients.   Satisfactory Progress:   Satisfactory progress is defined as a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 and enough cumulative credits earned to equal at least 67 percent of cumulative credits attempted.   Students must be able to complete their program of study within 150 percent of the credits required, so for a 120-credit bachelor’s degree program, a first-time student must be able to earn the degree within 180 credits attempted in order to remain eligible for Title IV aid.  PROCEDURE  The Financial Aid Office reviews academic progress after each semester. Transcripts from the Office of the Registrar are reviewed. The review includes an examination of the student’s cumulative GPA, the ratio of credits earned versus credits attempted, and the amount of time taken to complete the program of study.  Warning:   If a student’s cumulative GPA has fallen below 2.0, or the student has earned less than 67 percent of his or her cumulative credits attempted, or both, the student will be placed on financial aid warning for the following semester. Students are notified in writing from the Financial Aid Office of their warning status. During this warning period, students must work to raise their cumulative GPA to at least a 2.0 and their cumulative credits earned to at least 67 percent of cumulative credits attempted. Students are strongly encouraged to utilize the tutoring opportunities in the university’s Center for Academic Achievement, particularly during warning periods. Students may continue to receive financial aid during warning periods as long as all other eligibility criteria are met.   Suspension:   At the end of the warning period, the Financial Aid Office will review the student’s academic transcript. If the student has not met the minimum criteria for GPA and credits earned, eligibility for federal and institutional financial aid will be suspended. Students are notified in writing from the Financial Aid Office of their suspension status. The letter will include information about how to appeal due to extenuating circumstances. A student’s financial aid will not be suspended without a period of warning. Students whose financial aid eligibility is suspended may regain eligibility once they meet the requirements for satisfactory academic progress.   Appeal Process:   If the student’s financial aid eligibility is suspended, the student may appeal for one additional semester of eligibility, as long as there are extenuating circumstances and an academic plan has been established with the student’s advisor. Extenuating circumstances may be directly related to the student’s academic experience or to circumstances of a more personal nature, such as injury, illness, or trauma. All appeals are reviewed by the Academic Progress Committee. When an appeal is approved, the student will be placed on financial aid probation for the next period of enrollment and will be eligible for financial aid, as long as all other eligibility criteria are met.   23 The Academic Progress Appeal Form for Financial Aid is located on myPortal under Student HUB and Financial Aid. Upon completion, the form should be faxed, mailed, or emailed to the Financial Aid Office to the attention of the Director of Financial Aid. All decisions rendered by the committee are final.  Scholarship renewal is contingent on GPA. Appeals are not considered for students who lose scholarship eligibility because their GPA is below required minimum.   Transfer Students:   Credit hours accepted at Carlow are counted as both attempted and completed hours.  Withdrawals:   A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a particular course prior to the final date to withdraw in a given semester, according to the academic calendar published in the Carlow Course Schedule and online at www.carlow.edu/registrar/registrar.html. A WD on a transcript influences the ratio of cumulative credits earned versus credits attempted. Withdrawals also impact the amount of time taken to complete the program of study.   Repeated Courses:   A student wishing to retake a course in which they received a D or F grade can do so only by repeating the same course  at Carlow University. Both grades for a repeated course are recorded on the transcript. The higher grade is used in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. A student who repeats a course one time may still be considered for financial aid for  that course. A student who repeats a course for which credits were earned will not earn additional credits for the  repeated course.   Academic Forgiveness:   When a student is granted Academic Forgiveness by the provost, the actual earned credits and earned grade are the units taken into account for the purpose of measuring academic progress for financial aid.  Pennsylvania State Grants:   For each academic year during which a Pennsylvania state grant is received, a student must successfully complete the minimum number of credits appropriate to the student’s enrollment status during the semester(s) for which state grant aid was received. In an academic year, students receiving two full-time semesters of state grant aid must earn at least 24 credits, and students receiving two part-time semesters of state grant aid must earn at least 12 credits. A student who has not maintained satisfactory academic progress for state grant aid may enroll in summer courses (without state grant aid) to make up the necessary credits.   Academic Levels:   The following guidelines are used to determine the academic level for undergraduate students:   • Freshman—a student who has completed 0 to 23 credits  • Sophomore—a student who has completed 24 to 53 credits  • Junior—a student who has completed 54 to 87 credits  • Senior—a student who has completed at least 88 credits  ACADEMIC INFORMATION  ACADEMIC ADVISING  All students are assigned an academic advisor when they are registered for classes in a program. Students are expected to meet with their advisor prior to and throughout their program of study. The academic advisor is responsible for helping the student make informed choices about course selection, but it is the student’s responsibility to ensure that courses are appropriately selected to meet all requirements of the program and university in order to satisfy graduation requirements.   24 Students are matched to academic advisors by the department chair/program director. If a change is necessary, the program director/chair will assign a different academic advisor in consultation with the student and faculty.  ORIENTATION   The orientation program is the first step to a successful Carlow experience. Students will learn valuable information about their academic programs and support services, IDs, parking, and technology at Carlow; they will also have the opportunity to meet and socialize with one another and with the members of the faculty, staff, and administration. For more information about orientation, students should visit the Carlow website.   ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES  HONOR AND SERVICE SOCIETIES   Outstanding achievement in the general academic program entitles students to apply for membership in national honor societies. Benefits vary by the society but, in general, membership in a national honor society can also provide access to educational enrichment activities, career planning, and career advancement opportunities.   Chapters of honor and service societies on the Carlow University campus are:   Alpha Nu Theta:  Alpha Nu Theta is Carlow University’s Chapter of Sigma Tau Delta, an International English Honor Society. The Society strives to confer distinction for high achievement in English language and literature in undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies; provide, through its local chapters, cultural stimulation on college campuses, and promote interest in literature and the English language in surrounding communities; foster all aspects of the discipline of English, including literature, language, and writing; promote exemplary character and good fellowship among its members; exhibit high standards of academic excellence; and serve society by fostering literacy.  Alpha Sigma Lambda:   A scholastic and fraternal organization, Alpha Sigma Lambda is a national honor society for nontraditional adult students. Its goal is to recognize the special achievements of adults who accomplish academic excellence while facing competing interests of home and work. Alpha Sigma Lambda is dedicated to the advancement of scholarship and recognizes scholastic achievement in an adult student’s career. Inductees must have a GPA of 3.5 in order to be invited for membership. Through programming and camaraderie, the society encourages its members to continue toward and to earn their degrees.   Beta Beta Beta:   This national professional society for students of the biological sciences offers experiences that enrich and extend the primary requirements for the biology major.

Students are eligible for graduation with honors under the following conditions:   Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of:   • to 4.0—summa cum laude  • to 3.89—magna cum laude  • 3.50 to 3.69—cum laude   Latin Honors are calculated based upon grades at the conclusion of CAP III for May commencement. Students who have received academic forgiveness may be eligible to graduate with honors limited to the cum laude designation only.   Joseph G. Smith Memorial Award:   In honor of the late Joseph G. Smith, former chairman of the Board of Trustees, this highest Carlow award is given to a senior in recognition of academic distinction and service to the university and to the community.   The Honors Program invites accomplished and motivated students to participate in a series of academic experiences that will challenge their abilities and help them to prepare for professions or graduate study. Through this program, students experience expanded leadership opportunities, and increased opportunities to interact with faculty and to shape their own education experience. See Honors Program on page 57.   STUDY ABROAD  We encourage Carlow students to enhance their on-campus and online coursework with a study abroad experience. Study abroad allows students to travel outside the United States to earn credits toward their Carlow degree requirements (major, minor, and Compass) through coursework, academic internships, and service-learning. Opportunities of varying lengths are available year-round for students of all majors and foreign language proficiency levels (including English-only programs), and funding is available to help make the experience affordable for students from a range of financial backgrounds.  There are three types of study abroad opportunities: 1. Carlow-created programs: Designed for Carlow students and often taught by Carlow faculty, these programs typically offer focused coursework and experiential learning opportunities outside the classroom. Fees vary by program, and students may be able to use their regular financial aid, including Carlow scholarships, to help fund the experience. Current programs include spring break in Nicaragua, full-semester options in Italy and Ireland, and short-term summer options in Ireland. 2. ISEP exchange program: Students may spend one or two semesters at any one of 250 universities around the world as part of the ISEP program. As an exchange program, students pay their regular Carlow tuition, room, and board to Carlow and pay nothing to their host university abroad. In addition, students may be able to use their regular financial aid, including Carlow sch 3. olarships, to help fund the experience. Extensive English-language coursework in a wide variety of disciplines is available across the ISEP network. 4. Third-party programs: Students may also select credit-bearing programs offered by other universities and study abroad companies. Although students cannot use Carlow scholarships on these programs, they may still be able to use federal financial aid. Programs of varying lengths, disciplines, and prices are available around the world.  26 Students who are interested in studying abroad should begin the planning process as early as possible with the Center for Global Learning, which provides support with program selection, financial planning, credit transfer, health and safety orientation, and more. Center for Global Learning University Commons, Third Floor www.carlow.edu/studyabroad 412.578.6378 global@carlow.edu   INTERNSHIPS AND FIELD PLACEMENT   Off-campus fieldwork is a regular part of the curriculum. Students in nursing, education, perfusion, communication, accounting, forensic accounting, business management, human resource management, health management, psychology, criminology, political science, and social work are required to do discipline-specific professional work experiences as an integral part of their program. Other departments and interdisciplinary programs also offer internship experience.  ACADEMIC RESOURCES  OFFICE OF CAREER DEVELOPMENT   This Office provides students with the training and coaching they need to obtain their job (or graduate school placement of choice) at graduation. Services include one-on-one appointments, workshops, career programs, skills training, classroom presentations, on-campus employer interviews, job fairs, and online resources.  All these services are available to current students and alumni within two years after graduation.  The Office of Career Development utilizes a web-based system for job and internship postings, and notifications of career and networking events both on and off campus. Four highly trained Peer Career Advisors join the Career Development staff to provide personalized coaching for job or internship searches, resume and cover letter writing, mock interviews, assistance with e-portfolios, training in salary negotiations, and career advising on careers and academic majors.  CENTER FOR ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT  The Carlow University Center for Academic Achievement (CAA) provides tutoring and academic support to Carlow students. Professionals and peer tutors in math, science, writing, and learning skills work in collaboration with students in both individual and group settings. Faculty-approved and CRLA-trained and certified peer tutors, who are expert students, provide assistance and support classroom learning for a wide range of courses. Students may sign up for one-time or ongoing tutoring sessions; informal, as-needed review sessions; and study groups. In these settings, students review course material, practice problem solving, prepare for examinations, and develop general academic skills necessary for success and self-directed, lifelong learning.  The CAA also provides Academic Coaching services. Academic coaches work with students through purposeful mentoring in academic and organization skills to promote self-efficacy and resiliency. Coaches provide guidance regarding time management, learning and study strategies, and test-taking skills in order to help students create and be accountable for achieving academic goals.  ONLINE RESOURCES  Please visit the CelticOnline group site, “CAA Resources,” for links to resources and tip sheets. Instructional PowerPoint presentations include topics like “Becoming a Skilled Researcher,” “Formatting Your Paper APA Style,” “APA Essentials,” and “College Survival Skills.”   GRACE LIBRARY  Grace Library supports collections and services to foster academic excellence and promote the process of self-directed, lifelong learning.

TRANSCRIPT REQUESTS   All requests for official transcripts should be submitted in writing to the Office of the Registrar. A student’s signature is required to release any transcript. A fee is charged for each transcript. A transcript will not be issued unless all financial obligations owed to the university have been fulfilled. Current students may view their own academic records online at https://webadvisor.carlow.edu.  28 RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS (ROTC)  Air Force and Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs are offered through cross-registration at the University of Pittsburgh. Students in the Army and Air Force programs have the option of completing a two- or a four-year program. Completion of the Air Force program leads to a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force. Completion of the Army ROTC program leads to a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Army National Guard, or the U.S. Army Reserve.   Carlow students can enroll in the Navy ROTC through Carnegie Mellon University. Completion of the Navy ROTC program leads to a commission as an officer in the U.S. Navy or U.S. Marine Corps.   Interested students can enroll through Carlow’s Office of the Registrar or find out more information at the following websites:   • Army: www.rotc.pitt.edu  • Air Force: www.afrotc.pitt.edu  • Navy: www.cmu.edu/nrotc  STUDENT EVALUATION  The methods that faculty use to evaluate student achievement vary according to the types of learning experiences. Written examinations are a common means of evaluation, but research papers, essays, interviews, classroom interaction, media presentations, observation, and clinical and field experience are also used.  ACADEMIC POLICIES  In addition to the following academic policies, students are advised to consult with their program directors/chairs regarding major-specific policies and/or handouts.  ACADEMIC CALENDAR   The academic calendar is published annually. Carlow follows the semester system, although some programs are divided into shorter sessions within the semester. (See Accelerated Course Calendar in the section below.) Most academic-related actions are carried out on a semester basis, such as academic standing decisions, the Dean’s List, and determination for graduation.   ACCELERATED COURSE CALENDAR  Carlow Accelerated Program (CAP) classes generally meet for eight weeks. These courses typically meet in the evening or online and can occur in CAP I through VI sections. In addition to CAP sections, some courses meet over the weekend.   When an accelerated course is scheduled to meet at a time the university is closed, faculty will schedule a make-up class, provide an out-of-class assignment or hold an online session. Classes will not be conducted on days when the institution is officially closed. As alternatives to a make-up day, faculty may decide to give the class a substantive assignment or hold an online class session instead of using the make-up day. Faculty who teach an accelerated-format class that should meet on an official holiday will publish in their syllabus which of these plans will be in place for that course.   ACADEMIC FORGIVENESS  Any student who matriculated at Carlow University and withdrew at least five years prior to seeking re-admission* has the option of requesting academic forgiveness through the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs. A student seeking academic forgiveness shall request consideration at the time of re-admission. Academic forgiveness means all previous courses the student has passed will remain on the permanent record, but none will be computed into the new cumulative GPA. Credit earned prior to academic forgiveness for courses graded A, B, C, or D will be counted toward degree requirements. Previous courses graded F will not be counted toward degree requirements. Please refer to individual departments for specific repeat policies in major and support courses.   29 When a student is granted academic forgiveness by the Provost, the actual earned credits and earned grades are the units taken into account for the purpose of measuring academic progress for financial aid. To complete the degree, the student must earn a minimum of 32 credits after academic forgiveness. To earn graduation honors, the student must earn a minimum 3.5 GPA. Honors are limited to the cum laude designation, no matter how high the GPA.  *For additional information regarding re-admission please refer to page 45—Re-Admission Procedure to the University.  ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY   Carlow University’s values and vision are founded in the Sisters of Mercy’s mission of cultivating lifelong learners through a learner-centric approach. It is in this tradition that Carlow University aims to educate and challenge students to reach their highest potential; to that end, we guide students along a path of honesty and integrity throughout their intellectual pursuits. Carlow University expects its constituencies to understand the various forms of academic dishonesty and to uphold the highest standards of academic integrity.  FORMS OF ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT  Cheating  Any coursework, such as (but not limited to) quizzes, tests, exams (in-class, online, or take-home), homework or other assignments, lab work, presentations, and both creative and scholarly forms of expression such as projects and papers, computer programs, artistic, musical, or any audiovisual or multimedia work, is presumed to represent a student’s individual, original work (or the original work of all members of a group, in the case of group assignments). Cheating thus involves completing coursework by providing or receiving inappropriate assistance from a person or reference, or using unauthorized material such as (but not limited to) notes of any form, texts, test banks, wireless devices such as cell phones, tablets, or smart watches, calculators, formulas, or computers, unless otherwise directed or permitted by the course instructor.   Plagiarism  Plagiarism refers to the unauthorized use of copyrighted material or misrepresentation of someone else’s work as one’s own in any coursework, such as (but not limited to) quizzes, tests, exams (in-class, online, or take-home), homework or other assignments, lab work, presentations, and both creative and scholarly forms of expression such as projects and papers, computer programs, artistic, musical, or any audiovisual or multimedia work.  Plagiarism can occur in many ways, including:  1. Submitting another’s work as one’s own. 2. Not properly citing sources, using exact wording without quotations or proper attribution, paraphrasing without proper citation, or improper paraphrasing. 3. Attributing citations to inaccurate or misleading sources. Self-Plagiarism  Unless otherwise permitted by the course instructor or the nature of the assignment, each submitted work is presumed to be original. Self-plagiarism thus involves the unauthorized use of one’s own work or part of a work, either from the same course or from another course, in more than one assignment.  Academic Deceit  Academic deceit involves the intentional use of false or altered information or the withholding of information critical to the processes of the University such as grade changes, course withdrawals, or other academic procedures. Academic deceit also entails providing false information or documentation with the intent to obtain an exemption, extension or exception to assignments, exams, presentations, and other coursework. In addition, academic deceit involves signing other students into classes or on group reports.  Fabrication of Data  Fabrication of data involves the use of distorted data through either falsification or fabrication, or any sort of forgery or unsanctioned use of documents for research or other coursework.    30 Interference with Other Students’ Learning or Achievement  The interference with the classroom learning or scholarly products of other students is a violation of academic integrity. Examples include, but are not limited to: sabotaging (including failing to contribute to) group projects or laboratory work, disrupting in-class work including tests and quizzes, altering computer files or online posts, or making educational materials such as equipment or texts unavailable to others.   Unauthorized Acquisition or Exchange of Coursework  Unauthorized acquisition or exchange of coursework involves not only purchasing, borrowing, stealing, or otherwise obtaining material (such as, but not limited to, exams, test bank questions, papers, projects, assignments, and presentations) with the intent to use or represent part or all of the material as one’s own coursework, but also selling, lending, or otherwise offering one’s own coursework to others with the intent of allowing the recipient to use or represent part or all of the purchased or borrowed work as one’s own. In addition, unauthorized acquisition or exchange of coursework entails obtaining a copy of one’s own completed tests and exams (either a physical copy, an electronic image, or a screenshot) without explicit permission from the course instructor.  Copyright Violations  According to the copyright law, the creator of an original work has the exclusive right to use or distribute said work. Unauthorized redistribution of copyrighted material, including any educational or training material provided by the instructor or the University or obtained from the textbook, constitutes a violation of the copyright law.  Other Forms of Academic Misconduct  Carlow University reserves the right to act upon other actions that a reasonable person would consider academic dishonesty that may not be listed specifically above.  POLICY ON SHARING OF COURSE MATERIAL  The copyright law states that the creator of an original work has the exclusive right to use or distribute said work. All course material, including but not limited to presentation slides, lecture notes, handouts, audio or video recordings, syllabi, assignments, problem sets, quizzes, tests, and exams, are the property of the instructor who developed them, the University that commissioned the work, or the publisher of the original content (such as textbook publishers). Students may use this material for their own learning and for discussion with other students in the class.  The following are not permissible uses of course material and constitute violations of Carlow University’s academic  integrity policy:  • Unauthorized redistribution of the material, such as uploading it online for others to access. • Posting of any material for the purpose of helping other students gain an unfair advantage in a course. • Unauthorized access of material posted by others for the purpose of gaining an unfair advantage in a course.  Original course notes and papers written by students are their own intellectual property. However, students should be aware that sharing such material may result in misuse by other students, such as plagiarism.  VIOLATIONS OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  When academic misconduct is suspected, the faculty should contact the Office of Academic Affairs to inquire about previous academic integrity violations by the student.  If the alleged misconduct is the student’s first offense of a similar nature, and the faculty believes the misconduct is minor or the result of an honest mistake, the faculty should contact the student within five business days of discovering the violation to arrange a meeting (the meeting may be in person or online or via electronic communication) and attempt to resolve the matter with the student directly. The faculty member may impose a sanction at his/her discretion. Also, in the spirit of helping guide the student’s learning process, the faculty should refer the student to such resources as the Center for Academic Achievement, as appropriate. Once a resolution is achieved, the faculty and the student must sign an agreement detailing the misconduct and the sanction imposed to be kept on record at the Office of Academic Affairs. This agreement only kept as a means of tracking and is not meant to become part of a student’s permanent academic record. The student may not contest the sanction or appeal to a higher level.  31 If the faculty and the student are unable to reach a resolution, or if the student denies responsibility for the alleged academic integrity violation, the matter is forwarded to the Academic Integrity Committee for a judicial hearing, as described below.  If the alleged misconduct is not the student’s first offense of a similar nature, or if the faculty believes the misconduct is serious, blatant, or warrants consideration by a higher authority, the matter is forwarded to the Academic Integrity Committee for a judicial hearing, as described below. The Committee may collaborate with the faculty to impose further sanctions following the hearing.  Judicial Hearing Procedure  The faculty will contact the Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee at least 72 hours prior to the next regular meeting of the Committee in the fall or spring semesters to begin the judicial hearing process. The Chair will then notify Dean of the College that houses the accused student’s major(s), the Office of the Registrar, and the Office of Academic Affairs of the pending case.  The Academic Integrity Committee shall convene a Judicial Hearing Panel for the case at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The faculty and the student are both expected to appear at the hearing and present their evidence in front of all parties in attendance. If the faculty and/or the student is unable to attend the hearing in person, they may present their case in a written statement to be provided to the Chair of the Judicial Hearing Panel prior to the hearing. Barring any extenuating circumstance, the faculty is expected to attend the meeting or provide a written statement of evidence; otherwise, the case is dismissed. The faculty should also provide the Panel with written documentation of the alleged misconduct, if possible, in digital form prior to the hearing. If the student does not attend the meeting and fails to provide a written statement of his/her case, the hearing will continue with the evidence available.  Only members of the Judicial Hearing Panel, the faculty alleging the misconduct, the accused student, and witnesses (if applicable) may attend the hearing; no other personnel shall be permitted. If a witness cannot attend the hearing, he/she may be asked to submit a written statement as evidence. The faculty, student, and witnesses may be excused from the room during the Panel’s deliberation.   During the judicial hearing process, the student may not withdraw from the course. If the matter is not resolved by the final grade due date, an incomplete grade is assigned until the Judicial Hearing Panel rules on the matter. The student will not be conferred a degree or certificate if there are outstanding academic misconduct charges.   If the Judicial Hearing Panel finds the student guilty of violating the academic integrity policy, the Panel will have three business days to consult with the faculty alleging misconduct for a decision on appropriate sanctions. In collaboration with the faculty, the following grade sanctions may be applied:  • Zero credit on the assignment • Failure of the course For serious cases of academic misconduct, the Panel may consult with the program(s)/department(s) that houses the student’s major area(s) of study and recommend that the Provost apply the following sanctions:  • Suspension from the University • Dismissal from the University  In the case of suspension from the University, if the ruling occurs past the course withdrawal date, the suspension will begin at the end of the current semester so that the student will not incur financial aid penalties. If a student is dismissed from the University due to violation of the academic integrity policy, he/she cannot be readmitted to the University in the future.  The Panel’s ruling may be appealed, following the procedure described below.  The Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee will notify the student, the faculty alleging the misconduct, the Dean of the College that houses the student’s major(s), and the Office of the Registrar regarding the outcome of the Panel’s ruling.  All records of academic integrity violations will be kept permanently in the Office of Academic Affairs.  Cases of academic integrity violation that take place after the last spring hearing of the academic year or over the summer months shall be directed to the Office of Academic Affairs, which will convene an ad hoc panel consisting of three faculty  32 who are available to serve within ten business days from the time the academic integrity violation is reported. The Office of Academic Affairs will also notify the Dean of the College that houses the student’s major(s) and the Office of the Registrar regarding pending cases and the outcome of the ad hoc panel’s ruling.  Composition of the Academic Integrity Committee  The Academic Integrity Committee is a standing committee that is available to meet once per month during the fall and spring semesters. This committee shall consist of two faculty members from each college (six total), serving staggering two-year terms. The Academic Integrity Committee shall work with the Office of Student Affairs to identify eligible graduate and undergraduate students to serve on Judicial Hearing Panels.  Judicial Hearing Panels shall be convened as needed to take place during the Committee’s scheduled meeting time. Each Panel shall consist of four members, as follows:  • Three faculty members from the Committee (one from each College). • One student. An undergraduate student will serve if the accused is an undergraduate student, while a graduate student will serve if the accused is a graduate student. Student members must not have previous violations of the Academic Integrity Policy. In addition, one staff member may serve as a consultant if such expertise is deemed necessary.  If a Panel member fails to attend the hearing, the hearing will proceed with the remaining members of the Panel, providing that there are at least three Panel members present.  Members serving on a Judicial Hearing Panel must not have taught the accused student in the past or have personal ties to the student. If no Committee member from a particular College is eligible to serve under this condition, the Chair of the Academic Integrity Committee will work with the College representative to identify a substitute from that College.  Appeals  Following the Judicial Hearing Panel’s ruling, both the faculty alleging misconduct and the accused student may appeal the decision in writing detailing the grounds of the appeal. Appeals must be submitted to the Provost within ten business days of the Panel’s ruling. The decision of the Provost is final and a written record of the decision shall be kept on file. Should the Provost reverse the ruling of the Panel, he/she shall explain the rationale for the reversal, in writing, to the Panel.  STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT   Students of Carlow University are expected to conduct themselves as responsible individuals who respect the rights and dignity of others. University rules and regulations are intended to protect the rights of each member of the university community. Students are expected to act reasonably, responsibly, and with civility while on campus and at university-sponsored events off campus. See the Carlow University Student Handbook for more information.   ACADEMIC GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE   Formal grievance procedures have been established to provide students with a means to express concerns regarding the application of academic policies, procedures, practices, rules, or regulations of the university, and a method by which concerns can be resolved. For appeal of a grade, students should consult the Grade Changes and Grade Appeals section. The student is encouraged initially to discuss the concern informally with the faculty member and/or department/program chair. Students must utilize internal mechanisms for grievances before involving external counsel. General counsel is not part of the internal grievance procedure.  Steps to address a concern:  1. If a student has an academic concern she/he should present the situation to the faculty member in writing/email. The email must make explicit that the student is starting the grievance procedure. The faculty member will arrange an appointment as soon as possible. The faculty member will respond to the concern presented during this initial appointment within seven days of the appointment. Parties should retain a written record of this discussion. Most matters can be settled by frank discussion of the facts. 2. Should the concern remain unresolved, the student will discuss the matter with the department chair or program director and determine if a resolution can be mutually agreed or if a grievance process is required. This will be  33 completed within five days of response from Step 1. In order for all facts to be carefully re-examined and evaluated, the department chair will follow these procedures: a. Discuss the situation with the faculty member(s) b. Arrange to meet with the student and involved faculty together to arrive at resolutions to the situation c. Retain written notes from each intervention 3. Should the concern remain unresolved with the department chair or program director, or if the specific concern involves the department chair, the student will take the concern to the appropriate dean. The student filing the grievance must have completed Step 1 and have documentation of the discussion. The appropriate dean will then follow Steps 2a and b. There should be a written record of each meeting and its outcome. 4. If the grievance remains unresolved at this level and the student wishes to pursue it further, the dean will begin the process of setting up the grievance committee as described in this step. The committee will consist of five members: two students and three faculty members. One faculty member will be elected as chair of the committee and will vote only to break a tie. Student members will be drawn from the pool of graduate students when a grievance is filed by a graduate student. Faculty members will be drawn from other graduate departments. The student and faculty members may each request the removal of any one member of the pool of eligible members. 5. Both parties will be informed of the status or resolution of the grievance at each step of the process. If either party remains unsatisfied with the decision of the committee, the dean will notify the provost that there is dissatisfaction with the decision. The provost shall make a final determination.  ACADEMIC STANDING  Carlow University requires that students maintain satisfactory academic progress while attending the institution. In order to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a student must have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 and earn at least 67% of cumulative credits attempted.  PROCEDURE  The Academic Standing Committee reviews academic progress after each semester. Transcripts from the Office of the Registrar are reviewed. The review includes an examination of the student’s cumulative GPA and the percentage of credits earned versus credits attempted.   Warning:   If a student’s cumulative GPA has fallen below 2.0, or the student has earned less than 67 percent of his or her cumulative credits attempted, or both, the student will be placed on academic warning for the following semester. Students are notified in writing of their warning status. During this warning period, students must work to raise their cumulative GPA to at least a 2.0 and their cumulative credits earned to at least 67 percent of cumulative credits attempted.  Dismissal:   At the end of the warning period, the student’s academic transcript is reviewed. If the student has not met the minimum criteria for GPA and credits earned, the student is dismissed from Carlow University for one year. For first-time, first-year students, those earning a GPA below 1.0 in their first semester may be moved directly to dismissal. Students are notified in writing of their dismissal status. A student may appeal his or her dismissal.        ACADEMIC STANDING APPEAL PROCESS  If a student has been dismissed from the university, the student may appeal to return for one additional semester. If the minimum criteria for GPA and credits earned is not mathematically possible to achieve in one semester, the student may be given permission to continue to take classes so long as an academic plan for improvement is in place and the student meets all guidelines. All appeals are reviewed by the Academic Progress Committee. If the appeal is approved, the student will be placed on academic probation and will be permitted to take classes. If the appeal is denied, the student’s dismissal stands, and s/he is dismissed from the university for one year.  RE-ADMISSION AFTER A DISMISSAL  If a student is dismissed from the university, the student may apply for re-admission after one year, including the summer terms. For example, if a student is dismissed in the fall semester, s/he must sit out the spring, summer, and following fall semesters and can return, if accepted, for the following spring semester. The student must reapply to Carlow University through the Admissions Office and select “Re-admit” on the admissions application. Admissions must notify the   34 appropriate dean of their intent to re-apply. It should be noted that a student who has been dismissed from the BSN program is not eligible for re-admission to the BSN program. In addition to the application, the procedure for consideration for re-admission will include, but will not be limited to: a personal statement from the student that addresses the issues that lead to the original dismissal and how the obstacles to the student’s academic progression have been remedied, and an updated resume. The required statement and resume should be submitted with the re-application. If a dismissed student is re-admitted to the university, s/he will re-enter on academic probation.  Due to changing admission and curriculum requirements, the university reserves the right to re-evaluate all academic courses, whether completed at Carlow or elsewhere, to determine what will be credited toward the student’s degree and to determine a new plan of study. A student who is dismissed twice is not eligible for re-admission.  LEARNING ASSESSMENT AT CARLOW  A Carlow degree represents a commitment to our students—a commitment that they will be given the opportunity to learn and be able to demonstrate the skills, knowledge and competencies that are necessary to enter into a career, a community of practice, or higher levels of graduate study.  One of the ways we honor this commitment is through the practice of learning assessment.  By engaging in learning assessment processes, we take steps to ensure our students achieve the learning goals represented by their degree.   Through our learning assessment efforts, we seek to provide truthful and accurate answers to the following questions:  • What goals do we have for students with respect to the knowledge, competencies, and skills they should develop or master to be able to enter into a career, a community of practice, or higher levels of graduate study? • What intentional steps do we take to achieve these goals? • How successful are our students in achieving these goals? That is, what are the actual outcomes? • How do we improve student learning when the information obtained through our efforts indicates that students’ progress in achieving these goals is not sufficient?  In Standards for Accreditation and Requirements of Affiliation (2016), the Middle States Commission on Higher Education observes that assessment has the student as its primary focus, functions to help students improve their learning, enhances quality, and leads to continuous improvements in academic programs.  As a member of the Middle States Association, Carlow University embraces these principles as integral to its own framework for assessment. In fact, the improvement of teaching and learning is the framework’s primary goal.   Carlow’s Learning Assessment Framework  Based on best practices in the field of learning assessment, we have established a common set of expectations for the development and assessment of student learning outcomes. Each program of study is responsible for maintaining a sustainable assessment process. Specifically, a sustainable assessment plan in Carlow’s learning assessment framework includes the following elements:  1. Clearly Articulated Student Learning Outcomes To ensure learning, a program must first define goals in order to intentionally work toward those goals. With this in mind, each program of study defines five to seven program-level student learning outcomes. These outcomes are statements about what a learner should be able to do after he/she has completed the program of study. At the end of each academic year, departments and programs of study review their outcome results and use the information to determine action steps that will improve, bolster and better assure student learning.  2. Defined Measures and Criteria for Success Learning outcome statements specify student learning behaviors that are observable, measurable and able to be demonstrated. Based on all of this, each program of study identifies opportunities where students apply and demonstrate their learning outcomes. These can include exams, papers, presentations, projects, and other assignments. After identifying these demonstration opportunities, programs of study establish standards of quality, i.e., “criteria for success”, that they will use to evaluate the learning outcomes, ensuring that they meet our expectations and prepare students for future success. Wherever necessary, rubrics are developed to clearly explain the criteria used to evaluate outcomes.     35 3. Collection and Analysis of Data Upon conducting assessments of each learning outcome, programs of study and Compass curriculum areas collect and analyze the resulting data.  This analysis includes evaluation of the achievement of each outcome and thus leads to identification of best practices or areas in which student learning can be improved. 4. Action Plans for the Improvement of Student Learning Where data collected indicate unsatisfactory progress in the achievement of learning outcomes, faculty will identify tangible actions that will be taken to improve student learning. The efficacy of these actions is then evaluated through future assessments.  It should be noted that while this framework provides clear guidelines for how each program of study carries out assessment, it leaves great flexibility to faculty, departments, and programs in determining and implementing the best practices for evaluating their students’ achievement. There are several programs at Carlow University that are externally accredited, including programs in the School of Nursing (CCNE), the Counseling Psychology Doctoral Program (APA), the Respiratory Care Program (provisional accreditation through the Council on Accreditation for Respiratory Care-COARC), and the Social Work program (CSWE). For these programs, external agencies often have their own requirements regarding assessment and these programs may adapt the Carlow framework to conduct assessment of student learning in ways that align with those requirements.  Assessment Reports and Activities  Each program produces an assessment report each year that includes the following:  • Assessment results data from the most recent academic year. • Plans for the improvement of student learning that result from analysis of the data collected.  Additionally, general education and institutional learning outcomes (a.k.a “Compass learning outcomes”) are reviewed by the Carlow Compass Curriculum Steering Committee. In these reviews, which are designed to carefully examine the quality of education achieved by our Carlow Compass Curriculum, information and data on assessment of student learning are carefully evaluated by representative faculty from across the university.  CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS   Each program produces an assessment report each year that includes the following:  • First-year: Students who have completed 0 to 23 credits  • Sophomores: Students who have completed at least 24 credits  • Juniors: Students who have completed at least 54 credits  • Seniors: Students who have completed at least 88 credits  • Full-time Students: Undergraduate students enrolled for 12 or more credits  • Part-time Students: Undergraduate students enrolled for fewer than 12 credits   THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)  The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended (FERPA) does three things:  1. FERPA allows students to have the right to inspect their own records.   2. FERPA creates rules regarding the confidentiality and disclosure of education records. 3. FERPA allows students to ask to have their records amended.    CARLOW UNIVERSITY PROCEDURE FOR STUDENTS TO INSPECT EDUCATION RECORDS  Students who wish to inspect and review their own education records may submit to the registrar a written request  that identifies the records the student wishes to inspect. A university official will make arrangements for access and  notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected, within 45 days after the request was received. A university official may be present during the inspection and review.    Certain documents are excluded from the student’s inspection of his or her education records. These exclusions are:  1) information submitted by the student’s parents; 2) confidential letters of recommendation related to admission, employment, job placement or honors, placed in the file before January 1, 1975, or thereafter when the student has   36 waived the right to inspect and review such letters of recommendation, (c) information about other students, and (d) documents that are not considered “education records. For example, documents that are in the sole possession of the maker of the document and are not shared with anyone else (except a substitute) are not considered education records maintained by the institution.    In general, students cannot inspect education records of other students unless the other student provides his/her written, signed and dated consent.  CARLOW UNIVERSITY PROCEDURES REGARDING DISCLOSURES OF STUDENT RECORDS  Carlow University students are encouraged to allow their parents and guardians to have access to their education records. To authorize disclosure to parents and guardians (and anyone else not listed in the exceptions below), students must provide written, signed and dated, specific authorization specifying the records they wish to share. To do so, students may submit an Authorization to Release Records form with the registrar. The student may email the completed form to the registrar only from the student’s own Carlow University email account. Otherwise, the student’s signature must be hand delivered or mailed to the Office of the Registrar. To revoke this authorization, students may alert the registrar in writing, including by email.    Disclosure with the student’s written consent is by no means mandatory or automatic. If a parent or guardian, or other designated third party wishes to review a specific record, Carlow will respond to that request by reviewing whether Carlow has the student’s written, signed, and dated authorization to disclose on file and weighing other interests. In many cases, the university may choose to share information directly with the student to allow the student to determine how and when to share with others.  Written consent generally required:   The general rule is that Carlow will not disclose personally identifiable information from the records of a student without the student’s prior written consent. The list of exceptions (instances where Carlow may disclose education information without student consent) are set forth below.  Disclosures without student consent:   Carlow may disclose information from education records, including personally identifiable information, without the prior written consent of the student in the following circumstances (some are mandatory disclosures and Carlow has no choice; some are discretionary):  1.    To Carlow University officials who have been determined by the university to have legitimate educational interests in the records. A school official is: a. a person employed by Carlow in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position. Any Carlow employee who needs information about a student in the course of performing instructional, supervisory, advisory, or administrative duties for Carlow University has a legitimate educational interest. For example, human resources and accounting staff may have legitimate educational interests for purposes of tuition reimbursement.   b. a person employed by or under contract to Carlow to perform specific tasks, such as an auditor, consultant, or attorney, a person on the Board of Trustees, or a student serving on an official committee or assisting another school official. Vendors (for example, technology vendors) who receive education records must sign contracts agreeing to use the information only for the purposes designated in their contracts, must agree not to disclose information further and must otherwise agree to the protections and protocols in the Carlow University Non-Disclosure Agreement. 2.    To certain officials of the United States Department of Education, the Comptroller General of the United States, the Attorney General of the United States, and state and local educational authorities in connection with state or federally supported educational programs.   3.    In connection with the student’s request for, or receipt of, financial aid necessary to determine the eligibility, amounts or conditions of financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid.   4.    To organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of Carlow University, provided such organizations agree to protocols regarding the safeguarding of the information.  5.    To accrediting commissions or state licensing or regulatory bodies to carry out their functions.  6.    To parents of a dependent student, as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code. Although Carlow is permitted to disclose under the law, it is Carlow’s policy to disclose only with the student’s consent. 7.    To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena.    37 8.    To appropriate parties in health or safety emergencies.  9.    To officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.   10. To an alleged victim of a crime of violence or sexual offense, the final results of the university disciplinary proceedings against the alleged perpetrator of that crime or offense with respect to that crime or offense.   11. To persons in addition to the victim of a crime of violence or sexual offense, the final results of the Carlow University disciplinary proceedings described in paragraph 10 above but only if the school has determined that a student is the perpetrator of a crime of violence or sexual offense, and with respect to the allegation made against him or her, the student has committed a violation of Carlow University’s rules or policies. Carlow University, in such instances, does not disclose the name of any other student, including a victim or witness without the prior written consent of the other student(s).   12. To a parent regarding the student’s violation of any federal, state, or local law or of any Carlow University rules governing the use or possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if Carlow determines that the student has committed a disciplinary violation with respect to that use or possession, and the student is under 21 at the time of the disclosure to the parent.  13. Directory information. Directory information is personally identifiable information that may be disclosed without the student’s consent. Carlow University designates the following information as directory information:   a. Student’s name b. Address:  home, local, personal email and Carlow email   c. Telephone numbers d. Date and place of birth e. Program of study f. Participation in officially recognized activities and sports g. Dates of attendance  h. Degrees and certificates awarded i. Most recent previously attended school j. Photograph of the student, if available k. Enrollment status (i.e., enrolled, continuing, future enrolled student, reentry, leave of absence, etc.) l. Student honors and awards received. m. The height and weight of athletic team members.   Opting out of the directory:    A student may request that his or her information not be included in the directory. To do so, please complete the Request to Restrict Directory Information (Opt–Out) Form or otherwise submit written notice to the registrar. Failure to request nondisclosure of directory information may result in routine disclosure of one or more of the above-designated categories of personally identifiable directory information. Carlow University does not provide directory information to marketing companies, including credit card companies, ring vendors or the like.    Student Recruiting Information. Carlow University is required to comply with certain requests made by the U.S. Military. Student recruiting information includes ONLY:  name, address, Carlow email address, telephone listing, age or date of birth, class level, academic major, place of birth, degrees received and most recent educational institution attended. It does not include and Carlow University will not provide:  Social Security numbers, race, ethnicity, nationality, GPA, grades, low performing student lists, religious affiliation, students with loans in default, veteran’s status, and information about students no longer enrolled.  Students who opt out of the directory also opt out of student recruiting information.  Records of Requests for Disclosure:  The registrar maintains a record indicating the parties who have requested or obtained personally identifiable information from a student’s education records and the legitimate interests those parties had in requesting or obtaining the information. This record may be inspected by the student. The registrar need not include in the record, disclosures made to the student himself/herself, disclosures made with the student’s written authorization, disclosures to university officials and employees, and disclosures of directory information.    PROCEDURE TO AMEND EDUCATIONAL RECORDS  Students have the right to request that a school amend records that they believe to be inaccurate. misleading, or in violation of their right to privacy. To do so, the student files a written request to amend the record with the Registrar’s Office, Carlow University, 3333 Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA  15213. The request should identify the part of the record that the student wants to have amended and specify why the student believes it to be inaccurate or misleading.     38 Carlow will either amend the record or decide not to amend the record and will so alert the student. If Carlow decides not to amend the record, the student then has the right to request a hearing. Carlow will arrange for the hearing and notify the student reasonably in advance of the date, place and time of the hearing. The hearing will be conducted by an individual  who does not have a direct interest in the outcome. That individual may be an official of Carlow University. The student shall  be afforded a forum for the opportunity to tell his or her side of the story, and present documentation and other information relevant to the issues raised in the original request to amend. The student may be assisted by another person, including an attorney.    After the hearing, Carlow University will prepare a written decision based upon the evidence presented at the hearing. If Carlow determines that the record was inaccurate or misleading, it will amend the record and inform the student in writing. If, after the hearing, Carlow still decides not to amend the record, the student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.  MORE INFORMATION ABOUT FERPA  Students are afforded the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the university to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

To be considered for admission to Carlow as a traditional undergraduate student, applicants must present satisfactory evidence of the ability to achieve at the college level.    In general, students should:  • Follow a college preparatory curriculum in high school (18 units of academic preparation). • Have a B average (preferred). • Have satisfactory scores on the SAT/ACT. Old and new SAT scores (if applicable) will be concorded based on College Board recommendations.  High school and/or home school coursework is one of the most important factors in admissions, particularly to more selective programs. It is strongly recommended that all students follow a college preparatory curriculum throughout high school. Those applying to science or nursing programs should complete both algebra II and chemistry, with trigonometry and advanced sciences also strongly recommended.    The Carlow University Admissions Committee recognizes that school curricula greatly varies, and will consider favorably the application of an academically able student whose preparation and experience differs from the traditional college preparatory program.    Carlow will superscore SAT or ACT exams for admission and scholarship review. In other words, the Admissions Committee will use the applicant’s highest subcomponent scores to create a new composite score. Students scoring below 990 on the SAT or 19 on the ACT are strongly encouraged to re-test, especially if they are interested in qualifying for selective academic programs and/or for significant merit scholarships. Some programs have established an SAT/ACT threshold. Old and new SAT scores (if applicable) will be concorded based on College Board recommendations.   Prospective nursing candidates must possess a minimum 3.00 cumulative high school GPA, scored 1060 or higher on the SAT (taken after March 2016) or 21 or higher on the ACT, and have completed strong science and math courses (preferably with a grade of B or better in each). The Pennsylvania State Board of Nursing requires that applicants accepted into professional nursing programs must have completed, as a minimum, four units of English, three units of social sciences, two units of mathematics (one must be algebra), and two units of lab science, including chemistry.  ADMISSIONS AND SCHOLARSHIP DEADLINES   Carlow operates on a rolling admissions basis, accepting applications from incoming first-year students through August. Due to space limitations in some programs, such as nursing, students are strongly encouraged to complete the application process as soon as possible during their senior year to ensure maximum consideration for admission and scholarships/financial aid.   ADVANCED PLACEMENT AND PLACEMENT TESTS   Incoming first-year students who have taken Advanced Placement (AP) examinations, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations, International Baccalaureate examinations (IB), or any college-level courses prior to enrolling at Carlow University, must submit their official exam scores and/or official college transcripts to the Office of Admission in a timely manner to assure proper credit evaluation and course registration.   TRANSFER REQUIREMENTS   Admission to Carlow University is determined on an individual basis. SAT/ACT scores are not required for transfer students, but may be one of the factors considered for students with minimal college credits.   Carlow accepts transfer credits from institutions recognized as an institution of higher education or accredited by a regional accrediting association recognized by the Council of Higher Education Accreditation. We will make every attempt to utilize the academic credits students earned with those of Carlow’s curriculum and standards. A transfer course evaluation will be completed to approximate if and how courses will transfer. Grades must be a C or above in 100-level or higher courses to be transferred. Developmental courses at the 100-level do not transfer. See page 49 for more on Transfer of Credits.  REQUIRED GPA   15 Students transferring to Carlow for programs in:  • Biology with Master of Science in Cardiovascular Perfusion accelerated option must have a minimum  3.0 GPA and cumulative 3.0 GPA in the sciences.  • Education must have a minimum 3.0 GPA. If the student is transferring 48 or more credits, he/she  must also have successfully passed PAPA I or CORE ETS. • Nursing must have a minimum 3.25 GPA with appropriate coursework. • Pre-Nursing must have a minimum 3.0 GPA. • Respiratory Care must have a minimum 2.5 GPA. • All other programs require a minimum 2.0 GPA.  WHEN TO TRANSFER  • BSN program—Spaces are limited and highly competitive; early application is recommended.  • RN-to-BSN—Students may apply anytime for spring or fall admission. In-class, online, and hybrid formats  are offered. • All other programs—We operate on a rolling admissions basis for transfers, typically through August  each year for the fall semester, and through December for the spring, or as long as space allows.  However, students are encouraged to apply as early as possible.  PROVISIONAL ADMISSION   Occasionally, an applicant is admitted to an undergraduate program as a provisionally admitted student. Provisional  admission is granted to an applicant who does not fully meet all of the admissions criteria, but for whom we believe there is  a strong possibility for academic success. As a condition of provisional admission, students are limited to 12-14 credits for  their first semester, and must attend mandatory meetings with their academic advisor and the Center for Academic Achievement (CAA). Students will have the opportunity to work with their advisors to schedule future semesters.   CONDITIONAL ADMISSION   Occasionally, an applicant is conditionally admitted to an undergraduate program. This occurs when final official documentation is still needed in order to be fully admitted to the university. Conditional admission is based on the student’s ability to provide us with one or more final official transcripts or official standardized test scores, or any other required documentation as requested by the Office of Admissions. Once received, the student will be fully admitted to Carlow. As a conditionally admitted student, registration for the following semester and financial aid are held until a student is fully admitted to the university.   ADMISSIONS PROCEDURES  TRADITIONAL FIRST-YEAR STUDENT ADMISSIONS   Students applying for regular admission should:  • Submit a completed application form by applying online at www.carlow.edu.  • Ask a school counselor to forward a complete, official high school transcript* to the Office of Admissions indicating the student’s cumulative GPA, courses previously taken and grades received, course in which the student is currently enrolled or registered, class rank (if available), and results of achievement and assessment tests.  • Submit scores from the Scholastic Assessment Test of the College Board (SAT) or the American College Testing (ACT) program, unless they are already recorded on the high school transcript. • Submit an essay or letter of recommendation as requested.  • Arrange for a personal interview and a campus visit. Although optional, both are strongly recommended.   *The transcript is considered official if it contains the seal of the institution and is issued directly to Carlow University. Transcripts delivered to the Office of Admissions by students are considered official only when sealed in an envelope, with the institution’s seal over the flap. A final official high school transcript, certifying that a student has earned a high school diploma, is required to be officially enrolled. Faxed transcripts are not considered official. Official GED test scores may be   accepted in lieu of high school transcripts. Carlow University will accept electronic transcripts for admissions purposes,  in PDF format, if:  16  1. The transcript is certified as official from the high school, college and/or proprietary school using a third-party agency for the certification process, such as AVOW Systems, Docufide, National Student Clearinghouse, or  Scrip-Safe. 2. The transcript is emailed to Carlow University as an attached PDF (no screenshots) by a counselor, registrar,  or other school official using a school-issued email address. 3. Carlow University has the right to refuse electronic transcripts or request additional information if there is question about the authenticity of the document.  Admissions counselors are available to assist students and families during the admissions and financial aid processes. In many geographic regions, admissions counselors will visit prospective students and their families at their high schools.  HOME-EDUCATED STUDENTS  Carlow University recognizes the unique experiences and benefits provided to home-educated students, and welcomes  their applications. A home-educated student applying for admission should follow all admissions procedures for regular admissions as stated previously. Additional documentation and/or evaluations of progress may be requested.  Verification of high school graduation must be submitted prior to enrollment at Carlow University, and can be presented through any of the following forms:  • A diploma from a home-school agency governed by a State Board of Education; • A letter from a local school district verifying graduation; or • A copy of the Graduate Equivalency Diploma (GED) transcript.  TRANSFER STUDENTS   Prospective transfer students applying for admission should:  • Contact the Office of Admissions at 412.578.6059 or 1.800.333.2275 or via the website inquiry form. • Submit a completed application form by applying online at www.carlow.edu • Submit an official transcript* from each college and/or proprietary school previously attended—whether or  not credit was earned—to the Office of Admissions; in some instances, an official high school transcript may  also be required.  • Arrange for a personal interview and a campus visit. Although optional, both are strongly recommended.   *The transcript is considered official if it contains the seal of the institution and is issued directly to Carlow University. Transcripts delivered to the Office of Admissions by students are considered official only when sealed in an envelope with the institution’s seal over the flap. Faxed transcripts are not considered official. Carlow University will accept electronic transcripts for admissions purposes, in PDF format, if:  1. The transcript is certified as official from the high school, college and/or proprietary school using a third-party agency for the certification process, such as AVOW Systems, Docufide, National Student Clearinghouse, or  Scrip-Safe. 2. The transcript is emailed to Carlow University as an attached PDF (no screenshots) by a counselor, registrar,  or other school official using a school-issued email address. 3. Carlow University has the right to refuse electronic transcripts or request additional information if there is question about the authenticity of the document.  See page 49 for more on Transfer of Credits.  A catalog or a copy of the course descriptions for all courses taken at an accredited institution outside of Allegheny County may be requested in order to assess transfer credits to be awarded. Admissions counselors will inform candidates when additional information is necessary.     Admissions counselors are available to assist students and family through the admissions and financial aid processes.   17 ADULT STUDENTS   Students who have been out of high school for five or more years, should apply online at www.carlow.edu as an Adult Undergraduate Student.

Specific attendance requirements for each course are established by the instructor. Students should be aware of individual course attendance policies, as they are held accountable for meeting those standards. Students are obligated to be in attendance on days with examinations, major or minor, are scheduled. Students who absent themselves from examinations may be refused permission to take the examination at a later date; may receive a failing grade for the examination missed; and may receive a failing grade for the course. Further, absence from class on a day when an assignment is due does not excuse the student from the obligation to have the assignment turned in on time. Faculty may refuse to accept any work which is turned in late and may assign a failing grade for that work.   ACCELERATED COURSES  Accelerated courses, regardless of delivery mode, have a very specific attendance policy, and faculty teaching these courses have a responsibility to adhere to it. Students who miss more than the equivalent of two class meetings of an eight-week week/accelerated course will receive an F (failing grade). This policy includes partial absences that add up to more than two class meetings.  ONLINE/DISTANCE EDUCATION COURSES  In an online/distance education context, documenting that a student has logged into an online class is not sufficient, by itself, to demonstrate academic attendance by the student. A university must demonstrate that a student participated in class or was otherwise engaged in an academically related activity, such as by contributing to an online discussion or initiating contact with a faculty member to ask a course-related question, in order to constitute attendance.  STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND ABSENCE FOR MANDATORY UNIVERSITY SPONSORED EVENTS  A university-sponsored event is defined as an event directly related to a student’s education or the university community that takes place outside the classroom. Examples include participation in varsity athletics, professional conferences, on-campus theatre productions, and student orientation activities.  A student whose participation in a university-sponsored event is required (such as athletics) or would promote her/his education (such as presenting research at a professional conference) must notify the appropriate faculty member(s) of  39 her/his participation in these particular events, as well as the anticipated absence from class. It is recommended that the student should notify the appropriate faculty member(s) at least one week prior to the actual absence, and, if it is available, present the faculty member with a schedule of her/his events.  The student is responsible for all material and assignments covered during the absence. In the event that a student will be absent from an examination or absent on the due date for an assignment, the student will be expected to make up the examination or submit the assignment at a time and place designated by the faculty member. All students participating in university-sponsored events must be given the opportunity to make up classwork, including labs, assignments, and exams that they miss during attendance at such sponsored events. Every effort should be made to accommodate the student, and there will be no consequences due to missing class for the events (such as point deductions for an assignment, loss of attendance points, unfavorable grade adjustments, or new assignments beyond those listed in the course syllabus).  The student should also discuss the event schedule with her/his academic advisor when registering for courses. To the extent that event schedules are known in advance, and to the extent that multiple sections are offered for particular courses, the student, where it is possible and where it does not adversely affect the integrity of her/his Carlow education, should schedule courses in such a way as to minimize schedule conflicts. Accelerated courses are not recommended for students who are aware that they have extensive travel commitments, evening obligations, or other university-sponsored activities that would cause them to miss such classes. The guidelines established by the university regarding CAP classes will apply. Realizing that circumstances which may cause an absence may vary greatly, any exceptions will be at the discretion of the faculty member on a case-by-case basis.  INDEPENDENT STUDIES AND TUTORIALS  Independent Studies:   Department resources permitting, students may explore areas not covered in the Carlow undergraduate curriculum through independent study. Upper-level students may work independently or design a course to be pursued independently under the guidance of a sponsoring faculty member and with chair/program director approval. Students must have a minimum cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.75 and demonstrate proficiency in dealing with pertinent materials. Students are expected to demonstrate learning outcomes consistent with comparable course work.   Tutorials:   Upper-level courses taught infrequently but listed in the Undergraduate Course Catalog can be taken as tutorials with advisor and faculty member approval, and department resources permitting. Prior to registration, the student must make arrangements with the professor who usually teaches the course. A tutorial may not be taken during a semester in which the same course is being offered as a class session. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the department responsible for the tutorial.  Experiential Learning:   "
EXP 250," provides experiential learning credit for participation in seminars, workshops, conferences, internships, or special events. Such experiences might include leadership conferences, the Mercy-sponsored trip to the United Nations, etc.    can be taken for 1 or 2 credits during the summer terms only. A maximum of three (total) credits may be issued  for any given summer term.  has a special summer pricing structure. Contact Student Accounts for the fixed rate  per credit.   REPEATED COURSES  Students may attempt to improve their grade point average by repeating courses. A student wishing to repeat a course can do so only by taking the same course at Carlow University. When a course has been repeated, both grades remain on the transcript. The grade earned by repeating a course is used in lieu of the grade originally earned and will be used in the calculation of the cumulative GPA. No course may be taken more than three times. No course may be repeated at any other institution in order to have that grade accepted as a replacement for the original grade earned at Carlow University. In some situations, it may be necessary for a student to repeat a course off campus. This situation will be handled on a case-by-case basis with oversight by the appropriate dean.  In the event that a student has failed, or is re-admitted to a program, a course that is no longer offered or for which the student is ineligible to take by determination of the academic department, the department offering the course will decide  40 what course or courses a student may substitute. Students should consult with the Office of Financial Aid for more information on how repeated courses might impact student aid.  WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSE   Withdrawal from a course must be made officially in the Office of the Registrar. A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a particular course after the drop deadline and prior to the final date to withdraw in a given semester, according to the academic calendar published in the Carlow Course Schedule and online via myPortal.   Withdrawing from a course or courses does not withdraw a student from the university. Withdrawal from the University is a separate process.  Grades of students who do not complete a course and who have not withdrawn officially will be listed as F.   CREDIT FOR PRIOR LEARNING  Carlow offers six primary methods for gaining credit for college-level learning that has taken place outside the classroom. Students may obtain credits by means of the following: Advanced Placement Program of the College Board, College Level Examination Program (CLEP) examinations, College in High School courses, Course Challenge or Credit by Examination, Credit for Prior Learning, and the International Baccalaureate program. A student may earn a maximum of 30 credits at Carlow, or elsewhere, through these options, either singly or combined. Any credits earned are not included in the number of credits necessary to satisfy college residence requirements. Carlow is part of the ACE Credit College and University Network that considers ACE recommendations for military training and experience. Carlow will also review additional types of credit for prior learning on a case-by-case basis.  Advanced Placement Program of the College Board:   A student who has taken college-level courses in one or more subjects in high school and has submitted the results of the College Board Advanced Placement (AP) Tests will be considered for advanced placement. Test scores of 3, 4, or 5 may entitle the student to academic credit in course areas corresponding to the advanced study. Scores are submitted to the Office of Admissions, usually at the time of application for admission. The university registrar will consult with the appropriate academic department to assign course equivalencies.   College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Eligibility:   Carlow accepts CLEP credit for scores at or above the recommended score of 50 or higher. Credit cannot be awarded if  the student has already taken an equivalent course or a course at a more advanced level in the same discipline. CLEP scores  are only applied to Core requirements. CLEP credit does not affect grade point average and does not count for residency requirements.  College in High School (CHS):   A student who has taken College in High School (CHS) courses in one or more subjects during high school and has submitted official transcripts from the awarding institution will be considered for college credit. A grade of C or better will be accepted for college credit. Course equivalency is determined by the Office of the Registrar in consultation with the appropriate academic department. Official transcripts are submitted to the Office of Admissions, usually at the time of application for admission.   Course Challenge or Credit by Examination:   Some courses may be challenged for either credit or exemption by passing an examination and/or by satisfying another means of evaluation. Students may qualify for challenge if they have not already attempted to pass or challenge the course or have not been enrolled in the course for more than four weeks. (For CAP and Weekend courses, consult the department office for appropriate time frame.)   To challenge the course, students must submit to the appropriate academic department a declaration of intention as well as reasonable evidence of preparation. After a student has successfully challenged a course for credit, the course is entered onto the transcript and the notation “Credit by Challenge” is posted in lieu of a grade. Credits earned by challenge are charged at a special fee. If a student chooses exemption, the exemption is noted by the Office of the Registrar, and there is no fee. Students are permitted one attempt to successfully challenge or exempt themselves from a given course.  41 Prior Learning Portfolio/Learning Counts:   Available to matriculated students with five years of professional experience that aligns with Carlow University courses. Upon successful completion of a three-credit portfolio development course "
CAEL 100,", students will be able to: identify areas of their own learning from numerous settings such as training, work, community volunteering, and self-study; describe learning from experience, reflect on the learning, and synthesize ideas and the ideas of others; build a deep understanding of lifelong learning; discuss and apply experiential learning theory, models, and concepts; apply critical reflection to consider the nature and value of learning from experience; demonstrate an appropriate balance of practical and theoretical understanding; prepare learning narratives that demonstrate learning comparable to college level courses; identify research, gather, organize, and write documentation that supports learning in order to build a learning portfolio. Portfolio credits may be earned in all Carlow University courses with the exception of the following: major courses (SW prefix) within the Bachelor of Social Work; major courses (NU prefix) within the Bachelor of Science in Nursing except for "
NU 413," and .  , , .  .   Writing Skills Lab for the RN  This senior course focuses on the development of writing skills to professional levels of competency. This includes the use of APA format and information technology to produce written assignments that meet the professional practice standards of Nursing. A culmination of tools, rubrics, and mechanics will be incorporated throughout this course, emphasizing written communication and information literacy skills that are essential to baccalaureate Nursing education. Use of Learning Management System (LMS) will actively engage students in evidence-based practice and writing activities that include research database searches, discussion boards, blogs, and wiki media. 1 credit (1 theory/0 clinical)   PREREQUISITE:  .  , .  .  .  HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT  "
NU 420,"; major courses (RC prefix) in the Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Care.  International Baccalaureate Program:   Students who have completed the International Baccalaureate Program and score 5 or above on the examinations may qualify for Carlow University credit. In most cases, credits awarded will be for elective credit only.   DEGREE/CERTIFICATE REQUIREMENTS   General requirements for a degree for all students include the following:   Proficiency in the English Language:   Each student is expected to demonstrate in all course work the ability to speak and write with precision and clarity, showing evidence of competent command of the English language.   Residence:   Students must earn a minimum of 32 credits in courses taken at Carlow University in order to fulfill the residence requirements of the university. In addition, each major also has a specified residence requirement. Please check the specific major section of the catalog; however, students are required to take a minimum of 18 credits in a major at Carlow. The total number of credits that any transfer student will need to take at Carlow will be a combination of university residence requirements, major residence requirements, and general education requirements as specified on the transfer evaluation issued upon admission to the university.   Credits earned through Advanced Placement, CLEP, College in High School, Course Challenge, Prior Learning Portfolio/Learning Counts, or International Baccalaureate cannot be considered as part of the residence requirements.   Specific Program Requirements:   Candidates for Pennsylvania Teacher Certification must maintain a 3.0 GPA to remain in good standing. Students in the nursing program must attain a 3.0 GPA to enter the specialized nursing sequences in the sophomore year and maintain a  3.0 each semester thereafter. Students majoring in biology who expect to be accepted in perfusion technology must present a 3.0 GPA.   Grade Point Average:   To qualify for a degree/certificate, a student must attain a cumulative academic average of 2.0 GPA by the completion of the degree/certificate. Students in degree programs must officially apply to graduate and must have a minimum of 120 credits (consult the specific academic program). Certificate students must alert the Office of the Registrar when they are about to complete the certificate requirements.  Capstone Experience:   Graduating seniors are usually assessed in their major through examinations, comprehensive seminars, research presentations, practica, and/or internships.     42 General Education Requirements:   The Carlow Compass and Core Curriculum requirements are listed in this catalog.   Academic Major Requirements:   Specific requirements for majors are listed within each department section of this catalog. Students are required to take a minimum of 18 credits in a major at Carlow.   Students who change their program of study (major) will be governed by the catalog in effect when the change is made.  Minor Requirements:   To earn a minor in an academic discipline, students must complete a minimum number of credits defined by the academic discipline. At least half of the credits for the minor must be completed with Carlow courses.   Student Responsibility:   Students are personally responsible for meeting all degree requirements governed by the catalog in effect at their time of enrollment. Advisors will assist them in academic planning.    DISABILITIES SERVICES OFFICE   This is a summary of Disabilities Services Guidelines and Policies. To access the full list of both, please see the Carlow University website at www.carlow.edu.  Carlow University makes reasonable accommodations to provide qualified students with disabilities the opportunity to take full advantage of programs, activities, services, and facilities. The university’s Disabilities Services Office (DSO) arranges specific reasonable accommodations for students and prospective students with disabilities. Current documentation regarding a student’s disability is required and will be treated as confidentially as possible; it is not released without the student’s consent, unless required by law. The Disabilities Services Office (DSO), faculty, and the student work together to identify appropriate academic adjustments, auxiliary aids and services, and/or other reasonable accommodations that may be warranted under particular circumstances.   Individuals with disabilities are encouraged to contact the university’s Disabilities Services representative in advance of the semester when accommodations/adjustments may be needed. Accommodations cannot be granted retroactively.   Carlow University has the right to establish qualifications and other essential standards and requirements for its courses, programs, activities, and services. All students are expected to meet these essential qualifications, standards, and requirements, with or without reasonable accommodations.   Students with disabilities who are requesting accommodations should contact the Disabilities Services representative at 412.578.6257 to arrange a meeting and discuss specific guidelines. Copies of these guidelines for receiving accommodations are available from the Office of Disability Services.  GRADES  GRADING AND GRADE POINT AVERAGE (GPA)   Instructors publish their grading policies so students know exactly how course grades will be determined. The following letter grades and their grade point equivalents are used at the university:   Grade  Points  Grade  Points  A+   4.00  C   2.00  A   4.00  C-   1.75  A-   3.75  D+   1.25  B+   3.25  D   1.00  B   3.00  D-   0.75 B-   2.75  F   0.00  C+   2.25   43 NOTE: MINIMUM PASSING GRADE REQUIRED MAY VARY BY MAJOR.   The cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) is obtained by dividing the total points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted.  GRADING—NO POINTS ASSIGNED  AU  Audit—no points assigned CC  Credit by Challenge EE  Exempt by Examination I   Incomplete (See Incomplete Grade Policy on page 48). IP   Course in progress for seminar, research, or internship extending beyond one semester  M   Military Leave of Absence NG   No grade or problem with grade reported by instructor P/F   Course offered by Pass/Fail only WD   Withdrawn   AUDITING A COURSE   Students may audit a course with the instructor’s permission and must register through the Office of the Registrar. Students should consult with Student Accounts regarding fees for auditing a course. A grade of AU is given for an audited course with no credit.   PASS/FAIL OPTION   The Pass/Fail option permits students to explore disciplines without jeopardizing Grade Point Average (GPA). The option must be exercised on the student’s original registration or by the end of the add/drop period. Only electives can be completed with this option. The maximum number of credits earned under the Pass/Fail option is 15.   HONORS AND ACADEMIC RECOGNITION  DEAN’S LIST   Eligibility for the Dean’s List is determined each semester, not cumulatively. Students are eligible for the Dean’s List under the following conditions:   • Completion of 12 credits at Carlow, including the semester under consideration; • Enrollment in at least 12 credits for the semester in question (students who register for less than 12 credits in a semester should refer to Academic Recognition of Part-time Students below); and  • A GPA of 3.5 or above for the semester in question.  ACADEMIC RECOGNITION OF PART-TIME STUDENTS  Eligibility for academic recognition of part-time students is determined each semester, not cumulatively. Students are eligible for academic recognition under the following conditions:   • Completion of six credits at Carlow, including the semester in question; • Enrollment in six credits (eight in the upper-level BSN completion program) for the semester in question; and  • A GPA of 3.5 or above for the semester in question.  VALEDICTORIAN and SALUTATORIAN     One valedictorian and one salutatorian are selected each Commencement ceremony from all eligible students in the graduating baccalaureate class. The distinction of valedictorian is given to the candidate who has achieved the highest level of academic performance in his/her Commencement class and the salutatorian distinction is the candidate who ranks second in scholarship. Criteria are based primarily on cumulative grade point average and number of credits completed in residence at Carlow University. In the event that more than one student may qualify for the valedictorian distinction, no salutatorian is selected.     44 Eligibility criteria:  1. Candidates must have completed all graduation requirements or designated official has verified that candidate anticipates completing all graduation requirements for the Commencement ceremony. 2. Candidates must have completed at least fifty credits for which letter grades were earned in residence at  Carlow University. 3. The cumulative grade point average that is used in the determination of candidacy is calculated using the cumulative GPA determined at the end of CAP III for the May Commencement ceremony.  INCOMPLETE GRADE POLICY  An incomplete grade (I grade) at the end of a course is reserved for those students who have completed at least 75 percent of the course work, have a passing grade in the course, and for good reason (mitigating or extenuating circumstances) have assignments or examinations to complete. Incompletes are given at the discretion of the instructor for the course; the instructor makes the final decision to award an incomplete.   The I grade is automatically changed to ‘F’ by the Office of the Registrar if not removed within the required time frame (six calendar weeks from the end of the semester in which the I grade was assigned). For example, if the I grade is assigned at the end of the spring semester, the summer semester will be counted as part of the six weeks. In this situation, a spring incomplete grade change form will need to be submitted during the last week of June. Official deadlines for each semester will be supplied by the registrar and posted on myPortal.   Once the student has completed the work, the instructor notifies the registrar by submitting a Change of Grade form to the Office of the Registrar. Instructors reserve the right to require that work be submitted prior to the sixth-week deadline in any given term. If an extension for an incomplete grade is needed, instructors must submit an Incomplete Extension form with Dean’s approval to the Office of the Registrar prior to the six-week deadline.  Credits assigned the grade of incomplete are not considered earned credits until completion.  IN PROGRESS (IP) GRADES   The IP grade is reserved for certain courses where it is anticipated that a student’s work will extend into the next semester (e.g. thesis, project, internship, clinical, a third student teaching experience, etc.).   At the end of the semester in which the student completes the work, an earned grade will be assigned which replaces the IP grade. Individual programs may place a time limit on completion of the thesis, creative project, internship, or clinical course. Students should check with their individual program directors.   Students who are carrying an IP grade and do not register for classes for two or more semesters will have the IP grade converted to an NG (no grade). If those students are readmitted to the university, they will register and pay for the original course again with its associated credits.  GRADE CHANGES AND GRADE APPEALS  Once a grade has been submitted to the Office of the Registrar, the grade cannot be changed unless there has been an error or grade reconsideration on the part of the faculty member. To change a grade, the faculty member must complete the Change of Grade form and obtain the appropriate department chair’s or program director’s signature. Completed forms are to be submitted to the Office of the Registrar by the faculty member.  Students who have questions regarding a final course grade are to first consult with the faculty member who originally awarded the grade. Any request for a grade reconsideration must be made to the faculty member in writing/email within  30 calendar days of the beginning of the semester following the one for which the first grade was first issued. If the faculty member does not believe the evidence warrants a change of grade, the student may appeal within 30 calendar days of the faculty member’s written/emailed decision by following the appeal process outlined below.  If an acceptable solution cannot be reached by discussion with the faculty member, the student may appeal by sending a written statement to the faculty member and department chair/program director, along with any supporting evidence.  The department chair/program director will then work with the faculty member to review and assess the student’s claims. The decision will be communicated to the student in email by the department chair/program director, and will be final.   45 This process is not intended to replace informal conferences between a student and a faculty member concerning the issuance of a grade. In the event the instructor is the department chair/program director, the student should consult with the dean of the college.  INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD  Federal law protects the individual’s right to privacy and protects citizens from harm from others. Research involving human subjects is reviewed to safeguard those rights. Carlow University has convened an Institutional Review Board (IRB) to ensure that all human subject research and/or projects that include data collection from human subjects is reviewed in advance by responsible, knowledgeable peers to protect these rights. Carlow University is committed to these laws based on moral, ethical, and legal grounds. All research that comes under the aegis of the university must meet the procedures established to ensure the privacy and protection of human subjects. These procedures are followed by faculty in their own research, and by students in any research they conduct, regardless of where it is actually conducted. Additional guidelines can be found on myPortal.  GUEST STUDENT ENROLLMENT STATUS  Guest students (non-matriculated students) are those who are non-degree seeking—that is, students who are either taking credit-bearing courses but not seeking degrees or seeking to earn a certificate. Guest students are not eligible for financial aid or academic recognition; they are subject to the rules and regulations of the university. Guest students are limited to a maximum of 12 credits and may not exceed more than two classes per semester.   PLACEMENT TESTING   New First--Year Traditional Students:   Prior to starting mathematics coursework at Carlow University, incoming first-year students will test in mathematics to evaluate essential foundational skills that are important for success in college. The test results serve to identify the appropriate starting point in mathematics, particularly in certain majors, and/or become part of baseline information. Specific programs may require additional placement tests.   Carlow University’s Compass requires all new traditional students to take a two-course writing sequence: SKW101 Foundations of Writing and SKW102 Foundations of Writing II. Each course is designed to prepare students for the rigors of college writing and research. If a student wishes to skip the first course in the sequence (SKW101), that student may try to place into the second course in the sequence by taking a writing placement test. Placement tests are NOT required. Students who wish to take the two-course writing course sequence will register for SKW101 during registration. If students opt to take the test, this will occur at the time of registration.  New Traditional and Adult Transfer Students:   Math placement tests evaluate basic competencies for students who do not have transfer equivalency credit for core requirements. The results are used to identify the appropriate starting level course.  Students who take placement tests may be required to take an additional course based upon their final score on this evaluation. This course in addition to the standard curriculum may lengthen the duration of the program and increase the overall cost. Additional earned credits will be applied to the total number of credits required for graduation.  Students may submit to the Registrar’s office prior writing courses for transfer equivalency. All prior courses will be evaluated for equivalency by the director of skills writing at the time of registration. If students have not taken writing courses at prior institutions or if their courses do not transfer, they have the option to take the placement test in an effort to place out of the first writing course in the sequence. All placement testing occurs at the time of registration.  RE-ADMISSION PROCEDURE TO THE UNIVERSITY   Re-admission procedures have been established for the following categories of students:   • Any student who attended Carlow as a matriculated undergraduate or graduate student and withdrew before completing a degree   46 • Any student who has not attended Carlow for a period of four semesters, including the summer terms • Any student who has been academically dismissed should see the Academic Standing section on page 33.   These students should contact the Office of Admissions and:   1. Complete and submit a re-admission application.  2. Submit official transcripts* if post-secondary institutions were attended after leaving Carlow.   Include course descriptions from each college outside of Allegheny County. Due to changing admission and curriculum requirements, the university reserves the right to re-evaluate all academic courses, whether completed at Carlow or elsewhere, to determine what will be credited toward the student’s degree. The university also reserves the right to request placement tests, where appropriate, and to assign the student’s advisor prior to enrollment.   Students are re-admitted on the academic standing status they held when they last attended Carlow University.  Students follow the catalog in effect at the time of re-admission. Some exceptions may apply. Students should refer to Academic Forgiveness on page 32 for additional information on re-admission and academic standing.   *The transcript is considered official if it contains the seal of the institution and is issued directly to Carlow University. Transcripts delivered to the Office of Admissions by students are considered official only when sealed in an envelope with the institution’s seal over the flap. Faxed transcripts are not considered official. International students may send or deliver transcripts directly to the Office of Admissions.   *Carlow University will accept electronic transcripts for admissions purposes if the following criteria are met regarding  the transcript:  1. The transcript is certified as official from the high school, college and/or proprietary school using a third-party agency for the certification process. Approved agencies include AVOW Systems, Docufide, National Student Clearinghouse, and Scrip-Safe. 2. The transcript must be a PDF certified document that has no indication of tampering. 3. A college official must receive the transcript from an approved e-transcript service.  4. Carlow University has the right to refuse electronic transcripts or request additional information if there is question about the authenticity of the document.  RE-ADMISSION FOLLOWING MILITARY DEPLOYMENT  Carlow University has established re-admission policies to assist students who have been called to serve on active duty during the academic year. Students who will be out for a standard leave of absence time frame will follow the university policies associated with a traditional leave of absence time frame. Exceptions to this are cited in the university military and refund deployment policy. Students who return from military service within the leave of absence time frame (one to three semesters, including summer) will re-enter the university under the catalog for which they started their program of study. Students may enter under their original catalog unless the program requirements have changed significantly and the department overseeing the program recommends that the student move to the newest catalog with updated program requirements.  ADD/DROP AND LEAVE OF ABSENCE/COMPLETE WITHDRAWAL NOTIFICATION  Non-attendance in classes does not constitute an official withdrawal and may result in full financial obligation.   Students seeking to drop all classes and to withdraw or take a leave of absence from the university must complete a Withdrawal/Leave of Absence form and submit it to the Office of the Registrar. The withdrawal form is available in the Office of the Registrar and other student service offices, and online on myPortal. Students dropping all courses cannot use a Change of Registration form. Students can take a leave of absence for one to three semesters, including summer terms. Students should contact the Office of the Registrar upon returning for registration instructions.   • Students who are considering withdrawal should investigate the financial implications prior to any action.  • Financial aid recipients are urged to contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine how financial aid amounts will be affected by any withdrawal.  • For complete withdrawal from all classes in a semester, final determination of refund amounts will be made by the Office of Student Accounts and will be based on the date that the student initiated the withdrawal process by submitting the Withdrawal/Leave of Absence form to the Office of the Registrar.   47 • Students wishing to withdraw from the residence hall must complete a Residence Hall Withdrawal Form, available in the Student Life section of myPortal. Refunds of room and board charges are governed by the Housing and Food Service Agreement signed by the student for the academic year.  • Students who do not return from a leave of absence or who are not registered for four consecutive semesters will be unofficially withdrawn from the university. Students who are unofficially withdrawn are still responsible for outstanding tuition balances. • Refunds of Residence Hall deposits are processed upon request if the housing agreement has not been broken and if the student owes no outstanding balance or fine to the university. • Students seeking to take a leave of absence or withdrawal from the university for military activation must contact the Office of the Registrar.  ADD/DROP   A student who officially drops a course(s) during the designated add/drop period posted by the Office of the Registrar but who is still registered for at least one course in the semester will receive a full refund of charges for the course(s) dropped.   For dropped courses, any refund of charges will be based on the date that the Change of Registration Form is received by the Office of the Registrar. Graduate students and undergraduate students at the sophomore level and above can make changes in registration using WebAdvisor during the add/drop period.  Add/drop deadlines are posted in the academic calendar, published in the university Course Schedule and on myPortal, and are also listed at the Office of the Registrar.   Financial aid recipients should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine if the aid amount will be affected by a planned change in registration.  REFUND POLICY  In some cases, students are entitled to a full or partial refund of charges. Refund amounts are connected to the student’s official date of drop or withdrawal. Official dates and percentage of refund amounts are published in the academic calendar each semester in the Carlow University Course Schedule, on the university website, and in the student accounts section in myPortal. Specific questions about the refunds should be directed to the Office of Student Accounts.   MILITARY DEPLOYMENT AND REFUND POLICY  The university will assist a student who is currently enrolled in an academic semester and who is called to active military duty with transition out of the university as quickly as possible. The student must file written documentation of the activation order with the registrar. The student may then choose one of three options by contacting the Office of the Registrar.  1. A student can take the grade s/he has earned to date in the class provided that the student has completed at least 75% of the course work, has a passing grade in the course, and the student and faculty agree with this option. A student selecting this option will not be refunded any tuition or fees and will have his/her grade processed in the normal manner at the end of the semester with appropriate credits and grade awarded. 2. A student can choose to have an Incomplete (I) grade recorded at the end of the semester provided that the student has completed at least 75% of the course work, has a passing grade in the course, and the student and faculty agree with this option. The student and faculty will need to discuss the completion requirements for the course. A student who has selected the incomplete grade option will have one year after return from active duty to contact the university to arrange for completion of the credits. If the incomplete is not satisfied in this time period, the grade will be converted to an F. The student choosing this option will not receive a refund of tuition and fees. 3. A student can choose to process a withdrawal from one or all courses with an M grade at any time during the semester in which active military deployment occurs by informing the Office of the Registrar. Tuition and fees will be refunded or credited in full with no credit awarded for the term. The student should be aware that this option may result in the need to return funds to the university. The Financial Aid and Student Accounts Offices will inform the student of the impact of this option on the student account.  A student who resides on campus and who leaves for active duty assignment will be released from his/her housing contract for room and board. Fees will be refunded for the unused portion of the contract on a pro rata basis.   48 REGISTRATION APPEALS  Changes to registration status resulting from injury to student or immediate family member, death in immediate family, sudden severe illness, accident, or exceptional trauma that is affecting the student’s emotional and physical health may be cause for an appeal of change of registration deadlines and/or charges. Students must complete an appeal form, attach appropriate documentation, and send it to the Appeals Committee at appeals@carlow.edu. The committee consists of a representative from the Offices of Academic Affairs, Admissions, Financial Aid, Registrar, Student Accounts, and Student Affairs, as well as faculty members. The student will receive a written response within 30 days of submission of the appeal.   REGISTRATION  A student is officially registered for a course when named on the official class roster. Grades and credits will not be  recorded for any course for which a student is not officially registered. Upon registration, a student agrees to pay all  charges on the student account for that enrollment period according to the standard payment terms available on myPortal. Default of payment will result in a hold on future registration and release of transcripts. Tuition refund policies, deadlines, and more details for each semester are available on myPortal and in the Student Hub. Only officially registered students  may attend class.  For students seeking to take more than 18 credits (credit overload), see Office of the Registrar for more information.  CHANGE OF REGISTRATION   Students may change registration without academic penalty during the official add/drop period. Full-time traditional students who fall below 12 credits may lose financial aid and/or suffer financial penalties. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for details. These dates are published in the Carlow University Course Schedule and on myPortal. Students must have written permission from the instructor and advisor to add a course after the first week of classes.   In Carlow accelerated courses, change of registration must be completed one day prior to the beginning of the second class. Students who miss the equivalent of more than two sessions cannot receive a passing grade for the course. A WD is assigned if a student officially withdraws from a particular course prior to the final date to withdraw in a given semester. Grades of students who do not complete a course and who have not withdrawn officially will be listed as F.   See Carlow University Course Schedule and myPortal for official dates.   CROSS-REGISTRATION   After their first semester at Carlow, all full-time students earning a Grade Point Average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher are eligible to register, through Carlow, for one course each semester to be taken at any of the other nine colleges and universities which are members of the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education, provided the course is open for cross-registration and the student has met the prerequisites. The registrant must have the approval of the appropriate dean, major advisor, and the university registrar. Grades earned through cross registration are posted on the Carlow transcript and counted in the GPA. Students may not repeat courses for which they received a D- or above at Carlow for credit or to replace a grade. Students must meet the prerequisites at the host institution. Cross registration privileges are not available for summer classes. Cross registration forms are available on myPortal. There is no additional tuition charge to cross-register, although students may be assessed course fees (e.g. for courses with a laboratory component) by the host institution. Students are responsible for special course or lab fees at the host institution. Academic rules and regulations of the host institution prevail.   There are nine schools where Carlow students can cross-register:   • Carnegie Mellon University  • Chatham University  • Community College of Allegheny County  • Duquesne University  • LaRoche College  • Pittsburgh Theological Seminary  • Point Park University  • Robert Morris University  • University of Pittsburgh   49 TRANSFER OF CREDITS  Students transferring to Carlow from other institutions may have up to 88 credits accepted. A grade of C or higher must have been earned. Courses taken for pass/fail or satisfactory/unsatisfactory grades may only be transferred if it can be verified that a pass or satisfactory grade is equivalent to a C or higher. Only the credit is transferred, not the grade. A transfer evaluation will be done after a student is accepted and after all catalog or course descriptions have been received. It is the responsibility of the student to obtain the course descriptions or catalogs from all colleges or universities outside of Allegheny County.  Once a student matriculates at Carlow University, the student must have permission from the faculty advisor and the university registrar/transfer coordinator prior to beginning a class at another institution. Students may be permitted to transfer a maximum of four classes or sixteen (16) credits from other universities, exclusive of cross-registration. The student is also responsible for requesting that the registrar at the host institution forward an official transcript to the Office of the Registrar at Carlow University. Credit will not be accepted for a course if a student has not obtained formal permission from the advisor and university registrar/transfer coordinator to take the course. Appropriate forms are available in the Student Hub and on myPortal.  Students may be awarded credits for vocational/technical programs of study. In the event a student qualifies for a technical block award, the credits can be used as elective credit only and may not be used as equivalent coursework in any of Carlow’s academic programs or in fulfillment of any academic requirement. Coursework taken in vocational and technical programs of study is subject to the same transfer policies as other college level coursework.  Carlow University makes no promises about the transferability of its credits to another institution of higher education. Transferability of credits is determined exclusively by each receiving institutions. Typical considerations involve whether the course substitutes for a course in the curriculum at the other institution, whether the student received a certain grade or better, how long ago the course was taken, how many credits the student seeks to transfer, and other factors. Students who plan to transfer credits from Carlow can check with the registrar to see if there is an affiliation agreement in place and with the other institution to learn about their policies regarding transfer of credits before taking the courses when possible.   DUAL MAJORS  A student can pursue dual undergraduate majors at Carlow resulting in a single or double degree (BA, BS, BSN, and/or BSW). Both majors must be completed before any degree is awarded.  The student must complete the requirements for both majors, earning a minimum of 120 credits, although the student may need to complete more than 120 credits to fulfill both majors’ requirements. All requirements of each major must be satisfied before the degree(s) is conferred.  SECOND DEGREE FOR STUDENTS  Whether a student has completed a previous Carlow undergraduate degree or a degree at another institution, he or she must complete a minimum of 32 credits at Carlow for the additional degree. While previous courses can fulfill requirements if appropriate, 32 more Carlow credits must be completed to be awarded a second degree. In order to fulfill the requirements of the second degree, it is possible students may need to take more than the 32-credit minimum. Core curriculum requirements are waived for the second-degree students.   Students who previously earned a Carlow University bachelor’s degree and are returning to complete the requirements for Bachelor of Science in Nursing or the Second Degree in Nursing program should refer to Office of Admissions for specific residency requirements.  Residence Requirement: Refer to Degree Requirements section on page 41.  PENNSYLVANIA TRANSFER AND ARTICULATION CENTER  Carlow University participates in the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Center. Course equivalences between Carlow and other participating institutions are defined on the PaTrac website: http://www.patrac.org/  A student who completes an associate degree as defined in the Program to Program articulations will enter Carlow in the junior year. Students will not be required to complete Carlow Compass requirements.  Major courses requirements are determined by the major department.  50 TUITION AND FEES   A complete listing of charges and fees is available on the Carlow website at www.carlow.edu/tuition_and_fees and on myPortal. The university reserves the right to modify these charges if circumstances require. Payment options and student account policies are also listed on myPortal under the Student Hub/Student Accounts Tab.  STUDENT ACCOUNTS PAYMENT POLICIES  Each semester, payment is due by the due date published on myPortal. A student must pay the balance due or begin an official payment plan to cover any balance that will not be cleared by pending financial aid in order to begin attending classes and to move into the residence halls.  Ten business days prior to the start of the semester, registration may be voided for any returning student who owes an outstanding balance of $4,000.00 or more for any previous and/or upcoming semesters combined after any finalized financial aid would be applied to the student account and who has not made payment arrangements with the Student Accounts Office. A notification letter will be sent to any student whose registration has been voided. Registration can be reinstated within the first week of the semester after the student pays the balance due or makes satisfactory payment arrangements. Reinstatement of registration will be subject to course availability.  Student accounts are audited during the semester and bursar holds are added to delinquent accounts. A bursar hold prevents receipt of transcripts. A registration hold is also placed on an account that has a delinquent balance of $1000  or higher.   Upon graduation, a student must pay all outstanding obligations to the university prior to receiving a diploma and transcripts.   A student who is no longer enrolled at the university and has an outstanding balance must make satisfactory payment arrangements or the account may be placed with a collection agency, incur additional collection agency/legal fees of up to 33 1/3% of the balance due, and be reported to credit reporting agencies.  CARLOW UNIVERSITY CREDIT HOUR POLICY  Carlow University complies with federal (U.S. Department of Education) and Middle States Commission of Higher Education (MSCHE) and Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) regulations pertaining to degree requirements and credit hours. Carlow University undergraduate degrees require the successful completion of 120 semester credit hours. All graduate degrees require a minimum of 30 semester credit hours.  Carlow University’s academic year is separated into fall, spring and summer semesters. Fall and spring are traditionally 15 weeks in length with an additional week for finals. Accelerated semesters (CAP/WEC) are typically five or eight weeks in length. Summer classes generally run for eight weeks. All formats, including traditional semester-length classes and the accelerated and summer formats, must comply with the university credit hour policy.  All new courses will have a credit hours calculation worksheet completed as part of new course development. For accelerated and weekend courses, faculty must also document, through their extended syllabi how CAP/WEC courses will meet the minimum semester credit hour requirement. In addition, existing courses are reviewed periodically by the college dean and Office of the Registrar to ensure that the workload is consistent with the potential credits to be earned.  BACKGROUND  The U.S. Department of Education, at 34 CFR Section 600.2, defines “credit hour” as:   “…an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:   (1) one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or,    51 (2) at least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.”   The Pennsylvania regulation states, in part, “A semester credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty. A quarter credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 10 hours or classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty.” 22 Pa. Code Section 31.21(b).u  The Middle States Commission on Higher Education, in its Credit Hour Policy, effective August 23, 2013, requires institutions to verify compliance with Credit Hour regulations.   CARLOW UNIVERSITY CREDIT HOUR POLICY  Carlow University has adopted the credit hour as the unit measure of instruction for awarding credit.     At Carlow University, a credit hour is equivalent to one hour of classroom instruction (50 minutes) with a normal expectation of two hours of outside study for each class session. Typically, a three-semester credit hour course meeting for 45 total hours over 15 weeks requires 90 total hours of out of class academic engagement. Carlow adheres to the Federal standard of a total expectation of 45 total learning hours (15 hours for every 1 credit earned) in a semester regardless of time frame of delivery.    CARLOW UNIVERSITY COURSE METHODS  Delivery method:  1. Onsite–All classes meet at a site (can be a combination of campus and another site, ex. Clinical Rotation or  Student Teaching). 2. Hybrid–Online meetings reduce the number of face-to-face meetings. Hybrid courses will have meeting  dates onsite. 3. Online–All content is delivered online. There are no required face-to-face meetings.  Levels of synchronicity:  1. Completely Synchronous–Regardless of whether the faculty member and students are in the same location  or are online, they have at least 45 hours together at the same time (in real time) for a 3-credit lecture or  seminar course.   2. At least 50% synchronous–Regardless of whether the faculty member and students are in the same location or are online, they have at least 22.5 hours but less than 45 hours together at the same time (in real time) for a 3-credit lecture or seminar course. CAP/WEC college format courses generally follow this formula. 3. Less than 50% synchronous–Regardless of whether the faculty member and students are in the same location or are online, they have more than 0 but less than 22.5 together at the same time (in real time) for a 3-credit lecture or seminar course. 0 but less than 21 hours for CAP/WEC college format. 4. Completely Asynchronous–The faculty member and students do not meet in real time together. This would be a pure online section with no real-time meetings.  Instructional format:   Clinical   Practicum Externship  Seminar Field Placement  Student Teaching Independent Study  Studio Internship  Thesis Lab   Tutorial Lecture      52 CARLOW UNIVERSITY CREDIT HOUR REQUIREMENTS  Method of attributing credits per course:  Undergraduate credits are assigned per semester as follows:   • Lecture/Seminar 3 credits. 1 hour of classroom instruction and 2 hours of outside study per credit. 45 total hours per credit with 90 total hours of out of class academic engagement equaling 135 total hours for three credits over 15-week format. • Accelerated CAP/ Weekend courses   3 hours per week over 8-week format, plus additional hours of equivalent instructional activities. 135 total hours for three credits. • Lab 1 credit. 2-4 hours per week depending on the program, with 2 or more hours of student prep time per week over 15-week format.  • Clinical 1 credit per 60 hours of clinical contact. • Student Teaching 12 credits per semester. 640 hours of total student teaching. 16 weeks, 8 hours per day/5 days per week. • Internship/Externship 1-6 credits. 45 hours in field per credit. • Psychology Internship 1 credit. 45 hours in field per credit. • Art Therapy Practicum 1 credit. 45 hours in field per credit. • Field Placement 3-5 credits. 135 to 225 hours in the field per credit depending on the program. • Online Refer to calculating credit hours for synchronous and asynchronous environments. • Studio 3 credits. 50-minute clock hours. 60 total hours over 15-week format. • Independent Study/Tutorial Credits vary; contact hours will vary based upon program and or program requirements and will meet minimum credit hour requirements.  Specialized Graduate credits are assigned as follows:  • Nursing Clinical 1 credit per 75 hours of clinical contact. • Doctor of Nursing Practicum 1 credit = 200 hours • Thesis  3-6 credits. Hours variable per program. • Internship/Practicum 1-4 credits. 45-100 field experience hours per credit. • Professional Counseling Practicum 3 credits. 100 hours of field experience, plus additional hours of class/preparation time. 135 total hours for three credits. • Doctor of Psychology Practicum 3 credits. 300 hours of field experience. • Doctor of Psychology Internship 9 credits. 2000 hours of internship experience. • Student Teaching 6 credits per semester. 640 hours of total student teaching. 16 weeks, 8 hours per day/5 days per week.  Credit Hours for Online, Hybrid, and Accelerated/Weekend Courses  Credit hours for online or hybrid learning courses, as well as accelerated and weekend courses at Carlow, must adhere to the Federal standard of a total expectation of 45 total learning hours for every 1 credit (15 hours of instruction with 30  53 hours of out of class academic engagement) earned in a semester regardless of time frame of delivery. All course developers are expected to complete the credit hours calculation worksheet as part of new course development. For accelerated and weekend courses, faculty must also document, through their extended syllabi how CAP/WEC courses will meet the minimum semester credit hour requirement.  Calculating Credit Hours for Synchronous or Asynchronous Environments  The following is a brief description of the types of activities that can be included in learning hour calculations. Many courses will present unique learning activities not directly covered in the exact or estimated equivalent examples provided below. Equivalent Instructional Activities contribute toward the total number of learning hours by using the following examples:  • Exact Equivalent (1:1, i.e. one learning or contact hour for every hour spent) • Face-to-face or live synchronous sessions, such as classroom or web-based lectures or class sessions, real-time chat sessions, or conference calls • Other live ‘classroom’ time (i.e. internships or practica, guided field experiences [museum or facility tours], studio work, virtual or at-home labs for chemistry/biology, service projects, etc.) • Videos, audio recordings, recorded lectures or webinars, or timed animations/simulations/demonstrations • Student presentations via web conferencing • Proctored exams or quizzes  ESTIMATED EQUIVALENT   • LMS/module pages (estimated number of words at average adult reading rate) • Learning assets such as assigned reading, digital mini-books, articles, simulations, self-paced modules, case studies, etc. (calculated average time needed to ‘consume’ the material assuming the student reads 10 to 15 pages per hour. Time may vary by department.) • Instructor-facilitated or instructor-feedback-rich activities such as discussion boards, wikis, journals, group projects (instructor expectation of time to be spent) • Student presentations via virtual poster session (instructor expectation of time spent reviewing and commenting on ‘posters’ or presentation) • Instructor-guided research activities (instructor expectation of time to be spent) • Low-stakes quizzes used as comprehension checkers (instructor estimation of time spent) • Preparation for examinations (instructor estimation of time to be spent) • Discussion question preparation (instructor estimation of time spent) • Homework/Working Problems time (instructor estimation of time to be spent)  ACCEPTABLE RANGES OF STUDENT LEARNING HOURS   Given the diversity of course offerings and delivery and instructional formats, calculating student learning hours requires flexibility. Because of this, the following chart was devised to provide a foundation for calculating student learning hours.  Equivalent Instructional Activities helps to supplement time when courses do not meet the traditional (45 total learning hours, 15 hours for every 1 credit earned).  • Credit Value of Course 4    Target Number of Student Learning Hours 180 • Credit Value of Course 3    Target Number of Student Learning Hours *135 • Credit Value of Course 2    Target Number of Student Learning Hours 90  *Example represents a traditional course meeting for 45 contact hours with 90 hours of out of class academic engagement. This follows the federal guideline for every one hour in class the student will have two hours of work outside the classroom.  For courses with abbreviated contact hours, the out of class academic engagement will be supplemented via Equivalent Instructional Activities.      54 GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS  CARLOW COMPASS CURRICULUM OVERVIEW   The Carlow Compass is a unique and innovative general education curriculum rooted in the liberal arts and the Catholic Intellectual Tradition, and is intended to serve as a navigational tool to help guide a student toward her/his academic and professional goals.

A Philosophy minor can be obtained by completing at least 15 credits (five courses) in the field of philosophy. Philosophy minors should meet with the members of the Philosophy Department about which courses would be most appropriate for their degree.  THEOLOGY MINOR   Theology is a scholarly study of the mystery of human existence and the interdependence of women and men as they relate to God. Theology examines the human experiences that have given rise to questions of religion such as the meaning of life and death, the existence of a personal God, the search for human values, issues of peace and justice, contemporary spirituality, and ministry of the laity. These questions have no answers. Rather, they invite inquiry into reality in a unique way by engaging one in reflection that yearns for Sabbath, i.e. sacred time set aside to ponder the depth of the richness and wisdom of God in human beings, in human history, and in all of creation. Following upon this, it seems that the theology student comes to this discipline already with a prerequisite: the desire to rest in the depths of holy mystery. The theology minor provides the discipline necessary for this unique way of inquiry through a sequence of courses in scriptural, historical, systematic, and moral theology, and pastoral ministry.  The Theology minor is a perfect augment to many majors. Students majoring in the Social Sciences, Education or Nursing have found that theological studies can provide a greater depth as to how and why we care about the many issues in society, education and health care. Students in the empirical sciences can be enriched by Theology's encompassing  79 approach to the natural world as a window that reveals the presence of divine activity in the cosmos. Finally, students who choose Liberal Studies as a major will find the Theology minor to be an exciting complement to their other minors.  Students who minor in Theology must take 18 credits in the department including  Introduction to Linguistics   This course provides an introduction to the study of language from structural, historical, social, and psychological perspectives. Language acquisition, its systematic nature (phonology, morphology, and syntax), and its social and geographic variations are elements of the course. 3 credits  "

Students who combine an English major with a major in another discipline must fulfill a minimum of 26 to 27 credits in English.  75 ENGLISH MINOR   Students who minor in English must take a minimum of 18 credits in English. The student and faculty advisor will design the program that best suits the student’s needs. English minors have opportunities to explore literature that intrigues them, through topics as diverse as crime fiction, Irish literature, and environmental justice literature.  THEATRE MINOR   The Theatre minor requires a minimum of 18 credits including  Shakespeare   This course focuses on William Shakespeare’s comedies, tragedies, histories, and romances, read within cultural and generic contexts. Students analyze the plays’ complex depictions of gender norms, race, politics, family dysfunction, and other controversial topics, as they were understood during the Renaissance and are relevant for today. The course includes viewing of film adaptations and (when possible) live performances. 3 credits  FULFILLS LITERARY ARTS LAI REQUIREMENT.   "

WOMEN’S AND GENDER STUDIES PROGRAM   Women’s and Gender Studies courses look at contemporary and historical research about and creative productions by women; raise new questions which are relevant to women in global cultures; question sex role relationships and basic social assumptions regarding women’s roles; and encourage students and faculty to do research and creative productions about gender issues. Women’s and Gender Studies incorporate interdisciplinary concepts and methods and question masculine biases across the disciplines. Courses explore the historical condition of women, the interpretation of women in the various disciplines, and the present and future position of women in society. The program fosters new scholarship in order to understand the cultural history of gendered experiences as well as to debate gendered situations today.   WOMEN’S AND GENDER STUDIES MINOR   Requirements:   The Women’s and Gender Studies program offers an introductory course, a course in feminist theory, and a course in global perspectives. Students who would like to minor in Women’s and Gender Studies should first enroll in level-one courses, in the order in which they appear below, before moving on to level-two courses, which are cross-listed in various departments and programs. The Women’s and Gender Studies program requests that the two cross-listed courses not be from the same discipline/department and that the student also complete one Women’s and Gender Studies elective. Under this structure, the total credits needed for the minor in Women’s and Gender Studies is 18.   LEVEL 1  Required Core Women’s and Gender Studies Courses:   •  Acting   An introduction to the conventions and methods of the actor’s art, which provides a basis for both the beginning actor and students who wish to increase their appreciation of stage performance. 3 credits   "

The student fulfills the specified core required of all  Carlow University students but enjoys a maximum degree of flexibility in choosing the remaining courses. It is a viable option for the student with varied interests who wishes, for example, to study the plays of Shakespeare in one course, pursue the theories of economics in another, and focus on biblical interpretation in yet another. A required concentration in one area of study assures that the student will reach a level of progressive depth in a single discipline of his/her choice. This is also an excellent program for a student who is currently employed but can advance further in the workplace with a university degree. With the help of an advisor, the student can creatively shape the direction of studies in light of personal and professional goals. This program will be particularly beneficial to students who have decided to exit their original major but who still desire to graduate in a timely manner.  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS  • Students must successfully achieve 120 credits in order to graduate. A minimum 2.0 grade point average  is required. • All students must fulfill the requirements of the Carlow Compass. • In addition to the Carlow Compass, each student must choose one area of concentration, taking a minimum of  12 credits in one discipline. At least two of those courses must be at the 200 level or higher. • In the last semester, the student will produce a thesis or project that demonstrates integrative thinking and proficiency of the Program of Study outcomes. This will be chosen and completed under the direction of the program advisor. • The remaining credits needed to reach 120 will be considered electives chosen at the discretion of the student in conjunction with the advisor.  HISTORY MAJOR   The study of history and the skills developed in writing history provide a sound basis for positioning students in the increasingly competitive job markets of today and tomorrow, for their formal and informal education later in their lives, as well as during their college years. A major in History is one of the best foundations for success in career and academic plans. Knowledge of history is essential for success in a rapidly changing world. Understanding humanity’s recorded experience gives students the information and perspective they need in order to be able to think in an orderly way about the world: its economics, politics, cultures, legal systems, and religions. History also provides students with a context for better understanding and enjoying literature, music, and the arts, all of which are in part reflections of the times in which they were produced. Equally important are the skills in research and writing developed in the course of historical study. These skills are readily transferable to everyday life, future scholarship, and a career. The quality performance of History majors in law, business, education, government, journalism, television and radio, and the arts has long been recognized. A major in History is a good preparation for graduate study in History or other humanities.   The History major program can be combined with virtually any minor program at Carlow. History is also an ideal second major augmenting the advantages of almost any field of study.   Graduates from Carlow with a degree in History should:   • Exhibit in-depth knowledge in a specialty area coupled with a broad familiarity with other histories, Western and/or non-Western, and a solid foundation in methodology;  • Produce scholarship sensitized to the issues of class, race, gender, and sexual orientation, manifestly utilizing cross-cultural and transnational perspectives, leadership issues, and peace and justice considerations;  • Demonstrate familiarity with current concerns and debates within historiography, and the social and cultural significance of these debates;   77 • Show knowledge and versatility adequate for entrance to and successful completion of an MA and/or PhD program in history or another superior degree in other related graduate programs, or to pursue a career in journalism, the media, or the arts upon graduation.   MAJOR REQUIREMENTS: 33 credits  Required Courses (18 credits)   Feminist Theories   This course introduces students to a variety of theories that address the imbalance of power between men and women and the oppression and discrimination that result. Through a focus on feminist theories on gender as a central element of power, students become familiar with the field of feminist scholarship on women and gender. The course also introduces students to the intersections among gender, race, class, and sexuality in the lives and writings of diverse women. Upon completion of this course, students will understand a variety of feminist theories, including the theory of gender, race, class, and sexuality as interlinked, as well as the principles informing women’s activism. 3 credits  FULFILLS WOMEN’S STUDIES LAI AND GLOBAL REQUIREMENTS.

The student and faculty member will design the program that best suits the student’s needs.  LIBERAL STUDIES MAJOR   A Bachelor of Arts in Liberal Studies provides an ideal major for the creative, independent student who is interested in an interdisciplinary focus. This major takes on the characteristics of a “guided studies” or “directed studies” program whereby the student, working closely with the program advisor, has the opportunity to “create a major” according to personal education and career goals.  This major further allows the student to gain significant depth in three areas of study and, at the same time, to acquire the breadth that is characteristic of a liberal arts education.  While a degree in Liberal Studies is a very practical degree in itself, this major is also an ideal preparation for students who are planning to pursue studies beyond the bachelor degree level.  It is especially practical for students who have particular career goals that require in-depth study in more than one academic area. It is an individually designed program of study whereby students choose three minors. At least two minors must be from any of the liberal arts programs such as those found in the humanities, art, the sciences, English, Women’s Studies, and the social sciences.  Students may choose one minor in an area outside of the liberal arts programs—Accounting, Business Management, Human Resources, Information Technology, or Health Coach minor.   Program Requirements:  • Total Program Required Credits Minimum 54 credits. The required number of credits for each minor and the particular sequence of courses are determined by the academic program offering the minor. • Three Minors in Separate Programs of Study The three minors constitute the minimum 54-credit requirement. Two of the chosen minors must be in Liberal Arts programs; one minor may be in a Professional Studies program (i.e. Accounting, Business Management, Human Resources, Information Technology or Nursing), or all three may be in a Liberal Arts program. • Liberal Studies Thesis During the senior year, the student will produce a senior project that reflects the learning outcomes of the program. While this project will be created in conjunction with the program advisor, the student will be free to choose a project faculty director from any of the chosen minor fields. • Carlow Compass Any of the Carlow Compass courses can be counted toward the minors where applicable, as well as to the Liberal Studies major as a whole.  MATHEMATICS MAJOR   The curriculum in Mathematics provides the knowledge and experience needed to be a professional mathematician or pursue advanced study in a related area. The courses provide a balance between applied and theoretical problem solving, while the Junior Seminar and Senior Experience allow an in-depth exploration of an area beyond the formal course work. The design of the major provides ample opportunity to pursue a minor in another academic discipline, to expand potential career opportunities,   78 or to prepare for law school. Students completing the major in Mathematics will have satisfied content area requirements for Pennsylvania secondary certification in mathematics.   Requirements for Bachelor of Science in Mathematics:   Mathematics majors are required to complete:  Senior Thesis   During this capstone experience, students pursue challenging independent scholarship that demonstrates depth and breadth of historical knowledge.

SOCIAL CHANGE CURRICULUM   OVERVIEW  The social change curriculum draws from the academic disciplines in the College of Leadership and Social Change: communication management, political science, psychology, social work, and sociology that employ a social scientific approach to the study of human behavior. The curriculum provides an array of academic and co-curricular experiences that are embedded designed to increase students’ civic engagement and enhance their psychosocial development, with the goal of moving students into positions as change agents in service to organizations and communities from local to global.  This undergraduate program is grounded within Carlow University’s liberal arts tradition, and infused in the disciplines. The pillars of the program are: academics, advocacy, civic engagement, and experiential learning. The classroom experience is augmented by internships and programming, which allows students to participate in applied social science opportunities. This program is responsive to the Mercy mission of social justice and includes the study of empowerment: empowering students to empower others. Students are encouraged to view themselves as scholars, citizens, and leaders. As students move from introductory courses to becoming members of communities of practice, they see themselves both as part of the existing process and as agents of change.  The curriculum builds students’ aptitudes in the disciplines and across the liberal arts. The program is designed to allow students to move from competency in the introductory level courses; to proficiency in the upper level courses in the disciplines; to mastery as the students develop and present their own scholarship; and finally to entry into communities of practice. In the first two years of study, students complete three seminars, in addition to discipline-specific courses, designed to introduce them to the theories and tools involved in the study of the social sciences:  •  Social Work with Families   An enhancement of the application of knowledge and skills of generalist social work practice designed to enhance the skills introduced in , AND "

Every interaction, every lab result, x-ray, diagnostic, prescription, diagnosis, or procedure is collected and kept safe and secure, available to you and your providers to establish a cogent medical history to better serve you. But that information can also do so much more.  It’s up to the Health Information Management and Analytics specialists to use – and protect – that date in meaningful ways. It’s a discipline that combines medicine, business, and information.  Medicine: One way a Health Information Manager or Analyst can use data is predictive: does your health history indicate an increased chance of something more serious? Maybe a treatment successfully used on other patients would work on your chronic condition, too. As patients continue along on whatever paths through the healthcare system, the valuable data they create can be used, anonymously, to assist in finding larger trends in the ever-changing health landscape.  Business: These trends don’t just matter to the patients affected by them – they matter to the providers and insurers, too. Health data is used to make business function better, to streamline information-gathering technologies, to simplify and secure the health records themselves, or to connect better treatments to more cost-effective practices. A Health Information Manager or Analyst is also a business specialist.  Information: Data protection is more and more important with each passing day, and Health Information professionals are at the front lines of the battle against leaks, hacks, and information mismanagement. They’re the people developing and implementing the best practices in keeping patient data safe, secure, and easily accessible.  LEARNING OUTCOMES  Through the very dynamic Health Information Management and Analytics {HIMA) curriculum, students will gain a great level of understanding of the healthcare field, with special focus on the analytical review and use of data in other business areas. This broad, well-rounded understanding of the industry will provide the students with many opportunities in todays' and future job markets. At a high level, HIMA students are expected to demonstrate proficiency in the following learning areas upon completion of the academic program:  • Applied learning is used by students to demonstrate what they can do with what they know. This is especially critical to the HIMA field of study. • Intellectual skills are used by students to think critically and analytically about what they learn, broadening their individual perspectives and experiences. • Specialized knowledge is the knowledge students demonstrate about the HIMA field of study, understanding the relevant current issues professionals are addressing today. • Broad knowledge of the HIMA field that transcends the typical boundaries of students in the first two years of higher education. This extensive level of understanding of the industry, as well as knowledge gained through the Carlow Compass, will build the foundation for moving into the business sector. • HIMA students will be a part of civic learning, which enables them to respond to social, environmental, and economic challenges at local, national, and global levels. • All HIMA students will achieve a high level of digital information literacy. This will equip students with the understanding to manage and analyze data in a responsible, safe, ethical, and effective manner. This includes using current tools, technologies, techniques, and best practices to support industry, facilitate research and solve real world problems.   187 HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND ANALYTICS PROGRAM POLICIES   Health Information Management and Analytics (HIMA) policies are explained fully in the HIMA Program Student Handbook.
