What can you expect from earning a Caldwell Universitydiploma? Let me address this question first with some national statistics about the value of auniversity degree and then tell you more specifically about the type of education that Caldwelloffers our students.Students who graduate with a bachelor’s degree can expect to make between $500,000 and$1,000,000 more than their counterparts who have not graduated with a four-year degree.In addition to this substantial increase in earnings, college graduates are more likely to beemployed, to be working full time and to be employed in an area that interests and engagesthem. Furthermore, college graduates are more civically engaged, being more likely to voteand also to engage in volunteer and service activities. Finally, those with a college degree tendto live healthier lifestyles. For all of these reasons, completing a college education is an important goal for you to set and to achieve in the next four years.At Caldwell, you will have an opportunity to receive an excellent education in classes taughtby full-time faculty members who are committed to our Catholic identity and Dominican heritage.

Caldwell University has always been a community focused on students, and for that reason,the student-faculty ratio is kept low at 13:1 so that faculty members can engage students one-on-one during class and are accessible to students outside the classroom. Support serviceson campus, including a well-staffed Academic Success Center and our student-friendly library,exist to provide students with resources and assistance throughout their university careers. The campus atmosphere is vibrant. With a record number of students living on campus, thereare ample and varied evening and weekend activities to attract students when they are not inclass. Caldwell is home to 15 Division II athletic teams and offers a strong recreational sportsand fitness program for non-athletes. Students can participate in more than two dozen activeclubs and organizations or start one of their own if they so choose. Many students decide tovolunteer for campus ministry activities that allow students to bring food and clothing to thehomeless in New York City, to tutor inner city youth, to build homes in Appalachia or travel toCentral America to assist those who are less fortunate.If you are interested in achieving a bachelor’s degree while experiencing opportunities for personal growth and leadership development, then Caldwell University is the ideal campus foryou.

Blattner, Ph.D., OPAPresident INTRODUCTION4INTRODUCTIONMission StatementFounded in 1939 by the Sisters of Saint Dominic, Caldwell University promotes intellectual, spiritual, and aesthetic growth to a diverse population and welcomes all cultures and faith traditions. Inspired by St. Dominic de Guzman and our Catholic heritage, we transform students’ lives by preparing them through the liberal arts and professional studies to think critically, pursue truth, and contribute to a just society.OriginsAs one of the youngest of the many Dominican colleges and universities throughout the world,Caldwell University is intimately linked to the 800-year history and spirit of the DominicanOrder, a worldwide community of preachers, scholars, and educators that traces its origins tothe thirteenth century. This Order had its beginnings in an age not unlike the present day, atime of unrest and transition in the social, economic, moral and intellectual sphere. Dedicated to the pursuit of truth, the Order has found itself since its inception at the heart of higher education and its climate of study and prayer has produced such scholars as Thomas Aquinas,social reformers like Catherine of Siena, artists like Fra Angelico, and scientists like Albert the Great. This inherited integration of the arts, humanities and sciences with the deepestexpression of the contemplative and creative spirit of men and women forms the basis of theeducational philosophy of Caldwell University.We celebrate our origins by Liturgy and through convocations, a campus-wide commitment to religious belief, and by witness to the university motto: “Sapientia et Scientia.”History and AccreditationCaldwell University was founded as Caldwell College, a Catholic liberal arts college, by theSisters of Saint Dominic under the leadership of Mother M. Joseph Dunn, O.P., and with theapproval of the Most Reverend Thomas Joseph Walsh, Archbishop of Newark, who becameits first president. Nancy H.

The lender isthe institution from which the money is actually borrowed. All lenders are not the same. It paysto make an informed decision when selecting a lender. You will be entering in a long-term relationship with the institution. Reasons for selecting a particular lender vary fromFINANCIAL AID18person to person. Some choose based on name or brand recognition or reputation. Othersprefer the immediate benefit of below-market processing fees. Still others are interested in borrower benefits in repayment, like an interest rate reduction as a reward for making consecutive on-time payments. We encourage families to use the lender and the loan productthat best meets their needs.Federal Loan ConsolidationStudents entering repayment may consolidate their loans. Programs that may be consideredfor consolidation are:Federal Stafford LoansFederal PLUS LoansThe Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is determined by calculating the “weighted average” of theinterest rates of your consolidation loans.

The calculations varied according tothe student’s status, first-time student or continuing student. There was considerable confusionin the financial aid community with regard to the amount that the institution would be eligibleto retain and that a student would be required to “repay” if he or she withdrew from a semester. The 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1964 simplified this calcu-lation by replacing the current calculations with a single pro rata formula. It also shifted thefocus from institution to the student. The student is only eligible for the amount that is earnedat the time he or she ceases attendance. It no longer has a relationship to the student’s institu-tional charges.EFFECTIVE FOR PERIODS OF ENROLLMENT BEGINNING ON OR AFTER 8/28/2000The policy shall apply to all students who withdraw, drop out or are expelled from CaldwellUniversity and receive financial aid from Title IV Funds:1.The term “Title IV Funds” refers to the Federal financial aid programs authorized under theHigher Education Act of 1965 (as amended) and includes the following programs:a.Unsubsidized FFEL/Direct loans, subsidized FFEL/Direct loans, Federal Pell Grants,Federal SEOG.2.A student’s withdrawal date is:a.The date the student began the institution’s withdrawal process or officially notified theinstitution of intent to withdraw; orb.The midpoint of the period for a student who leaves unofficially without notifying the institution; orc.The student’s last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity.3.Refunds on all institutional charges, including tuition and fees, will be calculated using theCaldwell University refund policy published in the Catalogand class schedule and will be calculated and determined by the Bursars Office.4.Title IV aid is earned in a prorated manner on a per diem basis up to and including the 60%point in the semester. 60% is approximately 9.6 weeks of a 16-week semester or 4.8 weeksof an 8-week summer session. Title IV aid and all other aid is viewed as 100% earned afterthat point in time. 5.The percentage of Title IV aid earned shall be calculated as follows:a.Number of days completed by student ÷ Total number of days in term* = Percent of term completed.b.The percent of term completed shall be the percentage of Title IV aid earned by the student.c.The total number of calendar days in a term of enrollment shall exclude any scheduledbreaks of more than five days.*6.The percentage of Title IV aid unearned (i/e., to be returned to the appropriate aid pro-gram) shall be 100% minus the percent earned.7.Unearned aid shall be returned first from the student’s account calculated as follows:a.Total institutional charges (x) percent of unearned aid = amount returned to programs.b.Unearned Title IV aid shall be returned to the following programs in the following order:• Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan• Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan• Federal Pell Grant• Federal SEOG Grant• Other Title IV grant programsException: no program can receive a refund if the student did not receive aid from that program.FINANCIAL AID228.When the total amount of unearned aid is greater than the amount returned from the student’s account, the student is responsible for returning unearned aid to the appropriateprograms(s) as follows:a.Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan*b.Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan*c.Federal Pell Grant**d.Federal SEOG Grant**e.Other Title IV grant programs** *Loan amounts are returned in accordance with the terms of the promissory note signed by the student.**Amounts to be returned by the student to federal grant programs will receive a 50% discount. Return of Title IV Funds PolicyThe following procedures should be followed when the Office of Financial Aid receives notifi-cation that a student, who is receiving financial aid, has withdrawn from the university.•Official Withdrawal: Caldwell University will apply the official withdrawal date asrecorded by the Office of the Registrar in determining the return of funds due by the studentand/or institution. Caldwell University will consider the student’s official withdrawal date tobe the date the student submits his/her written withdrawal request, to the Registrar.•Unofficial Withdrawal: Caldwell University will contact the student’s instructors to verifythat the student attended “at least half-time.” If the instructor/s cannot verify the student’sattendance “at least half-time,” the student must return all financial aid funds. If the instruc-tor/s verifies the student did attend “at least half-time,” the Office of Financial Aid will applythe 50% point of the semester to be the withdrawal date. If Caldwell University determinesthat a student did not begin the institution’s withdrawal process or otherwise provide officialnotification (including notice from an individual acting on the student’s behalf) to CaldwellUniversity of his/her intent to withdraw because of illness, accident, grievous personal loss,or other such circumstances beyond the student’s control, Caldwell University may assign awithdrawal date that is related to that circumstance.•Calculations: Caldwell University will use the Return of Financial Aid – Refund Policy federal software program to determine the amount the student and /or institution must refundto the appropriate program. The Office of Financial Aid and Student Accounts will workcooperatively to verify the accuracy of each refund calculation.•Institution’s Return of Funds: Once the institution’s portion of the return of funds hasbeen calculated, the Office of Financial Aid will reduce the student’s original financialaward and return the funds within 30 days to the appropriate program/s in the order spec-ified. If this creates a “charge” on the student’s account in Student Accounts, the student willbe responsible for paying the debt to Student Accounts immediately. The student will not beallowed to register, receive an official transcript, and/or receive future financial aid until thedebt to Caldwell University has been paid in full. •Student’s Return of Funds: Once the student’s portion of the return of funds has beencalculated, the Office of Financial Aid will notify the student of the amount he/she mustrepay. The student may select one of the following repayment options:–The student may pay Caldwell University the full amount of his/her debt, and the university will return the funds to the appropriate programs; or –The student may contact the Department of Education to establish a repayment plan.FINANCIAL AID23The student will remain eligible for Title IV Funds for 45 days from the date the institution sendsa notice to the student of the overpayment. To continue eligibility past 45 days, the studentmust pay the overpayment in full to Caldwell University or make satisfactory arrangements torepay with the Department of Education. On the 46th day, the institution will report the stu-dent’s overpayment to the Department of Education, and if the student must return federal loanfunds, the student’s lender will be notified of the amount owed by the student. The student isresponsible for repayment of any loan debt to his/her lender. •Return of Unearned Funds: Unearned funds must be returned in the following order:Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan, Subsidized Federal PLUS Loan, Federal Pell Grant,Federal SEOG, other grant, scholarship, or loan assistance. If there is a return for a loanfund that was originally received by EFT, the Office of Financial Aid will be responsible forthe return of these funds. If the loan funds were originally received by “paper check” fromthe lender, Student Accounts will be responsible for return of these funds to the lender. •Post-Withdrawal Funds: If the amount disbursed to the student is less than the amountthe student earned, the amount is considered to be post-withdrawal disbursement. Post-withdrawal eligibility can be used to credit outstanding charges on the student’s tuitionaccount. Caldwell University has 30 days, from the date of the institution’s determination thatthestudent withdrew, to offer any amount of the post-withdrawal disbursement to the student(or parent for PLUS loans). The student (or parent) may accept or decline some or all of thepost-withdrawal disbursement that is not credited to the student’s account.

If after 3 attempts without passing, a studentmust obtain written permission from their Department Chair or Associate Dean to repeat the course.When a course is repeated, the higher grade will be used in determining the cumulative GradePoint Average. Both grades, however, are shown/recorded on the transcript.TutorialsWhen a course which a student needs to complete degree requirements is genuinelyunavailable,(i.e., a legitimate academic or personal problem has prevented the student from taking a regularly scheduled course) permission may be granted to take it as a tutorial. Applications,ACADEMIC POLICIES53which may be obtained from the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services, requirethe approval of the instructor, the department chair and the academic advisor, and the VicePresident for Academic Affairs.Independent StudyIndependent study courses consist of student-designed, faculty-approved, in-depth programs ofstudy outside of the university’s regular course offerings. Such courses may be pursued only byupper division students with a cumulative index of 3.0 or higher, for a letter grade, after a proposal has been approved by the faculty advisor and the chair of the department of the respective discipline.AttendanceThe faculty have immediate jurisdiction over all student attendance regulation, and therefore theindividual policies identified by the specific faculty member for the course will be the standardfor student attendance in that course. In the absence of such rules, the policy below will apply.Regular and punctual attendance is an essential part of the educational program. Students areexpected to be earnest about their scholastic work and to be absent only for serious reasons.Each instructor determines the course attendance policy and students should receive a policystatement at the beginning of the course in the syllabus. Students are expected to attend eachclass session in accordance with each instructor’s or department’s attendance policy.

It is expressed in terms of the scholastic index also known as the GradePoint Average (GPA). The scholastic index is computed by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of semester hours attempted. For example, a studentwho has earned 30 quality points for 15 semester hours has a scholastic index of 2.0. Onlycourse work taken at Caldwell University or in an approved affiliation program is included inthe computation of the GPA.Quality points are the numerical values assigned to the various grades as shown in the following table. For example, the grade “A” translates into 4 quality points per semester hour.The cumulative index will determine the academic standing of a student at every point. A student is in good academic standing if the cumulative index is 1.8 at the end of the first semester and 2.0 at the end of every semester thereafter.GRADEQUALITY POINTSINTERPRETATIONA4.0Highest level of achievementA-3.75Exemplary achievementB+3.5Consistently superior achievementB3.0Very goodB-2.75GoodC+2.5Above averageC2.0Satisfactory work.

The maintenance of a minimum GPA of 1.8 during any one semester, a minimum cumula-tive average of 2.0 after two semesters, and a minimum of 2.0 in major courses duringthe junior and senior years.4. Students who have not accumulated the minimum credits and/or the minimum cumulative average at the end of each academic year will be evaluated by the VicePresident for Academic Affairs to determine if the student has the potential to completethe degree requirements within the maximum years allowed. A positive determinationwill indicate satisfactory progress.The progress of part-time students (defined as students taking fewer than 12 credits in a semester) will be periodically reviewed by the Center for Advising, Records and EnrollmentServices. Ordinarily, a student should be able to attain a degree within a maximum of ten aca-demic years. After ten years, a re-evaluation of the student’s record will be necessary. Studentswho take more than ten years to complete a degree run the risk of having to repeat or addcourses in the major field in order to keep their education current.A student who has been academically dismissed and then reinstated must show evidence ofimproved academic progress since dismissal in order to receive financial aid.Students will not be funded with any financial aid past completion of 150% of their educationaldegree requirement (i.e., 120 credits to graduate cannot exceed 180 credits).Class StandingTo be classified as a sophomore, a student must have earned at least 30 credit hours; as a junior, the student must have earned at least 60 credit hours; as a senior, at least 90 credit hours.ACADEMIC POLICIES56Grade ReportsAt the close of each semester, grade reports will be available online.

An attempt must be made to resolve the matter in a face-to-face meet-ing with the faculty member. If the student believes that the situation has not been resolved, thestudent may meet with the Department Chair (or the Vice President for Academic Affairs if thefaculty member is also the Department Chair.) If the student continues to believe that the resolu-tion is not satisfactory, he/she may appeal in writingto the Vice President for Academic Affairsusing the designated Student Appeal form on the Caldwell Portal. The appeal will then be heardby the Academic Foundations Committee which may request oral testimony from the partiesinvolved. The final decision will then be made by the faculty members of the AcademicFoundations Committee. If the faculty member is not available to participate in the appealprocess, the department chair shall act as surrogate for the faculty member in the appeal process.At all times, the burden of proof is on the student to demonstrate that the final grade does notaccurately reflect the student’s performance in the course.When supported by sufficient evidence, any of the following reasonsmay constitute cause for challenging a final grade:1. The grade was the result of an error on the part of the instructor in calculating, recording, or reporting a final grade.2. The grade was awarded in an arbitrary or capricious manner.3. The grade was the result of unfair discrimination. The student must provide evidence thatthe instructor did not apply a consistent grading standard to all students in the course.None of the following shall be considered cause for appealing a final grade:1. Disagreement with the course requirements established by the professor.2. Disagreement with the grading standards established by the professor.3. Disagreement with the instructor’s judgment when applying grading standards, assuming that the instructor has made a reasonable effort to be fair and consistent inexercising that judgment.4. The desire or need of the student to attain a particular grade.5. Consequences that a student might face as the result of a grade award.An appeal of a final grade must be made within four months of the posting of the initial grade. *Adapted from Shepherd University.ACADEMIC POLICIES57Academic RecoveryAcademic Standing Summary:•Good Academic Standing: Cumulative and major GPA is 2.0 or above.•Academic Warning: Any student whose term GPA is below a 2.0.•Academic Probation: Any student whose cumulative GPA falls below a 2.0–Re-admit Probation: Returning students who have a cumulative GPA below 2.0–Continued Probation:Second semester probation students whose GPA remains below2.0 but have shown improvement by raising their cumulative GPA or achieve a term GPAof 2.0 or above.•Academic Suspension:Any student who has failed to improve cumulative GPA or who hasnot achieve a term GPA of 2.0 or above after one semester on Academic Probation. •Academic Dismissal: Any student who has failed to improve cumulative GPA after returningfrom Academic suspension and has put little to no effort in achieving academic goals willface academic dismissal from the University.

A student who has been dismissed a second time may not apply for reinstatement.Withdrawal from the UniversityTraditional students who withdraw from the university are required to meet with the Director ofAdvising an exit interview and follow established proceduresfor remaining in good academicstanding. If a student withdraws from the university during a semester, the student must alsowithdraw from all courses. Failure to follow this procedure will result in a grade of F in everycourse for which the student was registered.Interruptions of RegistrationTraditional students are normally expected to register for courses every semester until completion of degree requirements. Students wishing to interrupt their registration, for any reason, should apply to the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services for a leave ofabsence. The Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services will advise them concerning: re-registration at the university after the leave of absence; transfer of any credits earned at other insti-ACADEMIC POLICIES59tutions during the leave of absence; and completion of degree requirements within the six-year periodstipulated under Academic Progress above. Any student who has received financial aid at CaldwellUniversity should contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine the impact of this leave of absence.Students who interrupt their registration without having an approved leave of absence mustapply to the Center for Advising, Records and Enrollment Services in order to re-register at theuniversity. A student whose registration at the university has been interrupted for a period offive years or longer will, upon re-entry, be obligated by the current catalog requirements. Thestudent’s transcript will also need to be re-evaluated by the department chair in order to deter-mine the viability of credits earned toward the major.Students who take more than 10 years to graduate also need to have courses in their major re-evaluated.Courses at Other InstitutionsStudents who have declared a major and have completed a minimum of 15 degree credits atCaldwell University with a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 or 2.75 for Nursing and Educationmajors, may request permission to take a course at another approved institution.

The natureand mission of Caldwell University demand a high respect for moral values, including intellectual honesty and justice. Every student who attends Caldwell University agrees to abideby this Academic Integrity Policy as long as he or she remains enrolled. Students who witnessviolations are strongly encouraged to report the academic dishonesty to the appropriate academic authority (instructor, chair or Vice President for Academic Affairs.)ACADEMIC POLICIES60The following is an explanation of violations, penalties and procedures regarding academic dishonesty:VIOLATIONS OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITYAcademic dishonesty includes but is not necessarily limited to the following:Cheating1. Unauthorized use of materials during tests and examinations.2. Unauthorized possession of test or examination material prior to the administration of same.3. Altering assigned grades.4. Submitting, as one’s own work, assignments (for example, papers, data, computerassignments, or artistic works) obtained in whole or in part from another, unless specifically authorized to do so by the instructor.FabricatingInventing data or other information to reach a desired conclusion.PlagiarismThe unacknowledged, undocumented presentation of words or ideas which are the intellectual property of another as one’s own.1. Direct quotation, that is, even a few of the exact words of a source, must be indicatedby the use of quotation marks or indentation of the text and be properly documented.2. Passages which parallel the thought or expression of the source, even without usingthe same words, must be properly documented.Multiple SubmissionAssignments, substantially the same as those submitted for credit in another course, maynot be resubmitted in a second course without the explicit authorization of that instructor.InterferenceBehavior deliberately calculated to prevent or impede another student from fulfilling his orher academic responsibilities.ComplicityAssisting another student in violating Academic Integrity by any of the actions describedin this document.Charges and Appealing ChargesIf a faculty member determines that a violation of academic integrity has occurred, he/shemust confront the student and report the incident to the faculty member’s department chair andto the Vice President for Academic Affairs.The student charged with academic dishonesty may appeal the charge to the chair of thedepartment in which the incident occurred, or the Vice President for Academic Affairs if thefaculty member is also the department chair. The department chair or the Vice President forAcademic Affairs if the faculty member is also the department chair, will investigate the factsand affirm or dismiss the charge. Subsequently, the student may register a formal appeal with the Vice President for AcademicAffairs via the Student Appeal form on the Caldwell portal, who will convene the AcademicAppeals Board. The Board consists of a designated Chair, the chair of the department of theACADEMIC POLICIES61faculty member involved in the appeal, one member of the Academic Foundations Committee,the Vice President for Student Life, and either an SGA officer or faculty member or administra-tor of the student’s choice. If the Board determines that an appeal is warranted, it will invitetestimony from both the student and faculty member involved in the incident and, at its discre-tion, may solicit other pertinent information. The Vice President for Academic Affairs and theBoard are responsible for ensuring that the appeals process is correctly followed and that allevidence has been thoroughly examined. The Board’s decision is final.Penalties and Appealing PenaltiesOffenses against the Academic Integrity Policy are cumulative within the university. A recordof each violation will be kept in the student’s file. Prior offenses will be taken into account inthe assignment of penalties for violations of the policy. Faculty have the right to includeoffenses and penalties in the course syllabus that may go beyond the stated standard.Following are the penalties to be imposed on students for violation of the Academic Integrity Policy.FIRST OFFENSE(no record of prior offense within the university)• The student will be assigned a grade of F/no credit for the assignment or examination.• For offenses such as interference, when the student may not be enrolled in the course,the offense will be recorded in the student’s file.MULTIPLE OFFENSES(prior offense has been reported and is part of the student’s record/or multiple offenses are reported simultaneously)• The student will be given an FX grade in the course indicating failure due to a violationof the university’s academic integrity policy.MORE SEVERE PENALTIES• The university reserves the right to impose more severe penalties, including suspensionfor a designated period of time or expulsion from the university, for multiple offensesand/or other factors that may compound the offense.• For offenses where the student is not enrolled in the course, the university reserves the right to impose other penalties including, but not limited to, suspension for a designated period of time or expulsion from the university.A student will not be allowed to withdraw from a course in which there is a charge of violating the university’s policy on Academic Integrity.The Vice President for Academic Affairs is responsible for maintaining the necessaryrecords and ensuring that the penalties for multiple offenses are appropriately administered.In such cases where the more severe penalties of suspension or expulsion are imposed,the student may appeal to the Academic Foundations Committee. The Committee will thenmake a final decision on the penalty. If a student is expelled at any point during a semester/session, due to a violation(s) of the university’s Academic Integrity Policy, the student willreceive an FX grade(s) in the course(s) where the violation(s) occurred and will receive agrade of W in all other courses taken in that semester/session.ACADEMIC POLICIES62Notification of Rights Under FERPAThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain rightswith respect to their education records.

The outcomes assessment process is designed to demonstrate student ability to useappropriate sources, to understand historical interpretation, to research effectively, to organ-ize a large body of information in a meaningful way, to write clearly, to revise written workbased on faculty input, and to discuss research results comfortably and intelligently before awider audience. In keeping with standard university policy, all majors must earn a final gradeof C or better in both the senior seminar and in HI/. If a student receives a grade ofC or better in HI/ but fails to achieve that grade in their senior seminar then the stu-dent will need to take another senior seminar in order to complete major requirements. Should a student receive a C or better in their senior seminar but fail to achievethat grade in HI/ the student will be offered the opportunity to take an incomplete forthe course so that they can continue to work on their research project until it is of sufficientquality. Results of the process each year are used to improve the department curriculum andstrengthen course requirements, especially in the area of student research and writing.MinorsThe department offers minors in Historyand Political Science, and Pre-Law (see underInterdisciplinary minors): A minor consists of any six department courses chosen from the spe-cific discipline.

The Department meets these goals through ourcourses in social science research methods, criminology, and sociological theory. Methods ofSocial Research I and II are required for both sociology and criminal justice majors, whileSociological Theory is required of sociology majors and Criminology is required of criminaljustice majors. After completing the required outcomes assessment courses, sociology andcriminal justice majors should be able to:1.describe and apply classical and contemporary theories in at least one area of socialreality;2.describe and evaluate classical and contemporary theories of crime causation and applythese theories to real world phenomena;3.identify basic methodological approaches and describe the general role of methods inbuilding sociological knowledge; 4.design a research study in an area of choice;5.develop proficiency in use of statistics for the comprehensive understanding of profes-sional journals;6.apply statistical skills to conduct data analysis using secondary data.SOCIOLOGY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE195In each of the required theory and research courses, the instructor of the outcomes assessmentcourse is responsible for awarding student grades; however, outcomes assessment is theshared responsibility of all full-time department faculty. It is at the discretion of the individualinstructor whether or not to consider departmental faculty evaluations of student work in theircourses when awarding student grades for the course.For sociology majors, departmental faculty will review and evaluate the research paper submitted in Sociological Theory and the final paper submitted for Methods of Social ResearchII. For criminal justice majors, departmental faculty will critique and assess the research papersubmitted in Criminology and the final paper submitted for Methods of Social Research II. Forstudents majoring in both sociology and criminal justice, three evaluations will be done bydepartmental faculty: the research paper for Sociological Theory, Criminology, and Methodsof Social Research II.For a student to pass his/her outcomes assessment requirement, a majority of the departmental faculty must agree that the quality of the work done for bothcourses demonstrates competence. If a student fails to meet the necessary criteria for any of their outcomes assessment paper requirements, the student may: (1) revise the written work, submita new paper for consideration prior to the end of the semester during which the student isenrolled in the course, and give an oral presentation of the paper before the department faculty reviewers; (2) request an Incomplete (in accordance with the Academic Policies setforth in the Caldwell University Undergraduate Catalog), revise the written work, submit a newpaper for consideration within the allotted time period, and give an oral presentation of thepaper before the department faculty reviewers; or (3) repeat the course (in accordance withthe Academic Policies set forth in the Caldwell University Undergraduate Catalog).It is possible that a student may pass his/her outcomes assessment but receive less than a Cgrade for the course in which the outcomes assessment work was done. In such a case, thestudent does not have to go through the outcomes assessment process again; however, thecourse has to be repeated, since students must achieve at least a C grade in all required courses for the major.It is also conceivable that a student may fail the outcomes assessment process, yet achieve aC or better in the course in which the outcomes assessment work was required. In such a case,the student does not have to repeat the course, but must follow guidelines outlined above forstudents who do not pass their outcome assessment requirement.SOCIOLOGY AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE196COURSE DESCRIPTIONSANTHROPOL"
