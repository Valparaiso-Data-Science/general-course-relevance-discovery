Three similar institutions had been established earlier in Oklahoma Territory, which became the western half of the new state.  The six institutions for many years served virtually identical purposes in the state’s program of higher education.  The normal school program consisted of four years of preparatory, or high school, work and two years at the college level.  Graduates of the normal schools were awarded lifetime licenses for teaching in the public schools of the state.  In 1919 the six state normal schools were authorized to increase their college programs to four years of teacher education and to confer bachelors degrees.  At that time they were designated teachers’ colleges.  In 1939 they were authorized to expand their programs to include degree programs in Arts and Sciences as well as Education, and the designation was changed to Oklahoma state colleges.  In 1954 East Central University and the other Oklahoma state colleges were authorized to offer their ﬁ rst graduate work in a ﬁ fth-year program for teachers leading to the Master of Teaching degree.  In 1969 the state colleges were authorized to change the name of this advanced degree from Master of Teaching to Master of Education.  Other masters degrees have since been added.  In 1974 the Oklahoma State Legislature ofﬁ cially changed the name of East Central from East Central State College to East Central Oklahoma State University and in 1985 the ofﬁ cial title became East Central University.  The academic schools of the University are the following:   the Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business; the College of Education and Psychology; the College of Health and Sciences;  the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences; and the School of Graduate Studies.  As a unit in the state’s system of higher education receiving principal support from public taxation, East Central University has sought to serve the needs of the people of the state in a democratically responsive manner.  The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education have speciﬁ ed the following functions for the senior universities of the state.   The functions of the senior universities include:  (1) offering undergraduate study in several ﬁ elds leading to the bachelors degree; (2) offering a limited number of programs leading to the ﬁ rst professional degree when appropriate to an institution’s strengths and the needs of the state; (3) offering graduate study at the masters level, primarily in teacher education and in selected ﬁ elds related to Oklahoma’s human resource needs; (4) responsibility for extension and public service in the assigned geographic regions; (5) responsibility for institutional and applied research in those areas related closely to their program assignments; (6) responsibility for regional programs of economic development; (7) responsibility for offering associate degrees when not in close proximity to a community college; (8) responsibility for offering certiﬁ cate programs as speciﬁ cally authorized; (9) responsibility for offering programs of statewide impact; and (10) admitting students in the top one half of the class as deﬁ ned in State Regents Policy.  All of these functions except number seven have relevance for East Central University. 2    East Central UniversityMISSION STATEMENTMISSION East Central University’s mission is to foster a learning environment in which students, faculty, staff,  and community interact to educate students for life in a rapidly changing and culturally diverse society.  Within its service area, East Central University provides leadership for economic development and cultural enhancement.STRATEGIES   East Central University acknowledges ﬁ ve areas of importance to fulﬁ ll its mission. 1. To provide academic programs;East Central University’s primary mission is to develop and provide academic programs of study to meet the present and emerging needs of its students.  Through on-campus and off-campus instruction, including electronic delivery, East Central University offers a variety of educational programs for both traditional and non-traditional students.  These programs include:  A. Baccalaureate degree programs in the arts and sciences combine general education courses, which emphasize the common elements of human experience, with courses in a major ﬁ eld to build student capacities for both breadth and specialization.  Students desiring a liberal arts education or careers in education, business, and the service professions may choose from a wide range of majors.  B. Pre-professional programs in areas such as dentistry,engineering, law, medicine, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine prepare students for advanced education in these ﬁ elds.  C. Graduate programs lead to masters degrees ineducation, human resources, business, environmental science and psychological services, as well as opportunities for study required for certiﬁ cation acquisition and renewal. 2. To sustain educational support programs;East Central University seeks to increase student potential for academic and personal success through services and programs which address the diverse educational needs of all students, including students with disabilities.  3. To provide educational enrichment opportunities;Since education involves more than formal classroom work, East Central University sponsors varied organizations and activities to provide enrichment opportunities to enhance a global understanding and a total educational experience. 4. To offer special community/regional services;East Central University serves the community and region by offering and promoting symposia, lectures, programs, cultural activities and economic development.  These services include:  A. Economic development efforts throughout theregion.  East Central University provides the private and public sectors with leadership and expertise for human resource development, entrepreneurial assistance, and employment and income enhancement.  B. Numerous cultural events, many of which reﬂ ect amulti-cultural heritage.   5. To promote professional development and scholarship.East Central University supports the professional development of the faculty by sponsoring workshops, by encouraging conference attendance, and by promoting participation in other professional activities.  East Central University encourages basic, applied, and institutional research as an important contribution to a dynamic academic community complementing its commitment to quality teaching.VISION  East Central University’s vision is to be a leading educational institution which is innovative, responsive, proactive, continuously improving, and a catalyst for the advancement of teaching and learning and for community  and economic development.VALUES Values are core beliefs or desires that guide or motivate attitudes and actions. They also deﬁ ne the things we value and prize the most and, therefore, provide the basis for ranking the things we want in a way that elevates some values over others. East Central University has established the following shared values that unite us as an organization and guide our actions and decisions:  1. IntegrityWe respect and value people by treating others as we want to be treated. We are honest by representing ourselves and our intentions truthfully. 2. Commitment We take responsibility by being at our personal best for East Central University.  We commit to excellence by being personally dedicated to the continuous improvement of East Central University.  3. Diversity We recognize that a diverse faculty, staff, and student body enriches the quality of education and helps to prepare graduates to live and work in a culturally pluralistic, interdependent world. 4. Citizenship We recognize that the worth of an organization is reﬂ ected in its impact on the community and how it conducts its business with others. The University    3    TO THE PROSPECTIVE STUDENT East Central University is an accredited, tax-supported part of the Oklahoma System of Higher Education, directed by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.  East Central University students wishing to continue their education elsewhere in undergraduate, graduate, or professional schools readily transfer their academic credits from East Central University either within or outside of Oklahoma, and East Central University accepts academic credits transferred from accredited institutions.  The University grants bachelors degrees in many of the traditional academic disciplines.  East Central University’s graduate training culminates in the masters degree.  The University prepares students to follow many occupations and educates them in a broad background of general studies.  It prepares students to enter professional and graduate schools and to obtain from various agencies authorizations such as nursing licenses, teachers certiﬁ cates, and military commissions.  The University offers special training not available at many institutions.  It frequently examines its offerings and changes them to suit the needs of the times.  Students who sign the agreement guaranteeing graduation in four years can earn a baccalaureate degree in four years by complying with the requirements.  The University requires students to take certain courses expected of the educated person, and allows them to choose other courses for their own satisfaction.  Courses are conducted in many ways including the traditional lecture method, laboratory work, workshops, individual study, private instruction, educational tours, telecommunicated, experiential learning, off-campus settings and other appropriate ways.  Ada, the location of East Central University, is the commercial, industrial, service, and medical center for a substantial metropolitan and rural area.  A national research laboratory and the seat of government of an Indian nation are in Ada. The city shares the prosperity of its cement, plastic, petroleum, and cattle industries, and of thriving large and small businesses.  Information about attending East Central University may be obtained by contacting the Admissions Ofﬁ ce.  Campus visits are encouraged to help students obtain ﬁ rst-hand knowledge about areas of academic interest.  This catalog may be used as a resource in answering questions concerning many aspects of East Central University.4    East Central UniversitySection II GENERAL INFORMATION OF THE UNDERGRADUATE DIVISIONINSTITUTIONAL ADMISSION AND RETENTIONTheUndergraduate Division  Anyone planning to attend East Central University must apply online at the university’s admission website. The student must support his or her application with the following records:   A. an ofﬁ cial high school transcript;   B. all ofﬁ cial transcripts, including all military transcripts, showing his or her records at each institution (any institution of higher education) in which he or she has enrolled;  C. an ofﬁ cial report of his or her American College Testing Program (ACT) test scores or, if he or she attended high school out of Oklahoma, a record of an approved similar battery of tests.   These records should be ﬁ led in the Records Ofﬁ ce at least two to four weeks before registration.  If the records are in a different language, they must be submitted in authenticated English translations (see International Student Admission for more information).  Undergraduate students applying to East Central University for the ﬁ rst time must pay an application fee before forms will be processed.  If an applicant is accepted for admission as a beginning freshman (a student with six or fewer attempted credit hours, excluding remedial [0-level courses] or pre-college work and excluding credit hours accumulated by concurrently enrolled high school students), the applicant must attend a freshman advisement and enrollment session before registration. A current immunization record or immunization waiver must be on ﬁ le at that time. 6    East Central University3.9.3   Admission of First-Time Freshmen: Curricular    RequirementsStudents must meet the criteria for both the high school curricular requirements and the high school performance requirements as deﬁ ned in the following sections. Students meeting both the high school curricular and the high school performance requirements are eligible for admission.This section includes curricular requirements for regular admission.A. High School Curricular Requirements for Admission to   Programs Leading to AA, AS and Baccalaureate Degrees.Units (Years)Course Areas(4)English (grammar, composition, literature; should include an integrated writing component)(3)Lab Science (Biology, chemistry, physics or any lab science certiﬁ ed by the school district; General science with or without a lab may not be used to meet this requirement.)(3)Mathematics (from algebra I, algebra II, geometry, trigonometry, math analysis, pre-calculus, statistics and probability (must have completed geometry and Algebra II), calculus, Advanced Placement statistics)(3)History and Citizenship Skills (including one unit ofAmerican history and two additional units from thesubjects of history, economics, geography,government, non-Western culture)(2)Additional units of subjects previously listed or selected from: computer science, foreign language, or any Advanced Placement course except applied courses in ﬁ ne arts.15Total Required UnitsComputer science courses (one or more units) that meet the State Regents’ guidelines for high school curricular requirements may satisfy the postsecondary systemwide computer proﬁ ciency graduation requirement (see the State Regents’ Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy). In addition to the above requirements, the following subjects are recommended for college preparation: 2  additional units: Fine arts - music, art, drama, and speech 1  additional unit: Lab science (as described above)1  additional unit: Mathematics (as described above) 4  Recommended Units.While these curricular requirements will normally be met by students in grades 9 through 12, advanced students who complete these courses in earlier grades will not be required to take additional courses for purposes of admission. The remaining units required by the State Board of Education for high school graduation may be selected from courses to meet students’ individual needs and interests.Additionally, 70 O.S. § 11-103.6 outlines the curricular units or sets of competencies that are required to graduate from an Oklahoma public high school. By virtue of this statute, high school courses that satisfy college admission requirements, which are subject to State Regents’ approval, also satisfy speciﬁ c college preparatory/work ready curricular high school graduation requirements. Therefore, if a high school or the Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education wishes to determine if a course will satisfy a college admission curricular requirement, which ﬁ ts within one of the legislatively deﬁ ned college preparatory/work ready curricular subject areas, but is not explicitly detailed therein, it shall require State Regents’ approval. Additional information regarding the course review process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.B.  Curricular Deﬁ ciencies  1.  Baccalaureate Programs Students must meet all basic academic skills curricular requirements (English, mathematics, and science) to be admitted to baccalaureate programs at research or regional institutions. Students with a deﬁ ciency in a non-basic academic skills course (excludes English, mathematics, and science) who present an ACT reading subject score at or above the speciﬁ ed level or who score at the designated level on any approved secondary institutional reading assessment instrument may be admitted as a regular admission student. These students will be required to complete an additional three-hour collegiate course in the relative subject area to make up the high school deﬁ ciency (see the State Regents’ High School Curricular Requirements policy). Other exceptions are noted in the special admission options outlined later in this policy. If an institution admits students with one or more curricular deﬁ ciencies to a baccalaureate program utilizing the alternative admission category, the institution must provide the means to satisfy those deﬁ ciencies (see the State Regents’ High School Curricular Requirements policy) and the student must successfully remediate basic academic skills course requirements within 24 college level hours attempted. Students continuously enrolled in courses designed to remove deﬁ ciencies bay be allowed to continue enrollment beyond the 24 hour limit.2.   Associate in Arts and Associate in Science Programs Students lacking curricular requirements are admissible into AA or AS programs in the community colleges but must remediate curricular deﬁ ciencies in the basic academic skills at the earliest possible time but within the ﬁ rst 24 college-level hours attempted. Students continuously enrolled in courses designed to remove deﬁ ciencies may be allowed to continue enrollment beyond the 24 hour limit. In addition, students must remove curricular deﬁ ciencies in a discipline area before taking collegiate level work in that discipline.3.    Associate in Applied Science Programs Students entering AAS degree programs or other certiﬁ cate programs must remove high school curricular requirement deﬁ ciencies before taking courses in the same ﬁ eld as part of an AAS degree or certiﬁ cate program. Students admitted under this provision may not transfer into an AA, AS or baccalaureate program without ﬁ rst removing the high school curricular deﬁ ciencies.  Students may remove curricular deﬁ ciencies as detailed in the State Regents’ High School Curricular Requirements policy. The institution’s president or the president’s designee may allow a deserving student who failed to remediate a basic academic skills deﬁ ciency in a single subject to continue to enroll in collegiate level courses in addition to remedial INSTITUTIONAL ADMISSION AND RETENTION POLICY(OSRHE Policy 3.9, 4/18)The Undergraduate Division    7    course work beyond the 24-hour limit providing the student has demonstrated success in collegiate courses to date. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented.Students pursuing admission to AA, AS, AAS, or baccalaureate degree programs may not count remedial/development courses toward satisfaction of degree program requirements.C. Applied CoursesThe use of applied courses to meet the high school curricularrequirements is to be considered an alternative. College boundstudents are encouraged to take courses currently speciﬁ ed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy. The State Regents are interested in experimenting with alternative delivery systems that might facilitate student interest and success. It must be noted that the State Regents request and expect high school transcripts to be valid and reﬂ ective of the actual courses taken by students; anything less threatens the integrity of the academic process.One year of Principles of Technology may substitute for one of the currently required lab science courses providing that students taking the course also successfully complete a lab science course listed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy. Additionally, the Principles of Technology course must be taught by a teacher certiﬁ ed or endorsed in physics who has completed the specialized training to instruct the course.  3.9.4  Admission of First-Time Freshmen: Performance            RequirementsStudents must meet the criteria for both the high school curricular requirements and the high school performance requirements as deﬁ ned in the following sections. Students meeting both the high school curricular and the high school performance requirements are eligible for admission. This section includes performance requirements for regular admission which includes three options for admission: standardized tests, high school GPA in all courses plus class rank, or high school GPA in theState Regents’ 15-units of required high school core courses.The ACT score used for admission purposes is the composite score without the writing component. The SAT score used for admission purposes is the combined critical reading and math scores without the writing component. Students utilizing a test other than ACT will have their scores converted to ACT equivalents. The high school class rank is one more than the number of students in the high school graduating class who have a high school GPA greater than the student in question. A GED recipient’s high school class must have graduated to be eligible for admission. The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions on an individual student basis. Any exceptions, including subsequent student academic performance, will be reported to the State Regents upon request. The University of Oklahoma (OU) is authorized by the State Regents to also require a minimum average standard GED score for automatic admission.The high school GPA used for admission purposes in option 2 is the unweighted average of all grades (“A” equating to 4.00 and “D” equating to 1.00) taken in the 9th through 12 grades. The GPA used for admission purposes in option 3 shall add a standard weighting (1.0) to The College Board’s Advanced Placement courses and the International Baccalaureate Organization’s higher-level courses (an “F” remains zero).While the State Regents strongly support the initiation of honors courses, honors weighting will not be used in the calculation of either high school GPA because there is no equitable mechanism to include the honors premium.The exact standardized test scores and high school GPA will vary over time, and may differ at each institution. The high school GPA will be deﬁ ned annually to correspond to the rank in class. The ACT score equivalent to these percentages will be determined based on the average of the preceding three years’ ACT scores of graduating seniors if available. Oklahoma test data will be used. The concordance table usedto set the equivalent SAT score is updated regularly. First-time entering students must also meet entry-level assessment requirements before enrolling in college-level courses. See the State Regents’ Student Assessment and Remediation policy for more information.A.  Minimum High School Performance Criteria for Admission of First-Time-Entering Students at Regional UniversitiesAny individual who:1. is a graduate of a high school accredited by the appropriate regional association or by an appropriate accrediting agency of the home state or has achieved a high school equivalency certiﬁ cate based on the GED;2. has met the curricular requirements as set forth in part 3.9.3 of this policy;3. has participated in the ACT program or a similar acceptable     battery of tests; and4. meets the following criteria is eligible for admission to     any of the regional universities in the State System.Minimum Performance-Based Admission Standards: Regional UniversitiesOption 1: Standardized TestsACT or SAT (ECU=20 ACT)Top 50%OROption 2:High SchoolPerformance AGPA (All Courses) and Class Rank (ECU=2.7 and upper half)Top 50%OROption 3:High SchoolPerformance BGPA in State Regents’Required 15-unit H.S.Core (ECU=2.7)Top 50%3.9.5    International Student Admission and Admission               of Non-native Speakers of EnglishInternational undergraduate students are required to meet equivalent academic performance standards as listed in section 3.9.4 above. Additionally, both ﬁ rst-time undergraduate and graduate students for whom English is a second language shall be required to present evidence of proﬁ ciency in the English language prior to admission, either as ﬁ rst-time students to the system or by transfer from another non-system college or university. The State Regents adopted this policy to ensure that students will have a reasonable chance to succeed at a higher education institution based on their ability to comprehend, read, and write the English language. 8    East Central UniversityStudents must meet one of the standards described below to demonstrate their competency in English. Institutions may not waive this admission requirement as part of the alternative admissions category within the State Regents’ general policy on admission. A. First-Time Undergraduate and Graduate Students1. Standardized Testing. Students must meet the minimum score set by the State Regents on either the Test of  English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) Examination.Results of the TOEFL taken at international testing centers and special testing centers will be accepted at all State System colleges and universities. Results of the TOEFL administered at institutional testing centers shall not be accepted by colleges and universities other than the administering institution.2. Intensive English Program (IEP). Students must meet a minimum score set by the State Regents on the TOEFL administered at a special testing center or an international testing center or on the IELTS Examination. In addition, after achieving the required score and immediately prior to admission, successfully complete a minimum of 12 weeks of study at an IEP approved by the State Regents. At least two-thirds of the 12 weeks must be instruction at an advanced level. A list of State Regents’ approved IEPs can be found in the State Regents’ Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.3. High School Performance. Undergraduate students must have successfully completed the high school core requirements in or graduate from high school where English is the primary language in a country where English is a primary language and demonstrate competency through the High School Curricular Requirements policy. 4. Graduate students may satisfy the English language  requirement by completing a baccalaureate or graduate degree from a college or university where English is the primary teaching language in a country where English is a primary language and that is recognized by professional organizations in the U.S. involved in admissions and international education.5. Institutional Discretion. In extraordinary and deserving cases, the president or the president’s designee may admit a student in lieu of the above requirements. In these situations, the applicant must have demonstrated proﬁ ciency in the English language by some other means prior to admission. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented and reported to the State Regents annually.Undergraduate Students with Standardized Testing:TOEFL TestMinimum ScoreInternet-Based61Computer-Based173Paper-Based500IELTS Test5.5Graduate Students with Standardized TestingTOEFL TestMinimum ScoreInternet-Based79Computer-Based213Undergraduate Students with Standardized Testing:TOEFL TestMinimum ScorePaper-Based550IELTS Test6.5Undergraduate Students with IEP:TOEFL TestMinimum ScoreInternet-Based48Computer-Based140Paper-Based460IELTS Test5.0Graduate Students with IEP:TOEFL TestMinimum ScoreInternet-Based61Computer-Based173Paper-Based500IELTS Test5.5 B.  Undergraduate Transfer StudentsSee Undergraduate Transfer and Articulation Policy (3.11.3), subsection C, for details concerning non-native speakers of English student transfer procedures.3.9.6  Special AdmissionStudents admitted must meet curricular standards as deﬁ ned in section 3.9.4, and must meet the high school performance criteria as deﬁ ned in section 3.9.4.  The only exceptions are students admitted in the following special admission categories.A.   Special Non-Degree Seeking StudentStudents who wish to enroll in courses without intending to pursue a degree may be permitted to enroll in no more than nine credit hours without submitting academic credentials or meeting the academic curricular or performance requirements of the institution of desired entry. Retention standards will be enforced. Once a student has completed the designated number of hours, the student is required to meet the formal admission or transfer criteria for the institution of desired entry in order to enroll in additional course work. (This provision is not intended to be limited only to ﬁ rst-time-entering students.)The president or the president’s designee may allow non-degree-seeking students to exceed this initial nine credit-hour limit on an individual student basis. Such exceptions may be made for non-degree-seeking students only who meet the retention standards and must be  appropriately documented and reported to the State Regents annually.B.   Alternative AdmissionResearch and regional institutions may admit 8 percent of the number of previous year’s ﬁ rst-time freshmen or 50 students (whichever is greater) without the students having met the State Regents’ high school curricular or performance admission requirements. Institutions admitting students The Undergraduate Division    9    through the alternative admission category must have formally established admission criteria on ﬁ le at the State Regents’ ofﬁ ce. The criteria must be oriented to identifying those students who:1. have a reasonable chance for academic success;2. have unusual talent or ability in art, drama, music, sports, etc; or3. are educationally or economically disadvantaged and show promise of being able to succeed in a program or curriculum at the institution where they desire to enroll. Institutions should use interviews as a part of the mechanism for admitting students in this program. Students wishing to enter under the alternative admission category should be given the opportunity to convince the institutions of their ability through this interview process. In addition, the institution must have implemented programs designed to assist ﬁ rst-year students making the transition to college both academically and socially. The objective of these procedures and programs is to increase the success rate of students as measured by the increase in the retention and graduation rates of all students and particularly minority students.It is intended that the alternative admission opportunities be equitably utilized and proportionately represent different types of students of unusual talent or abilities who do not otherwise meet State Regents’ admission standards. Waivers shall not be awarded in signiﬁ cant disproportion for scholarship athletes. It shall be used to promote the system goal of social justice.C.   Adult Admission1. Students who are 21 years of age or older or on active military duty may be admitted based on criteria established at the campus level and submitted to and approved by the State Regents. For students admitted under the adult admission category, the campus must consider the probability of the academic success of the student. Related to the curricular requirements, students admitted under the adult admission category must demonstrate proﬁ ciency to the satisfaction of the entering institution in the curricular area the student desires to pursue. Institutions will be required to submit an annual report of those students admitted in this category to the State Regents.2. Any student who:a. is not a high school graduate but whose high school class has graduated; andb.  has participated in the ACT program or similar battery of tests is eligible for admission to any of the community colleges in the State System. Students utilizing a test other than ACT will have their scores converted to ACT equivalents. A GED recipient’s high school class must have graduated to be eligible for admission. The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions on an individual student basis. Any exceptions, including subsequent student academic performance, will be reported to the State Regents upon request.D.   Home Study or Non-Recognized Accredited or     Unaccredited High SchoolsAn individual who is a graduate of a private, parochial, or other nonpublic high school which is not accredited by a recognized accrediting agency is eligible for admission to an institution in the State System as follows:1. The student must have participated in the ACT or SAT program and achieved the requisite composite score, as deﬁ ned by the State Regents, for admission to the institution the student wishes to attend as deﬁ ned in section 3.9.4 above. OU is authorized by the State Regents to require a minimum high school GPA, class rank, or GED average standard score along with a requisite composite score.2. The student’s high school class of his or her peers must have graduated. The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions for GED recipients on an individual student basis. Any exceptions, including subsequent student academic performance, will be reported to the State Regents upon request.3. The student must satisfy the high school curricular requirements for the institution to which the student is applying, as certiﬁ ed by the school or for home study, the parent.E.   Opportunity Admission CategoryStudents who have not graduated from high school whose composite standard score on the ACT without the writing component places them at the 99th percentile of all students using Oklahoma norms, or whose combined critical reading and mathematical score on the SAT without the writing component places them at the 99th percentile of all students using national norms may apply for full enrollment at a college or university of the State System. The college or university will determine admissibility based on test scores, evaluation of the student’s level of maturity and ability to function in the adult college environment, and whether the experience will be in the best interest of the student intellectually and socially. F.  Correspondence Study Enrollment Admission to the institution is not required for enrollment in correspondence work. However, academic credit for correspondence work will not be applicable toward a degree until such time as the student has been formally admitted to the institution and has secured the approval of the appropriate academic ofﬁ cers for such credit. Students who desire to apply credit for correspondence courses must make the necessary arrangements with the school where credit is to be applied. Completed courses will appear on the student’s ofﬁ cial transcript and be designated as correspondence study.G.   Summer Provisional Admission Program (Research     and Regional Universities)1. Student Admission RequirementsApplicants for the Summer Provisional Admission Program must meet the following criteria to be considered for admission: a. Be a ﬁ rst-time-entering student.b. Graduate from an accredited high school or achieve a high school equivalency certiﬁ cate based on the GED. The student’s high school class of his or her peers must have graduated. The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions for GED recipients on an individual student basis. Any exceptions, including e. To continue, the provisionally admitted student must complete a minimum of six credit hours in the summer as speciﬁ ed above with no grade lower than a “C.” Such students will be admitted as a regular university student in the subsequent semester.f. A provisionally admitted student who does not meet the academic requirements previously detailed will be unable to enroll for further work at the university until such time as the student is eligible for regular transfer admission as detailed in the State Regents’ Undergraduate Transfer and Articulation policy.H.  Summer Provisional Admission Program:      Curricular Deﬁ ciencies (Regional Universities)Regional university students meeting performance requirements may take a maximum of two course deﬁ ciencies in the summer term prior to the regular semester of desired entry. If the college-level course(s) (are) successfully completed with at least a “C” or equivalent, the student will be admitted.I.   Concurrent Enrollment of High School Students The admission and retention standards for concurrent enrollment students are detailed within the State Regents’ Concurrent Enrollment policy3.9.7   Admission by TransferRefer to page 14 of ECU Catalog, Undergraduate Transfer and Articulation Policy (3.11.3). 3.9.8   Retention StandardsIn keeping with this philosophy of maximizing student success, institutions are strongly urged to initiate or strengthen programs which will assure that students experiencing academic difﬁ culties will be provided appropriate academic assistance. Such specially designed programs should include, but not be limited to, academic and career counseling, tutoring opportunities, study skills sessions, and diagnostic testing as appropriate. Students on academic notice or academic probation should be required as a condition for continued enrollment to participate in these special academic support services. These programs should be available to all students who feel participation will enhance their academic performance and success.A. GPA RequirementsAll students must maintain a 2.0 GPA for the duration of the college experience with the exception of freshmen on academic notice and academic probation. A student will be placed on academic probation if the following requirements are not met: Credit Hours Attempted   GPA Requirement0 through 30 semester credit hours                       1.7Greater than 30 semester credit hours                2.0Students with 30 or fewer credit hours, with a GPA of 1.7 to less than 2.0 will be placed on academic notice. All courses in which a student has a recorded grade will be counted in the calculation of the GPA for retention purposes excluding any courses repeated, reprieved or renewed as detailed in the State Regents’ Grading policy, developmental education, and physical education activity courses.10    East Central Universitysubsequent  student academic performance, will be reported to the State Regents upon request.c.  Meet the State Regents’ curricular requirements for admission.d. Have a minimum composite ACT of 18 or a minimum  high school grade-point average of 2.5 to be admitted to a research university; or have a minimum composite ACT of 17 or a minimum high school grade-point average of 2.5 to be admitted to a regional university. e.  Participate in assessment for placement purposes. If the  need for developmental education is indicated, the student must successfully complete the developmental education prior to entering this provisional program. The ﬁ nal admission decision will be made by the appropriate institutional ofﬁ cials based on the applicant’s academic performance and potential for success.         2. Program Requirementsa.  Enrollment is restricted to the summer session immediately following the student’s high school graduation.b. Each student is required to register for a minimum of two summer session core academic courses (at least six hours), exclusive of credit by examination or correspondence study. Students must take one course in each of the ﬁ rst two categories listed below:English: Either of the introductory college-levelEnglish courses unless the student through advanced standing credit or concurrent enrollment has previously acquired such credit. If such credit has previously been earned, then the student may take an additional course in one of the categories listed below.Mathematics: College algebra or the equivalent unless the student through advanced standing credit or concurrent enrollment has previously earned such credit. If such credit has previously been earned, then the student may take an additional course in one of the categories listed below. Students testing out of the introductory English and/or Mathematics courses must select courses from the following categories:Social Science: A college-level course approved for general education credit.Natural Science: A college-level introductory lab science course approved for general education credit.Humanities: A college-level course approved for general education credit.c. It is expected that these courses will be taught with equivalent rigor in presentation, assignments, and grading as the same courses taught during the regular semesters. Institutions are encouraged to use regular faculty members.d. Students admitted in this program will be required to participate in academic support programs designed to enhance their success. Such services should include academic tutoring, mentoring opportunities, career counseling, diagnostic testing, etc.The Undergraduate Division    11    Any student not maintaining satisfactory progress toward the academic objective as indicated above will be placed on probation for one semester. At the end of that semester, the student must have a semester GPA of 2.0 in regularly-graded course work, not to include activity or performance courses, or meet the minimum GPA standard required above, in order to continue as a student. Students not meeting either of these criteria will be immediately suspended and may not be reinstated until one regular semester (fall or spring) has elapsed. Students suspended in the spring semester may attend, at the discretion of the suspending institution, the summer session immediately following spring suspension. However, such students may enroll only in core academic courses which meet the general education requirements or degree requirements. The student’s transcript will note suspension at the end of the spring semester. For students who fail to achieve retention standards after the summer session, the phrase “suspension continued” should be entered on the transcript at the end of the summer session. Only students under ﬁ rst-time suspension status at the suspending institution are eligible. To continue in that fall semester, such students must achieve a 2.0 semester GPA or raise their GPA to the required level.B.  Suspension of SeniorsAn institution may allow a student with 90 or more hours in a speciﬁ ed degree program who has failed to meet the GPA of 2.0 or the semester GPA of 2.0 to enroll in up to 15 additional semester hours in a further attempt to achieve the GPA requirement. During this 15 hours of enrollment, the student must achieve a minimum 2.0 semester GPA during each enrollment or raise the GPA to 2.0 or above. This senior suspension exception can be exercised only once per student.C.  Academic Suspension AppealsInstitutions have the discretion to establish an academic suspension appeals procedure. Such procedures should allow appropriate discretion in deserving cases. Academic suspension appeal procedures should require that the suspended student document any extraordinary personal circumstances that contributed to the academic deﬁ ciencies. Such events must be highly unusual such as the death of an immediate relative; a serious illness; severe ﬁ nancial distress; direct, signiﬁ cant work conﬂ icts; unexpected, substantial family obligations; or personal crisis. Such appeals decisions should be made only following the thoughtful deliberation of an appropriate committee which may include faculty, students, and administrators. Any institutional policies and procedures developed for the appeal of academic suspension decisions must be submitted to and approved by the State Regents. Annual reports detailing all decisions concerning appeals requests will be submitted to the State Regents.D.  Readmission of Suspended StudentsStudents who are academically suspended by an institution will not be allowed to reenter the suspending institution for at least one regular semester (fall or spring) except as noted above. Institutions should develop policies and procedures to guide the readmission of suspended students. Such policies should include the provision that suspended students can be readmitted only one time. Such students are readmitted on probationary status and must maintain a 2.0 GPA average each semester attempted while on probation or raise their GPA to the designated level. Should a reinstated student be suspended a second time from the same institution, the student cannot return to the suspending school until such time as the student has demonstrated, by attending another institution, the ability to succeed academically by raising the GPA to the retention standards.E.  Reinstatement of Suspended Students at System InstitutionsIt is the intent of the State Regents that public higher education opportunities be provided for all citizens with the ability and desire to use these public services. As previously stated, students will not be permitted readmission to the suspending institution for a minimum of one regular semester (fall or spring). However, research indicates that many times students suspended from one institution may succeed in a new academic environment if given the opportunity. As such, institutions may develop a special admission procedure, subject to State Regents’ approval, for students who are suspended from other system institutions and who would otherwise qualify for admission to the reinstating institution. Such students would be admitted at the discretion of the receiving institution and such admission would be probationary. Institutions admitting such students should provide the appropriate academic services to facilitate their success.3.9.10   Non-Academic Criteria for AdmissionA. In addition to the academic criteria used by institutions in the State System as the basis for student admission, institutions shall consider the following non-academic criteria in deciding whether a ﬁ rst-time applicant or a transfer student shall be granted admission:1. Whether an applicant has been expelled, suspended, denied admission or denied readmission by any other educational institution.2. Whether an applicant has been convicted of a felony or convicted of any lesser crime involving moral turpitude.3. Whether an applicant’s conduct has been such that if, at the time of the conduct in question, the applicant had been a student at the institution to which application is made, the course of conduct would have been grounds for expulsion, suspension, dismissal or denial of readmission.B. If the institution ﬁ nds that an applicant has any of the above, then the institution shall deny admission to applicant if it decides that any of the events described indicates the applicant’s unﬁ tness, at the time of application, to be a student at the institution to which application is made.If an applicant is denied admission on any of the foregoing grounds, there must be substantial evidence supporting the basis for denial.  In addition, the applicant must be afforded adequate procedural safeguards, including the following:1. Be advised of the ground of the denial.2. Be informed of the facts which form a basis of the  denial.3. Be afforded an opportunity to be heard.Institutions should establish a hearing committee or some other appropriate mechanism to guarantee the proper administration of the procedural safeguards outlined above.12    East Central University3.10.3   Eligibility RequirementsA.  AdmissionA junior or senior high school student may be admitted provisionally to a college or university in the State System. Minimum standards for State System institutions are outlined in the tables below. The ACT score is the composite score without the writing component and the SAT score is the composite score without the essay component.A State System institution that wishes to admit a junior or senior high school student, who does not meet one of the applicable criteria detailed below, may submit a request for an exception to allow the student to enroll in a speciﬁ c course in which the student has demonstrated exceptional ability. An institution shall grant admission to such a student only if the request for an exception is approved by the Chancellor.1. Students from Accredited High SchoolsStudents from accredited high schools shall meet one of the criteria listed in the table below. Acceptable exams include:a.  A national ACT or an acceptable national preparatory ACT instrument that is listed in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook;b. One residual ACT per year (from November 1 to October 31), which is only valid at the  institution at which it was administered; orc. A national SAT or an acceptable national preparatory SAT instrument that is listed in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.ACT/SAT at 50th Percentile (ECU=20 ACT)ORUnweighted High School GPA 3.0andClass Rank - top 50%2. Home Schooled Students and Students from Unaccredited High Schools Home schooled students and students from unaccredited high schools shall have completed enough high school coursework to be equivalent to an individual who is classiﬁ ed as a junior or senior at an accredited high school and meet the applicable criterion in the table below. Acceptable exams include:a. A national ACT or an acceptable national predictive model ACT instrument that is listed in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook;b. One residual ACT per year (from November 1 to October 31), which is only valid at the  institution at which it was administered; or c. A national SAT or an acceptable national predictive    model SAT instrument that is listed in the Academic    Affairs Procedures Handbook.ACT/SAT at 50th Percentile (ECU=20 ACT)3. All students must have a signed form from the high school principal or counselor stating that he/she is eligible to satisfy requirements for graduation from high school (including curricular requirements for college admission) no later than the spring of the senior year. Students must also have written permission from a parent or legal guardian.B.   Course Placement and Enrollment1. Curriculum RequirementsAt minimum, concurrent students shall demonstrate college readiness in a particular subject area to be eligible to enroll in a college level course in the corresponding subject area. A high school student not demonstrating college readiness in science reasoning, mathematics, or English will not be permitted enrollment in the corresponding college subject area. A student who is unable to demonstrate college readiness in  reading will not be permitted enrollment in any other collegiate course (outside the subjects of science, mathematics, and English). Concurrent enrollment students are prohibited from enrolling in any form of developmental education, including any conﬁ guration in which developmental education is embedded within a credit bearing course. A concurrent student shall demonstrate college readiness by:a. Attaining the requisite subject score on an acceptable ACT exam;b. Attaining the requisite subject score on an acceptable SAT exam; orc. Satisfying an entry level assessment and course placement measure that is in accordance with the institution’s State Regents approved assessment plan.2. Workload A high school student admitted under the provision set forth below may enroll in a combined number of high school and college courses per semester not to exceed a full-time college workload of 19 semester-credit-hours. A student may enroll in a maximum of nine semester-credit-hours during a summer session or term at a college or university of the State System without the necessity of being concurrently enrolled in high school classes during the summer term. For purposes of calculating workload, one-half high school unit shall be equivalent to three semester-credit-hours of college work. Non-academic high school units are excluded from the workload calculation. Students wishing to exceed these limits may petition the selected higher education institution. The appropriate higher education ofﬁ cials will evaluate the student’s academic performance and potential for success in determining the student’s load, which may not exceed the number of semester-credit-hours 50 percent greater than the number of weeks in the applicable semester/term. The college should provide appropriate academic advising prior to and continuing throughout the student’s enrollment.3. Academic CalendarConcurrent enrollment students shall be subject to the higher education institution’s academic calendar.4. Continuing EnrollmentCONCURRENT ENROLLMENT POLICY(OSRHE Policy 3.10, 5/17)The Undergraduate Division    13    13    East Central UniversityHigh school students concurrently enrolled in college courses may continue concurrent enrollment in subsequent semesters if they achieve a college grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or above on a 4.0 scale. Therefore, a concurrent student who fails to achieve the requisite 2.0 college GPA shall not be eligible for concurrent enrollment at any State System institution. Additionally, congruous with the State Regents’ Grading policy, if a concurrent enrollment student’s college GPA falls within a range that requires one to be placed on academic probation, the academic probationary status shall be notated on the academic transcript. Following high school graduation, a student who has been concurrently enrolled as a high school student may be admitted to the original institution of concurrent enrollment or another institution in the State System if the student meets the college or university’s entrance requirements, including the high school curriculum requirements, and subject to the State Regents’ retention standards.3.10.4   Dual CreditPursuant to 70 O.S. §628.13, when a student earns college credit through concurrent enrollment, school districts shall provide academic credit for any concurrently enrolled higher education courses that are correlated with the academic credit awarded by the institution of higher education. Academic credit shall only be transcripted as elective credit if there is no correlation between the concurrent enrollment higher education course and a course provided by the school district.3.10.5   Collegiate ExperienceConcurrent enrollment must include opportunities for high school students to achieve college credit through a collegiate experience. The collegiate experience is evidenced by the rigor and learning outcomes of the course, the qualiﬁ cations of the faculty delivering the course, and the student’s readiness for college. The collegiate experience can be present on- and off-campus and may include:A.   High school students enrolled in a course on a college or university campus with collegiate students including online delivery off-campus.B.   High School students enrolled in an off-campus college or university course, which does not include collegiate students, and offered under the parameters prescribed within the off- campus concurrent enrollment section of this policy.3.10.6  Off Campus Concurrent EnrollmentA.   Institutional RequirementsA higher education institution offering an off-campus concurrent course shall have direct oversight of all aspects of such a course. Therefore, a higher education institution that wishes to engage in off-campus concurrent enrollment shall meet the following standards.1. Course Offerings and Student Expectationsa. Off-campus concurrent enrollment courses shall be the same catalogued courses offered on-campus at the sponsoring higher education institution. Additionally, the course syllabus and student learning outcomes in an off-campus concurrent enrollment course shall be identical to the course syllabus and student learning outcomes that are used when the same course is taught on the sponsoring higher education institution’s campus.b. Off-campus concurrent enrollment courses shall be of the same content and rigor as the courses offered on-campus at the sponsoring higher education institution.c. Students enrolled in off-campus concurrent enrollment courses shall be held to the same standard of achievement as students in on- campus courses. 2. Faculty Qualiﬁ cationsa. Faculty teaching off-campus concurrent enrollment courses shall meet the academic requirements for faculty and instructors teaching in the sponsoring higher education institution as required by the Higher Learning Commission.b. The appropriate academic administrator at the sponsoring higher education institution shall review credentials and recommend all faculty for approval prior to allowing such individuals to teach an off-campus concurrent enrollment course.3. Orientation and Professional Developmenta. Before teaching an off-campus concurrent enrollment course, faculty shall participate in an orientation provided by the sponsoring higher education institution.b. The sponsoring higher education institution shall provide the faculty teaching the off-campus concurrent enrollment course with professional development opportunities that may include, but need not be limited to: pedagogy, instructional design, course management, and student engagement strategies.4. Evaluationa. A faculty member teaching an off-campus concurrent course shall be evaluated in a manner consistent with the sponsoring higher education institution’s guidelines for student evaluation of faculty.b. A faculty member teaching an off-campus concurrent enrollment course shall be evaluated in accordance with the sponsoring higher education institution’s policy for evaluation of instruction.5. Memorandum of UnderstandingA state system institution shall create a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with each off-campus location it utilizes to offer a concurrent enrollment course. The MOU shall detail the various expectations, obligations, and responsibilities of both the off-campus entity and the sponsoring higher education institution. A senior level administrator from the off-campus entity and sponsoring higher education institution shall sign the MOU and each entity shall retain a copy of it for record keeping purposes. B. Geographic Service AreaA State System institution offering concurrent enrollment should primarily aim to provide such opportunities within its designated geographic service area. If an institution wishes to offer a concurrent enrollment course at an off-campus location outside of its geographic service area or at an off-campus location that is closer to another State System institution (“home rule”), the institution shall adhere to any applicable requirements that are speciﬁ ed in the State Regents’ Distance Education and Traditional Off-Campus Courses 14    East Central UniversityThe Undergraduate Division    14    3.11.3   Admission of Transfer Students From Degree-    granting InstitutionsA.   Admission by Transfer within the State SystemUndergraduate students entering a State System institution bytransfer from another State System institution must meet one of the following:1. Students originally meeting both the high school curricular requirements and academic performance standards of the institution to which the student wishes to transfer must have a GPA high enough to meet the institution’s retention standards as deﬁ ned in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy.2. Students originally meeting the high school curricular requirements but not the academic performance standards of the institution to which the student wishes to transfer must have a GPA high enough to meet the institution’s retention standards based on at least 24 attempted semester credit hours of regularly graded (A, B, C, D, F) college work.3. Students originally meeting the performance but not the curricular requirements of the institution to which the student wishes to transfer must have a GPA high enough to meet that institution’s retention standards as deﬁ ned in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy and must also complete the curricular requirements before transferring.4. A student originally meeting neither the curricular nor the performance requirements of the institution to which the student wishes to transfer must have a GPA high enough to meet the institution’s retention standards based on at least 24 attempted semester credit hours of regularly-graded (A, B, C, D, F) college work and must also complete the curricular requirements of the institution to which the student wishes to transfer before transferring.B.   Admission by Transfer from Non-State System, Degree-       granting InstitutionsUndergraduate students wishing to transfer from non-State System institutions to an institution in the State System may do so by meeting the entrance requirements of the receiving institution as outlined in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy; and also meet the following:1. Transcripts of record from colleges and universities accredited by the HLC or other regional associations will be given full value.a. Each undergraduate applicant must be in good standing in the institution from which the applicant plans to transfer.b. Each undergraduate applicant must have made satisfactory progress (an average grade of “C” or better or meet this policy’s current retention standards, whichever is higher) in the institution from which the applicant plans to transfer.2. Transcripts of record from degree-granting institutions accredited by a national association are subject to review and may transfer on a course-by-course basis.a. Each applicant must meet the conditions of 1.a and 1.b above.3. Transcripts of record from degree-granting institutions not accredited by a regional or national association may be accepted in transfer when appropriate to the student’s degree program and when the receiving institution has had an opportunity to validate the courses or programs.a. Each undergraduate applicant must meet the conditions of 1.a and 1.b above.b. Each undergraduate applicant who meets 1.a and l.b above will also be required to validate the transferred credit by successful completion (an average of “C” or better) of 12 or more semester credit hours at the awarding institution.C.  Non-native Speakers of EnglishTransfer students who are non-native speakers of English must meet the same transfer admission standards as outlined in 3.11.3 subsection A or B, dependent upon their educational background or have attended a college or university where English is the primary teaching language in a country where English is a primary language and that is recognized by professional organizations in the U.S. involved in admissions and international education for a minimum of 24 semester credit hours with passing grades and also meet other transfer requirements.Student with less than 24 hours from a college or university where English is the primary teaching language in a country UNDERGRADUATE TRANSFER AND ARTICULATION POLICY(OSRHE Policy 3.11, 4/18and Programs policy.3.10.7   ReportingA. State Regents’ staff will use the Unitized Data System (UDS) to  annually report the following to the State Regents:1. Number of all concurrent enrollment credit hours attempted and completed;2. Average grade point average of all concurrent enrollment students;3. Number of concurrent enrollment credit hours attempted and completed by students who speciﬁ cally participated in off-campus concurrent enrollment courses; and4. Average grade point average of concurrent enrollments students who speciﬁ cally participated in off-campus concurrent enrollment courses.B. To ensure a commitment to meeting the requirements in the off-campus concurrent enrollment section of this policy, institutions that conduct off-campus concurrent enrollment shall annually submit:1. A copy of each signed off-campus concurrent enrollment MOU; and2. A list of all faculty teaching off-campus concurrent enrollment, including the courses taught as well as his/her academic qualiﬁ cations.The Undergraduate Division    15    15    East Central Universitywhere English is a primary language and that is recognized by professional organizations in the U.S. involved in admissions and international education must meet the language requirements for ﬁ rst-time undergraduate students.D.   Transfer ProbationStudents who do not meet the academic criteria including curricular requirements in section A or B above, but have not been formally suspended, may be admitted as transfer probation students. Institutions may develop policies and procedures, subject to State Regents approval, to guide the admission of transfer students who do not meet the requirements. Such policies should include that these students are admitted on probation and must maintain a 2.0 GPA average each semester while on probation or raise their GPA to the designated level, as detailed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy. Any transfer probation student with curricular deﬁ ciencies must remove the deﬁ ciencies within the ﬁ rst 12 hours of enrollment. Additionally, it is expected that institutions will provide the appropriate academic support services to assist such students in achieving academic success.E.   Higher StandardsThe University of Oklahoma (OU) and Oklahoma State University (OSU) are authorized by the State Regents to assume higher standards for admission by transfer. Standards for the admission of students as stated above are considered minimum. Institutions may request higher standards.3.11.4   Transfer of Course Work Within the State     System from Degree-granting InstitutionsThe following guidelines for transfer of students among institutions have been adopted for the State System.A.   A student who has completed the prescribed lower-division requirements of a State System institution developed in accordance with the standards set forth in the State Regents’ Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy may transfer into a baccalaureate degree program at any senior institution of the State System and be assured of completing his or her program in sequential fashion. Senior institutions may, with the approval of the State Regents, require that transferring students complete additional general education work for the degree. However, such additional work shall be programmed as a part of the upper division requirements of the senior institution in order that any student shall be able to complete a baccalaureate program in a number of semester hours equal to the total speciﬁ ed for graduation published in the receiving institution’s ofﬁ cial catalog.B.  It is understood, however, that it might be necessary for certain students to take additional courses in general education to meet minimum professional certiﬁ cation requirements as deﬁ ned by the state. It is also understood that the completion of these requirements does not preclude requirements of senior institutions of particular GPAs for admission to professional departments or ﬁ elds.C.   It is further understood that it is the responsibility of the transferring institution to provide adequate counseling to enable  a student to complete during the freshman and sophomore years those lower-division courses which are published prerequisites to pursuit of junior level courses of his or her chosen major disciplinary ﬁ eld.D.   The baccalaureate degree in all Oklahoma senior-level institutions shall be awarded in recognition of lower-division (freshman and sophomore) combined with upper-division (junior and senior) work. If a student has completed an AA or AS degree, the lower-division general education requirement of the baccalaureate degree shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the associate degree, providing the general education requirements speciﬁ ed herein are met. If, for any reason, a student has not completed an associate degree program prior to his or her transfer to another institution, the general education requirements shall become the responsibility of the receiving institutions. However, the receiving institution will recognize general education credit for all transfer courses in which a reasonable equivalency of discipline or course content exists with courses speciﬁ ed as part of general education at the receiving institution, provided that there is an appropriate correspondence between the associate degree and the baccalaureate degree being sought.E.   If a student has completed general education courses at a baccalaureate degree-recommending institution within the State System, the receiving baccalaureate institution will recognize general education credit for all courses in which a reasonable equivalency or discipline or course content exists with courses speciﬁ ed as part of general education at the receiving institution, provided that there is an appropriate correspondence of disciplinary study.F.   Lower-division programs in all state institutions enrolling freshmen and sophomores may offer introductory courses which permit the student to explore the principal professional specializations that can be pursued at the baccalaureate level. These introductory courses shall be adequate in content to be fully counted toward the baccalaureate degree for students continuing in such a professional ﬁ eld of specialization. The determination of the major course requirements for a baccalaureate degree, including courses in the major taken in the lower division, shall be the responsibility of the institution awarding the degree. However, courses classiﬁ ed as upper- division courses generally taken by sophomores at senior institutions, even though taught at a community college as lower-division courses, should be transferable as satisfying that part of the student’s requirement in the content area.G.   Courses offered at the freshman or sophomore (1000 or 2000) level at baccalaureate degree-recommending institutions may be offered at a community college provided that such courses are included in the community college’s approved instructional program.H.   Other associate degrees and certiﬁ cates may be awarded by institutions for programs which have requirements different from the aforementioned degrees, or a primary objective other than transfer. Acceptance of course credits for transfer from such degree or certiﬁ cate programs will be evaluated by the receiving institution on the basis of applicability of the courses to the baccalaureate program in the major ﬁ eld of the student. Each receiving institution is encouraged to develop admission policies that will consider all factors indicating the possibility of success of these students in its upper division.I.   Each baccalaureate degree-recommending institution shall list and update the requirements for each program leading to the baccalaureate degree and shall publicize these requirements for use by all other institutions in the State System. Each baccalaureate degree-recommending institution shall include in its ofﬁ cial publications (whether print or electronic) information stating all lower-division prerequisite requirements for each upper-division course. All requirements for admission to a university, college, or program should be set forth with precision and clarity. The degree requirements in effect at the time of the student’s initial full-time enrollment in any State System college or university shall govern lower-division prerequisites, provided that the student has had 16    East Central Universitycontinuous enrollment in the State System as deﬁ ned in the ofﬁ cial college or university publications.J.   Institutions are encouraged to publish, distribute, and keep current transfer guides. The transfer guides should include institutional procedures for the evaluation of course equivalency and a description of the appeals process. A systemwide course transfer matrix is maintained online and updated annually by the State Regents.K.   Credit for prior learning, once recorded at a State System institution, is transferable on the same basis as if the credit had been earned through regular study at the awarding institution. See the State Regents’ Credit for Prior Learning policy.L.   State System institutions may determine course equivalencies through various methods, including articulation agreements, institutional evaluation of individual courses, as well as through the Course Equivalency Project. Courses listed under the same Common Course category on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix shall be accepted by all institutions listed in that category as equivalent for the academic year during which those institutions’ courses are listed. By participating in the same process as State System institutions, independent degree-granting institutions based in Oklahoma may list courses on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix.1. The Course Equivalency Project Matrix is updated each academic year. Detailed information regarding the process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.2. The Course Equivalency Project Matrix is updated each academic year. Detailed information regarding the process may be found in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.3. Courses listed on the Course Equivalency Project Matrix satisfy content requirements for all courses listed within the same Common Course category; however, all degree requirements listed in the State Regents’ Undergraduate Degree Requirements policy must be met before the degree may be awarded.3.11.5   Transfer of Course Work from Oklahoma    Technology Centers Through the Statewide    Articulation AgreementThe purpose of the Statewide Articulation Agreement is to expand, not outsource through contractual arrangement (see Contractual Arrangements Between Higher Education Institutions and Other Entities policy) or prior learning assessment (see Credit for Prior Learning policy), student access to Oklahoma’s educational opportunities. The Statewide Articulation Agreement includes a list of technical courses which meet technical major degree requirements at participating State System of Higher Education institutions, and which will be accepted in transfer from Oklahoma technology centers towards a college technical certiﬁ cate, an associate in applied science degree, or a technology baccalaureate degree. The Statewide Articulation Agreement strengthens the education and training programs that lead to employment in occupational and technical ﬁ elds in Oklahoma.A.  Principles. The Statewide Articulation Agreement will:1. Adhere to academic educational standards and policies as speciﬁ ed by the State Regents for Higher Education and the ODCTE. 2. Inform students about the participating higher education institutions offering technical certiﬁ cate and degree programs for which technical courses from an Oklahoma technology center are listed on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix. These courses may be applicable for technical degree major requirements or technical degree major electives, but not as general elective credit.3. Facilitate articulation with an uninterrupted sequence of learning experiences for technology center students.4. Provide students who are enrolled in technology center courses and programs included on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix the opportunity to continue their educational careers in higher education.5. Ensure the efﬁ cient use of public resources and expand access to educational services.B.   Requirements for College Course Transfer Credit1. Students who successfully complete Oklahoma technology center courses and/or programs listed on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix may earn college transfer credit in only those technical courses approved under the conditions listed below. Students must:a. Provide an ofﬁ cial transcript from the technology center that includes all essential elements to document the completed technical course(s). Essential elements of a transcript are detailed in the State Regents’ Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.b. Achieve a minimum passing grade, as determined by the accreditation, licensure, or other programmatic requirements of the State System institution, for technical course work listed on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix, clearly documented on an ofﬁ cial technology center transcript.c. Be admitted to the participating State System institution. Technical course credit earned through the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Agreement will be posted on the ofﬁ cial college transcript as a grade of “S” or “P” at the receiving institution. All technical credit awarded through the Statewide Articulation Agreement shall be appropriately identiﬁ ed by source and method on the ofﬁ cial college transcript. C.   Procedures1. A State System institution seeking approval for technical courses from an Oklahoma technology center to be included in the Statewide Articulation Agreement shall have the president submit the proposal to the Chancellor for State Regents’ consideration. After receipt of the proposed courses for articulation, State Regents’ staff will manage the content faculty review and evaluation process for the proposed technical courses to be inventoried in the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix. After review, staff will submit the faculty-recommended technical courses to the State Regents for approval. Detailed information on the technical course review process is available in the State Regents’ Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook and online.2. An institutional request for approval of technical courses from an Oklahoma technology center to be included in the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix shall contain the following information.The Undergraduate Division    17    IN-STATE/OUT-OF-STATE STATUS OF ENROLLED STUDENTS POLICY(OSRHE Policy 3.18, 4/17)3.18.1   PurposeOklahoma statute 70 O.S., Supp. 2003, §3218.2 authorizes the State Regents to establish tuition and fees charged at public institutions to in-state/out-of-state postsecondary students. This policy statement establishes deﬁ nitions, principles, criteria, and guidelines to assist institutional ofﬁ cials in the classiﬁ cation of postsecondary students as in-state/out-of-state students. Also, the policy statement should be helpful to prospective students in the determination of their in-state/out-of-state status prior to enrollment or for those out-of-state students seeking to be reclassiﬁ ed as in-state. Determination of in-state status for purposes of attendance at an institution in the state is based primarily on domicile as deﬁ ned below.Since 1890, it has been public policy in Oklahoma to provide comprehensive, public higher education opportunities for citizens to improve themselves, to upgrade the knowledge and skills of the Oklahoma work force, and to enhance the quality of life in Oklahoma generally. Therefore, residents of Oklahoma are afforded subsidies covering a portion of their educational costs at state colleges and universities.  Out-of-state students are also provided educational subsidies, although at lower levels than those provided for permanent in-state students.Out-of-state tuition waivers provide Oklahoma institutions the ability to attract and graduate out-of-state students with academic abilities and talents who contribute to the economic development, vitality and diversity of the state’s campuses. Additionally, Oklahoma institutions located near the state’s borders are especially sensitive to serving demographic areas where population, tax dollars, property ownership, etc., cross state borders frequently. Out-of-state tuition waivers allow institutions to serve the community and surrounding area to the beneﬁ t of the institution and its students without detriment to Oklahoma residents  3.18.2   Deﬁ nitions The following words and terms, when used in the Chapter, shall have the following meaning, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise:“Dependent Person” is one who is under the care, custody, and support of a parent or legal guardian.“Domicile” is a person’s true, ﬁ xed, permanent home or habitation. It is the place where he or she intends to remain and to which he or she expects to return. A person can have more than one residence, but only one domicile. Domicile has two components -- residence and the intent to remain. When these two occur, there is domicile.“Documented foreign national” is a person who was born outside the jurisdiction of the United States (U.S.), is a citizen of a foreign country, and has not become a naturalized U.S. citizen under U.S. law, but has entered the U.S. by way of legal documentation such as a visa.“Full-Time Professional Practitioner or Worker” is a U.S. Citizen or Lawful Permanent Resident who has come to Oklahoma to practice a profession on a full-time basis, conduct a business full-time, or work on a full-time basis.“Full-Time Student” is an undergraduate student enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester in an academic year or a minimum of six credit hours in a summer session. A full-a. Names of the participating technology center and the participating higher education institution.b. Name of college technical certiﬁ cate, associate in applied science degree, or technology baccalaureate degree program toward which technical credit will be awarded.c. Titles of modules and number of clock hours, courses, or programs for which approval is sought with the equivalent college technical course(s) to include college course title, course description, student learning outcomes, and academic credit. Forms are available in the State Regents’ Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook and online.3. State System institutions may require external validation of technology center coursework for college credit through third party entities, such as the American Council on Education or programmatic accreditors recognized by the USDE.D.   Reporting and Publications1. Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix for each academic year will include course title, course description, and student learning outcomes of the State System institution’s course, and the equivalent technology center course title(s) and clock hours for each approved articulated technical course. This matrix is maintained online, reviewed at least annually, and updated as needed by the State Regents through a college faculty-driven process detailed in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.2. The State System institutions participating in the Statewide Articulation Agreement will provide faculty with expertise in the content area to validate the collegiate content and rigor of any technology center course listed on the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix.3. All publications and advertisements regardless of medium will note which college is awarding the transfer credit. Additionally, all publications and advertisements must adhere to the consumer protection requirements (see Accreditation and State Authorization policy) that prohibit State System institutions or technology centers from making misleading, deceptive, and/or inaccurate statements in brochures, web sites, catalogs, and/or other media/publications. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in the nulliﬁ cation of the course(s) listed on the Statewide Articulation Agreement and the Statewide Technical Course Articulation Matrix.E.   Workshops and Standing Committee1. In collaboration with the State Director of Career and Technology Education, the Chancellor shall develop workshops to improve policy implementation, enhance cooperation, inspire innovation, and encourage the use of technology. The workshops shall include system wide representation from technology centers and higher education institutions to facilitate communication of current policy and additional needs. In addition, the standing committee of the Council on Instruction for transfer credit policy will address policy issues as needed.18    East Central Universitytime graduate student is one enrolled in a minimum of nine credit hours per semester or as required by the institution.“Home of Record” is the location where the reservist enlisted, reenlisted, or was commissioned into the military.“Independent person” is one who is responsible for his or her own care, custody, and support.“In-state” status is a classiﬁ cation for a postsecondary student who has lived continuously in Oklahoma for at least 12 months not primarily as a postsecondary student and has established domicile in Oklahoma or meets requirements associated with in-state status including sections 3.18.4, 3.18.7 and 3.18.9. Students classiﬁ ed upon admission as in-state are eligible to apply for state scholarship and ﬁ nancial aid programs.“Lawful permanent resident” is a naturalized alien who has been granted ofﬁ cial immigration status as a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. This is evidenced by a lawful permanent resident card (also called a “green card”).“Out-of-state” status means an individual does not meet in-state requirements deﬁ ned in this policy unless otherwise allowed by exceptions or provisions in policy.“Out-of-state tuition waiver” is the portion of tuition that is waived in excess of that paid by students classiﬁ ed as in-state. This is referred to as “Nonresident Tuition Waiver” in State Regents’ Fiscal policy.“Undocumented student” is a person who was born outside the jurisdiction of the U.S., is a citizen of a foreign country, and has not become a naturalized U.S. Citizen under U.S. Law and has entered the U.S. without documentation. Refer to 3.18.6“Uniformed services” means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Public Health Service.“U.S. Citizen” is a person born in the United States, a U.S. Territory or former U.S. Territory or who has been granted citizenship by the U.S. Government.3.18.3   Principles  As part of the admissions process, institutions are responsible for determining students’ in-state/out-of-state status consistent with this policy. Administrators interview students, review documentation and are in the best position to determine whether the student may be classiﬁ ed as in-state. Each institution must designate an appropriate administrative ofﬁ cial (most often the Admissions Ofﬁ cer) as responsible for administration of this policy. Clariﬁ cation and additional information including documentation examples and frequently asked questions are in the Academic Affairs Procedures Handbook.The burden of proof to establish in-state status shall be upon the student. Since residence or domicile is a matter of intent, each case will be judged on its own merit by the appropriate administrative ofﬁ cial(s) consistent with this policy. Mere assertion by a student such as checking “In-State” on the application for admission is insufﬁ cient. The appropriate administrative ofﬁ cial must review relevant documents, consider the policy principles and procedures, circumstances, and documentation to determine in-state status. While no set criteria, documentation, or set of circumstances can be used for this purpose, the principles outlined below guide the process.A.   Attendance at a postsecondary educational institution, albeit a continuous and long-term experience, does not establish in-state status. Therefore, a student neither gains nor loses in-state status solely by such attendance.B.   Students attending an Oklahoma college or university may perform many objective acts, some of which are required by law (i.e. payment of taxes), and all of which are customarily done by some out-of-state students who do not intend to remain in Oklahoma after graduation, but are situational and necessary and/or voluntary (i.e. registering to vote, obtaining a driver’s license). Such acts and/or declarations alone are insufﬁ cient evidence of intent to remain in Oklahoma beyond the college experience.C.   An out-of-state student attending an Oklahoma college or university on more than a half-time basis is presumed to be in the state primarily for educational purposes.D.   An individual is not deemed to have acquired in-state status until he or she has been in the state for at least a year primarily as a permanent resident and not primarily as a student and has established domicile. Likewise, an individual classiﬁ ed as in-state shall not be reclassiﬁ ed as out-of-state until 12 months after leaving Oklahoma to live in another state.E.   Unless residency has been established in another state, an individual who resided in Oklahoma at the time of graduation from an Oklahoma high school and has resided in the state with a parent or legal guardian for two years prior to graduation from high school will be eligible for in-state status and as allowed in 3.18.7 and 3.18.8.F.   Each spouse in a family shall establish his or her own status on a separate basis. Exceptions include the following: when an out-of-state status individual marries a person with in-state status, the out-of-state individual may be considered in-state after documentation of the marriage and proof of domicile are  satisﬁ ed without the 12 month domiciliary waiting period, and as provided in sections 3.18.7 or 3.18.8.G.   Initial classiﬁ cation as out-of-state shall not prejudice the right of a person to be reclassiﬁ ed thereafter for following semesters or terms of enrollment as in-state provided that he or she establish domicile as deﬁ ned in this policy. Institutions must establish procedures for students to appeal out-of-state status classiﬁ cation.H.   Institutions may, but are not required, to waive out-of-state tuition (also known as Nonresident Tuition Waiver) in accordance with current State Regents’ Tuition and Fees policy 4.18.5.B that allows any institution in the State System to waive a portion of the out-of-state tuition which amount shall not exceed the difference between out-of-state tuition and the amount paid by in-state students.I.     When a student transfers from one institution to another, the institution to which the student transfers is not bound by the in-state/out-of-state classiﬁ cation previously determined and may request documentation to determine the student’s in-state/out-of-state status.  The Undergraduate Division    19    3.18.4 Dependent and Independent Persons  A. The legal residence of a dependent person is the postsecondary student’s parents or the residence of the parent who has legal custody or the parent with whom the student habitually resides.  If the student is under the care of those other than the parents, the legal residence is that of the student’s legal guardian.B. In-state/out-of-state classiﬁ cations of postsecondary students with extenuating circumstances (e.g., divorced parents with joint custody when one parent or legal guardian lives out-of-state and/or claimed as a dependent on a tax return, etc.) may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Guidance for administrative ofﬁ cers charged with classifying students will be provided in the procedures manual.C. A dependent person may establish independent person status through circumstances including, marriage, formal court action, abandonment by parents, etc. To qualify, a dependent person must have completely separated from the parental or guardian domicile and prove that such separation is complete and permanent. Additionally, the individual must provide evidence that they are responsible for their housing and living expenses. Mere absence from the parental or guardian domicile is not proof of its complete abandonment. If an applicant can provide adequate and satisfactory evidence of independent status and domicile, they may be granted in-state status. D. If an independent person can provide evidence of coming to Oklahoma to establish domicile, the applicant may be granted in-state status at the next enrollment occurring after expiration of 12 months following establishment of domicile in Oklahoma.3.18.5 Documented Foreign NationalsDocumented foreign nationals may attend as postsecondary students if they have appropriate educational visas. These individuals are eligible for in-state classiﬁ cation if they become lawful permanent residents, have resided in Oklahoma for at least 12 consecutive months, and meet domicile requirements as set forth in this policy.Documented foreign nationals who are present in the U.S. with visas that allow full-time employment for extraordinary ability in sciences, arts, education, business, athletics, as an executive, manager, or specialist of a treaty nation company operating in the U.S. are eligible for out-of-state tuition waivers as long as they remain in full-time working status. Dependents of these documented foreign nationals who are lawfully present in Oklahoma based on the documented foreign national’s visa are also eligible for out-of-state tuition waivers.3.18.6 Undocumented StudentsPursuant to Title 70, O.S., Section 3242 (2007) (also known as HB1804 of the First Regular Session of the 51st Legislature), an individual who cannot present to the institution valid documentation of United States nationality or an immigration status permitting study at a postsecondary institution but who:A. Graduated from a public or private Oklahoma high school;B. Resided in this state with a parent or legal guardian while attending classes at an Oklahoma public or private high school in this state for at least two (2) years prior to graduation; andC. Satisﬁ es admission standards for the institution.Individuals who meet the above requirements are eligible for enrollment and/or out-of-state tuition waivers if that individual:1. Provides the institution with a copy of a true and correct application or petition ﬁ led with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) to legalize the student’s immigration status, or2. Files an afﬁ davit with the institution stating that the student will ﬁ le an application to legalize his or her immigration status at the earliest opportunity the student is eligible to do so, but in no case later than:a. One (1) year after the date on which the student enrolls for study at the institution, orb. If there is no formal process to permit children of parents without lawful immigration status to apply for lawful status without risk of deportation, one (1) year after the date the USCIS provides such a formal process, and3. If the student ﬁ les an afﬁ davit pursuant to subsection B. above, presents to the institution a copy of a true and correct application or petition ﬁ led with the USCIS no later than:a. One (1) year after the date on which the student enrolls for study at the institution, orb. If there is no formal process to permit children of parents without lawful immigration status to apply for lawful status without risk of deportation, one (1) year after the date the USCIS provides such a formal process, which copy shall be maintained in the institution’s records for that student.4. Any student who completes and provides the institution with a copy of a true and correct application or petition ﬁ led with USCIS to legalize the student’s immigration status shall not be disqualiﬁ ed on the basis of the student’s immigration status from any scholarships or ﬁ nancial aid provided by this state as long as the student meets the following:a. Graduated from a public or private Oklahoma high school;b. Resided in this state with a parent or legal guardian while attending classes at an Oklahoma public or private high school in this state for at least two (2) years prior to graduation; andc. Satisﬁ es admission standards for the institution.5. This policy shall not impose any additional conditions to maintain eligibility for an out-of-state tuition waiver at a postsecondary educational institution within The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education on a student who was enrolled in a degree program and ﬁ rst received an out-of-state tuition wavier and/or access to state scholarships at that institution during the 2006-2007 school year or any prior year    3.18.7   Uniformed Services and Other Military     Service/TrainingThe following section is compliant with 38 U.S.C, Section 3679(c) and 70, O.S., Section 3247.20    East Central UniversityA.   Active Uniformed ServicesThe following shall be eligible for in-state status: 1. Members of the uniformed services, along with their dependent children and spouse, who provide evidence that they are full-time active duty status of more than thirty (30) days in the uniformed services stationed in Oklahoma or temporarily present through military orders. Further, when members of the armed services are transferred out-of-state, the member, their spouse and dependent children shall continue to be classiﬁ ed as in-state as long as they remain continuously enrolled.2. Regardless of the residency of the student, dependent children or spouse of a person who is currently serving as a member of the active uniformed services of the United States on full-time active duty status of more than thirty (30) days for whom Oklahoma is the home of record.3. A person who ﬁ les with the institution within the State system at which he/she intends to register a letter of intent to establish residence in the state and whoa. is entitled to educational or training assistance under Section 3319 of Title 38 of the United States Code by virtue of a relationship to a person who is currently serving on active duty; andb. resides in the state while enrolled in the institution, regardless of the student’s formal state of residence state or the active service member’s home of record.4. Former full-time active uniformed services personnel who remain in Oklahoma after their service may retain their in-state status without the 12 month requirement if they establish domicile as deﬁ ned in this policy.B.   Discharged or Released from Active Uniformed Service  (Regardless of the Home of Record)A student who ﬁ les with the institution within the State System at which the student intends to register a letter of intent to establish residence in the state and who resides in the state while enrolled in the institution shall be eligible for in-state status (i.e., in-state tuition), regardless of the residency of the student or home of record, if the student:1. Is a person who:a. was discharged or released from a period of not fewer than ninety (90) days of active duty uniformed service, less than ﬁ ve (5) years before the date of enrollment in the course(s)concerned, andb. is pursuing a course of education with educational assistance under Chapters 30 or 33 of Title 38 of the United States Code while living in Oklahoma;2.

Improvement of Teaching and LearningFor the purpose of improving teaching and learning, each college and university shall assess students using criteria approved by the State Regents and including at least the following four categories: (1) entry level to determine academic preparation and course placement; (2) general education assessment; (3) academic program learning outcomes assessment; and (4) student engagement and satisfaction.  Assessment applies to all students including those admitted through adult admission (refer to Adult Admission in the Institutional Admission and Retention policy).  Assessment will be consistent with the HLC Criteria for Accreditation and Core Components and consistent with 3.7 Academic Program Review.  B.   Accountability and Institutional Effectiveness Assessment for accountability and institutional effectiveness should, whenever possible, be compared to external benchmarks. Data in each category of assessment will be reported to the State Regents annually and will include detailed information designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the assessments consistent with the mission and programs of the institution.  Reports may include the annual student assessment report and national assessment reports for comparing institutions and State Systems.  As institutions develop criteria and select assessment measures that demonstrate institutional effectiveness, each assessment should be coordinated and complement the improvement of teaching and learning.  Institutions should evaluate the validity and reliability of the assessments.   In recognition of varying institutional missions and student populations served, assessment for accountability and institutional effectiveness should include the institutional characteristics that produce the most meaningful comparisons and useful information for improvement. Assessment programs should also consider the needs of special populations in the  development of policies and procedures.C.   Developmental Education Certain disciplines, most notably English, mathematics, and science, build on requisite knowledge. College courses in such disciplines assume a student knowledge base gained in high school or other previous academic experiences. It is therefore imperative that students not enroll in college-level courses in the ﬁ elds when lacking that knowledge.   Students should not enroll in college-level courses, such as  history or other elective courses, without a necessary foundation in reading and writing.   Students, who can demonstrate competency in an academic ﬁ eld, even though they did not take the required course(s) in high school, will have the curricular deﬁ ciency waived. Such students will be allowed to enroll in the respective discipline’s college-level courses. Within the State System, the community college tier is ofﬁ cially designated as responsible for developmental education.  Although institutions in other tiers, with the exception of regional universities with assigned community college functions, do not have this developmental education responsibility, such institutions may also offer developmental education.   Developmental education at all state system institutions shall be fully supported through student fees. 3.20.4  Entry Level Assessment and Course Placement  A.  High School Curricular Requirements The State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy lists high school curricular requirements for admission to programs leading to associate in arts, associate in science, associate in applied science, and baccalaureate degrees.  The policy requires institutions admitting students with one or more curricular deﬁ ciencies to provide the means to satisfy those deﬁ ciencies and to remediate these deﬁ ciencies within the ﬁ rst 24 college-level credit hours attempted.  Students with curricular deﬁ ciencies in English, mathematics, reading, and science who fail to demonstrate adequate curricular competence through a minimum ACT subject score or institutional secondary assessment will be required to participate in developmental education designed to remedy the deﬁ ciency. Students must achieve a competency equivalent to a “C” or better to remove the deﬁ ciency.   Students with a curricular deﬁ ciency in history or citizenship skills, who present an ACT reading subject score at or above the speciﬁ ed level or who score at the designated level on any approved secondary institutional reading assessment instrument, may be admitted as regular admission students. These students will be required to complete an additional three-hour college-level history or citizenship skills course to make up the high school deﬁ ciency.  Students with an elective deﬁ ciency may also be admitted as regular admission students as speciﬁ ed in the State Regents’ Institutional Admission and Retention policy, but will be required to take an additional three-hour collegiate course in an elective subject area(s).  These course placement requirements will be communicated regularly to high school students, parents, school teachers, counselors,and administrators for the purpose of informing them of the proﬁ ciency levels in the basic academic skills areas needed to be adequately prepared for college-level work. B.  Basic Academic Skills Requirements Student competency may be demonstrated and deﬁ ciencies removed in basic academic skills English, mathematics, reading and science—through the use of State System ACT scores in the four subject areas of science, English, and mathematics and reading, or high school assessments predictive of college course success. Institutions may, within their approved assessment plans, establish higher standards by requiring additional testing of those students meeting or exceeding the minimum ACT subject test score requirement. The system ACT subject scores are reviewed by the State Regents and communicated annually. Each institution will use measures for course placement as approved by the State Regents.   Students scoring below the ACT subject score minimum level will be reviewed with additional information, as approved by the State Regents, to determine the level of readiness for college-level course work or successfully complete developmental education in the subject area.

East Central University’s policy addresses these four areas and is designed to assist faculty and students in promoting student success in achieving their academic goals and to aid the university in the improvement of teaching and learning.Entry-Level Assessment:All students who enroll at East Central University as ﬁ rst-time entering freshmen and transfer students who enter the university with six or fewer semester credit hours attempted are required to participate in entry-level assessment.  In addition to complying with published ECU admission standards, participation in entry-level assessment may include other activities such as taking placement tests, completing student surveys, and contributing to other entry-level assessment-related activities.Mid-Level (General Education) Assessment:All students who enroll at East Central University as freshmen or transfer students without an associate of arts or associate of science degree are required to participate in mid-level assessment of General Education.  Participation in mid-level assessment may include such activities as taking assessment tests, participating in student orientation, developing portfolios, completing student surveys, and contributing to other mid-level assessment-related activities.Assessment of the Major:During their junior and senior years, all students are required to participate in major ﬁ eld assessment.  Participation in major ﬁ eld assessment may include such activities as enrolling in capstone courses, taking assessment tests, developing portfolios, completing student surveys, and contributing to other assessment-related activities of one’s major.Student Satisfaction Assessment:Using surveys, focus groups, and other assessment-related activities, assessment of student satisfaction encompasses two areas:  current student and alumni satisfaction with student services, such as housing, food services, ﬁ nancial aid, extra-curricular activities, library, bookstore, advising and counseling, etc.; and alumni satisfaction with overall quality of their education at East Central University.FEES AND FINANCIAL AID BASIC COSTS FOR A SEMESTER(Oklahoma resident student, full-time)Resident Tuition and Activity fees and charges: Undergraduate: estimate includes tuition, mandatory, and semester feesPer academic semester (15 sem. hrs.) .....................................$3,489.50(Semester fees include $25.00 auto parking permit, $2.00 I.D. card, $50.00 Health Care Fee and $7.50 Academic Records Fee) Books and supplies (approximate) ...........................................$400-600Room and board (double occupancy/20 meal plan) $2675 per semesterResident Tuition and Activity fees and charges:  Graduate: estimate includes tuition, mandatory, and semester feesPer academic semester (9 sem. hrs.) ........................................$4221.50 (Includes $25.00 auto parking permit, $2.00 I.D. card, $50.00   Health Care Fee and $7.50 Academic Records Fee) Books and supplies (approximate) ...........................................$400-600Room and board (double occupancy/20 meal plan) $2675 per semesterbegin remediation of basic academic skills deﬁ ciencies during the ﬁ rst semester and continue until prepared for college-level course work in the respective subject area.  Institutions are responsible for directing students to complete developmental education within the ﬁ rst year or 24 college-level credit hours.  The president or the president’s designee may allow exceptions on an individual basis for students with extenuating circumstances.  All exceptions will be reported to the State Regents.     C.  Concurrently Enrolled High School Students High school students wishing to enroll concurrently in college courses must meet the designated score in English, mathematics, and science or they will not be permitted enrollment in the corresponding college subject area. A student scoring below the established ACT score in reading will not be permitted enrollment in any collegiate course (outside the subjects of science, mathematics, and English). Concurrent enrollment students are not eligible for secondary institutional assessments and may not enroll in developmental education.  D.  Adult Students Institutions must assess adult students’ academic competence through the evaluation of basic academic skills or curricular requirements appropriate.  This must be done through participation in the ACT or the review of additional information.  If indicated by the course placement information, adult students must be remediated consistent with this policy.  Institutions are responsible for directing students to complete developmental education within the ﬁ rst year or 24 college-level credit hours. E. Course Placement and Developmental Education Evaluation  Institutional entry level assessment programs should include anevaluation of past academic performance, educational goals, study skills, values, self-concept and motivation. Student assessment results will be utilized in the placement and advisement process. Tracking systems for evaluation of institutional assessment programs must be in place. The purpose is to validate that information from assessment and course completion is used to evaluate, innovate and strengthen programs in order to accelerate student achievement and development. The data collection activities must be clearly linked to instructional improvement efforts.  These data will be included in the annual assessment report. F. Limits The president or the president’s designee may allow a student who has been regularly enrolled to continue to enroll in college-level course work in addition to developmental coursework beyond the 24 college-level credit hour limit, provided the student has demonstrated success in the college-level coursework. Such exceptions must be appropriately documented and a report made available upon request. The Undergraduate Division    23    The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, have established the following charges for East Central University; these charges are subject to change by the Regents at any time:  1.

For pre-licensure students, most prerequisite courses must be completed before the beginning of the junior year.  Some general education courses can be taken during the junior year, but because of the intensive clinical experiences that are taught during the senior year, it becomes challenging to schedule additional courses.  Students should complete their general education requirements during the ﬁ rst six semesters of the program. Because of the complex and integrated nature of the nursing curriculum, it is strongly recommended that students visit with a nursing advisor as soon as possible to plan their course of study.  Students are required to make an appointment with their assigned nursing advisor before pre-enrolling each semester.  Requirements for Admission to the Pre-Licensure Nursing Program  Applicants to ECU’s Nursing Program must also be admitted to the University before enrolling in nursing courses.

STEP 2 - After notiﬁ cation of provisional acceptance return letter of intent and proof of:• Up-to-date immuniztions• Tuberculin/PPD skin test clearance or equivalentApplied Mathematics/ Pre-Actuary ConcentrationThe Applied Mathematics/ Pre-Actuary Concentration prepares the student for entry into the job market as an applied mathematician, an actuarial trainee, for a career in ﬁ nance, or for entry into a graduate program in applied mathematics, actuarial science, statistics, ﬁ nance or quantitative management science. COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAMThe curriculum has been designed using guidelines published by the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM).  These courses will give the student excellent training in the scientiﬁ c and technical areas of computing and also provide the preparation necessary to pursue graduate work in this ﬁ eld.  SCHOOL OF NURSING Assistant Professor and Interim Director DuncanInstructors Curtis, Dilday, Heck, Hoffpauir, Ollila, Powers, Reed, Saidleman, ShalverLecturer Gray, ScottNursing is an exciting and rewarding profession and professional nurses are highly valued in today’s health care system.  Nurses are recognized for their skills, judgment and decision-making ability.  Research has shown that there is a direct correlation between successful patient recovery and the number of baccalaureate nurses providing care.  A baccalaureate degree in nursing from ECU is the stepping stone to an array of practice opportunities including advanced practice nursing, nursing education, middle-and upper-level management and advanced degrees. ECU graduates are heavily recruited by health care facilities throughout the central plains and the southwest.  Enrolled nursing students are eligible for a number of grants and scholarships.  Awards available through the nursing program include the Carlock Scholarship, the Nursing Alumni Award, the Pfeffer Award, and the Francis W. and Elizabeth Schmelling Award.  As nursing majors, students also become eligible for Physician’s Manpower Training Awards, Indian Health Service Scholarships, and a number of awards/scholarships from Oklahoma and Texas hospitals.  Financial Aid will provide a list of available assistance upon request. Also refer to the ECU Foundation website https://www.ecok.edu/administration/foundation. The mission of the School of Nursing is an integral part of the overall mission of ECU.  It includes offering a high quality baccalaureate nursing program to provide south central and southeast Oklahoma with accessible, professionally delivered nursing care.  The goal of the program is to prepare students for the practice of professional nursing in a variety of settings and areas. For more information, please contact the School of Nursing at ECU or view the website at ecok.edu/nursing.The School of Nursing offers the Bachelor of Science with a major in Nursing degree to pre-licensure (these are students who are not already registered nurses) students at its campus sites in Ada and Durant.  Pre-licensure students complete an eight semester program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science with a major in Nursing.  Graduates who meet the Oklahoma state requirements for licensure, including a clear criminal background check, are eligible to apply to write the National Council Licensing Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX, RN) to become a Registered Nurse.  During the ﬁ rst three semesters in the major, students work toward completion of general education requirements and nursing support courses.  Unlike most pre-licensure baccalaureate nursing programs that offer only Health and Sciences    89    • Background check• Drug screen• CPR certiﬁ cation• OSHA certiﬁ cate• HIPAA certiﬁ cate• Other signatory formsAttainment of the basic requirements for admission to the nursing program does not guarantee admission to the program.

The award year begins with the fall semester and ends with the summer term.  The FAFSA may be completed online at www.fafsa.gov.  Students needing help to complete the online FAFSA should contact the ECU Educational Opportunity Center at (580) 559-5684 or the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce at (580) 559-5243 for assistance.  Additional documents, if required, will be requested at the time the result of the federal application is received.  East Central University does not prohibit the granting of ﬁ nancial assistance because of race, color, or national origin. Application Deadlines - students should complete their ﬁ nancial aid application and pre-enroll as early as possible.January 1 Apply as soon as possible after this date for the next academic year, which begins with the fall semester.March 1 Students should have a completed ﬁ nancial aid application on ﬁ le in the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce for priority application processing for the next academic year beginning with fall.

June 1 Financial aid ﬁ le should be complete and accurate to ensure fall ﬁ nancial aid will be ready for the initial aid disbursement. GRANTS Federal and State grants are available to qualiﬁ ed students having substantial ﬁ nancial need.  Federal Pell Grants Federal Pell Grants are awarded to eligible undergraduate students who show ﬁ nancial need based on a standard formula.  Funding is not limited by the number of students who apply.  The Federal Pell Grant is the only type of aid that may cover less than half-time enrollment (1-5 hours).  Students are limited to 12 semester of full-time enrollments.Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) SEOG awards are made to undergraduate students who have exceptional ﬁ nancial need.  Funding is limited and priority is given to students who receive a Federal Pell Grant and who complete the application process, including providing requested documentation to the ECU Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce earliest.  The maximum SEOG at ECU is $800.00 for the award year.Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grants (OTAG) OTAG is a grant administered by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.  The funds are disbursed by East Central University.  Recipients must be an undergraduate student and be enrolled at least half-time to receive OTAG.  To be considered for OTAG, the FAFSA must have been ﬁ led prior to March 15 and the applicant must be an Oklahoma resident.  Tribal Higher Education GrantsThe Tribal Higher Education Grants are available to tribal members.  Application for grants is made through the Tribal Headquarters with which the student is afﬁ liated.

Vocational Rehabilitation Program A student who has an impairment to employment because of a physical or an emotional impairment may apply for payment of tuition and other services to the Division’s District Ofﬁ ce on campus which is located at 1001 E. 14th St.  The phone number is 332-0178.  In order to be eligible for this assistance, a student’s impairment must be medically established, and their vocational objective must be approved by the appropriate counselor of the Division.LOANSSeveral types of loans are available to help students pay for school.  Loans must be repaid with interest. Loans require entrance counseling prior to disbursement of funds and exit counseling prior to graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time. Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments. The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester. Students must repay loans even if they do not complete their education, are not able to get a job after completing the program or are dissatisﬁ ed with the education for which they paid. The Health Care Act of 2010 (H. R. 4872) eliminated the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) and requires schools to participate in the William D. Ford Direct Lending Program.  Since the federal government will be the only lender, new and former loan borrowers (prior to Summer, 2010)  will need to complete a Direct Loan Master Promissory Note and Direct Loan Entrance Counseling to continue receiving student loans.  Students may also want to consider loan consolidation to avoid multiple payments to more than one lender. Students should refer to the Direct Loan tab and the loan consolidation tab on the ﬁ nancial aid webpage for more information. Lions-Alumni Student Loan Fund and Don Clawson Student Loan FundThis fund is designed to aid students with short-term, low-cost loans to meet emergency expenses.  The loan is to be repaid prior to pre-enrollment for the following semester.Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program (subsidized and unsubsidized)The Stafford Loan is a low interest loan guaranteed and funded by the federal government.  The federal government pays the interest on the subsidized Stafford loan while the student is in school and during the grace period.  The student is responsible for the interest on the unsubsidized Stafford loan.  Repayment normally begins six months after graduating, leaving school or dropping below half-time.  The monthly repayment amount depends on the total amount borrowed, the length of the payment period and the repayment option chosen.The amount of the loan is determined by the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce, and depends on several variables such as expected family contribution as determined by the FAFSA, other types of ﬁ nancial assistance which the student receives and grade level.  East Central University may not deliver the ﬁ rst installment of Stafford Loan proceeds to a ﬁ rst-year undergraduate student who has not previously received a Stafford Loan until 30 days after the ﬁ rst day of classes (the 31st day).  Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments.  The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester.  To qualify for a Stafford Loan, undergraduate students must be enrolled in at least 6 hours and graduate students must be enrolled in at least 4 hours. All summer loans are disbursed in two payments, one in June and the second in July.The Undergraduate Division    25    Federal Direct PLUS ProgramThis loan may be available to families of dependent students when other types of aid do not meet their needs.  It is a loan program similar to the Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program.  Repayment normally begins 60 days after the last loan disbursement for the loan period.  However, if a deferment applies, borrowers do not begin repaying any principal until the deferment ends.  The lender will run a credit check on all PLUS Loan borrowers.   The student must be enrolled in at least 6 hours for the parent to qualify for a PLUS loan.STUDENT EMPLOYMENT Many students are employed by area businesses.  Others work on campus either as regular student employees or as participants in the Federal Work Study program.  Student employment allows students to earn money to pay for educational costs while providing valuable job experience.  Money is earned hourly and paid monthly.  ECU offers a variety of community service employment opportunities funded through the federal work-study program.  The University assists students in securing this work.  Further information may be obtained from the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce, or Employment Services. VETERANS ADMINISTRATION EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS/PROGRAMS East Central University is approved for students who are eligible for a variety of Veterans Administration beneﬁ ts.

The Student Handbook contains the East Central University Student Code of Conduct.  The Handbook is available online at www.ecok.edu/student-development/student-development-home/ecu-student-handbook. Since the Catalog explains the operation of and gives the rules of the University, the student will refer to it often.  Usually a student follows the degree plan as stated in the catalog effective at East Central University at the beginning of his or her continuous enrollment.  A continuous enrollment shall mean assignment of an East Central University grade on the transcript of at least one semester hour, semester after semester—excluding summer—until graduation.  Additional rules to the above policies are:a. If the student leaves East Central University and returns during a later term, continuous enrollment at any accredited institution will also be acceptable.  b. If general education requirements are completed under an East Central University Catalog at the time of the student’s enrollment, the new general education requirements need not be met. c. If the student is in attendance at East Central University when changes are made in the requirements for three components, the general education program and/or the major and/or the minor program of studies, he or she may follow the requirements of either component in effect at his or her ﬁ rst enrollment or he or she may choose to follow the requirements of any successive catalog provided that he or she is in continuous enrollment.  d. If a student is suspended by the University for academic reasons, he or she may return under the original catalog within a year.  e. In cases not covered by the above rules, the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs, in consultation with the student, will determine which catalog will be in effect for that student’s graduation.  Any changes imposed by law or policies by governing regulatory boards or agencies become effective at the date speciﬁ ed regardless of continuous enrollment or provision stated above.  East Central University would in no case be obligated to offer courses only for a student to meet degree requirements under a previous catalog.  The Schedule, published each semester, gives vital information about the current term. A student may become familiar with East Central University by reading this chapter and by referring to other parts of the Catalog, and to the Schedule.  Additional help in becoming familiar with the University is given at the Freshman Advisement and Enrollment to beginning freshmen (students with 6 or fewer attempted credit hours, excluding remedial [0-level courses] or pre-college work and excluding credit hours accumulated by concurrently enrolled high school students). This session occurs at times indicated in the Schedule.  All beginning freshmen will be required to successfully complete new student orientation immediately prior to their ﬁ rst semester of enrollment and  Environmental Health LaboratoryD.

UNIV 1001," Freshman Seminar in their ﬁ rst semester of enrollment.   East Central University has four undergraduate schools and colleges and a School of Graduate Studies.  The undergraduate schools are as follows:  the Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business; the College of Education and Psychology; the College of Health and Sciences; and the College of Liberal Arts and Social Sciences.  The rules and procedures of the School of Graduate Studies are given in the section of the Catalog Chapter 1607 - Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP): REAP was established as a part of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005. It is a new DOD education beneﬁ t program designed to provided educational assistance to members of the Reserve components called or ordered to active duty in response to a war or national emergency (contingency operation) as declared by the President or Congress. This new program makes certain reservists who were activated for at least 90 days after 9/11/2001 either eligible for education beneﬁ ts or eligible for increased beneﬁ ts.  http://www.gibill.va.gov/beneﬁ ts/other_programs/reap.htmlDISBURSEMENT POLICIES   Student aid eligibility is computed to the maximum amount possible in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines and the availability of funds.  In the event that this amount does not cover all costs, the student must pay the balance from some other source.  This aid may not be used for deposits, physical exams or any other fees that are due prior to enrollment.  East Central University has no obligation to make this aid available until the student is properly admitted and enrolled.Awards for the fall and spring semesters are normally made at the same time.  One-half of the total aid for the school year will be made available in the fall semester and one-half in the spring.  Awards for summer school are made late in the spring semester.  A separate summer aid application is required.  The summer aid application may be obtained in the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce when summer enrollment begins.If the student has been awarded for the fall and spring and does not attend the fall semester, the award will be cancelled for both semesters unless the student speciﬁ cally requests that aid for the spring be continued.  This will be done if funds are available on the date of request.  In addition, if the student drops below half-time, the second semester Stafford Loan must be cancelled and the student must reapply.If the student withdraws during the fall term, the award will be cancelled for the spring term.  If the student wishes to return to school for the spring or summer term, the student should contact the Financial Aid Ofﬁ ce to have the application re-evaluated.  East Central University may not deliver the ﬁ rst installment of Stafford Loan proceeds to a ﬁ rst-year undergraduate student who has not previously received a Stafford Loan until 30 days after the ﬁ rst day of classes (the 31st day).  Loans awarded for a single semester must be disbursed in two payments.  The second payment must occur after the midpoint of the semester.  All ﬁ nancial aid funds are credited to the ECU Bursar account and refunds are disbursed through Higher One. Students are required to activate the ECU Tiger Card and may choose either an ACH transfer (direct deposit to a currently existing bank account) or open a Higher One account. Students need to carefully review their options before making a selection.  Although the ACH transfer may take slightly longer depending on the policies of their bank, certain transaction fees may apply to the Higher One account and $500 is the maximum cash withdrawal per day from any ATM. Students may contact the Controller or Bursar if they have questions pertaining to the ECU Tiger Card. The initial disbursement each semester occurs approximately two weeks following the end of the 100% refund period (10 class days for fall and spring).  After the initial disbursement each semester, funds are disbursed twice a week as they are received.  First time loan recipients who are freshmen must wait until the 31st day of classes to receive their loan funds.  Oklahoma Tuition Aid Grant (OTAG), Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), Oklahoma’s Promise, etc., are disbursed when received from their respective agencies.The Undergraduate Division    27    27    East Central UniversityCOURSE IDENTIFICATION   Department course offerings are listed in their respective school sections of the Catalog.  The courses offered in a particular semester or term are listed in the Schedule.  Many departments regularly post a list of courses to be taught within a few terms in the future.   A course preﬁ x indicates the department offering the course.  The ﬁ rst digit of a four-digit course number indicates the class level (0 is pre-collegiate; 1 is freshman; 2 is sophomore; 3 is junior; 4 is senior; 5 is graduate).  The last digit of a four-digit number indicates the credit.   Freshman Seminar* B.

The digits 499 (undergraduate) and 599 (graduate) at the begin-ning of a course number indicate a course of individual study (directed individual study on a special subject or problem).   A prerequisite course is one in which a student must earn credit before enrolling in another particular course.  A corequisite course is one in which a student must enroll concurrently while enrolled in another course.  The course description (a brief description following the number and title) indicates any prerequisite or corequisite for a course.  With the permission of the instructor, a prerequisite or corequisite may be waived.  Concurrent Graduate Study  See School of Graduate Studies - Admission Categories for details.labeled the same.  The undergraduate schools and colleges are made up of departments (for example, the Art Department and the Biology Department), which offer courses in their own academic ﬁ elds.A course meets a speciﬁ c number of clock hours each week throughout a semester (Fall or Spring semester) or summer session.  A regular semester meets for sixteen weeks.  A summer session meets for eight weeks.  Occasionally courses are offered as intersession or accelerated courses.  Dates and times of those courses which meet less than a full term are noted in the Schedule.  When a student makes a passing grade in a course, he or she earns the appropriate semester hour(s) of credit.  During a regular semester, a lecture course will meet 50 minutes per week for each hour of credit being granted.  Laboratory courses will meet a minimum of 120 minutes per week for each hour of credit.  Class periods during shorter terms and sessions will be adjusted proportionately.As a student accumulates hours of credit, his or her classiﬁ cation changes.  A student is a freshman if he or she  has earned 0-29 semester hours, a sophomore if he or she has earned 30-59 hours, a junior if he or she has earned 60-89 semester hours, or a senior if he or she has earned 90 or more semester hours.  A student is a post-graduate student if he or she has earned a bachelors degree but has not earned graduate credit.  A graduate student is one who has earned at least a bachelors degree and who earns graduate credit.Most semester hours earned will apply toward a bachelors degree.  Some semester hours apply toward general education requirements (courses required by the university prior to graduation which give a broad background in a variety of subject areas) while others are in the student’s major (a ﬁ eld of intense specialization) or minor (a ﬁ eld of less intense specialization) areas.  Additional courses taken to complete degree requirements are called elective courses.  Some majors require minors and some do not.  Students should refer to major requirements for speciﬁ c graduation requirements.Lower-division courses are generally taken during a student’s freshman and sophomore years and are listed as 1000-2000 level.  Some freshmen may also be required to take pre-collegiate level (0-level) courses during their ﬁ rst year of attendance.  Upper-division courses are generally taken during a student’s junior, senior, or postgraduate years and consist of 3000-4000 level courses.  During the freshman and sophomore years, the student usually takes general education courses and decides on a major and minor.  During the junior and senior years, the student usually takes a greater number of classes in the major and minor areas.  Graduate students will enroll in graduate courses numbered as 5000 level.  With the approval of the instructor, a senior having earned more than 99 semester hours credit may enroll in a 5000 level course.  These courses, if taken for graduate credit, may not apply on a bachelors degree.  Seniors, however, may not enroll in an individual study course on the graduate level.  5000 level courses must be taken for graduate credit if the student holds a bachelors degree.A student plans his or her course load each semester with the help of an advisor.  An advisor is an instructor in the student’s major area who assists in planning the student’s schedule each semester.  Should a student be pursuing two majors, he or she should have an advisor in each area.  The student is responsible for keeping both advisors informed on degree plans from each major.  Each student is fully responsible for meeting the requirements of the university.  He or she must plan his or her own course load to suit his or her own program and goals.  The student should consult the assigned advisor at appropriate times for help with and approval of his or her plans.  To aid in the planning process, at the end of each semester the Records Ofﬁ ce makes available the grades and hours a student has earned.  When he or she becomes a junior, the Records Ofﬁ ce will prepare an ofﬁ cial degree requirement check sheet at the student’s request.REGISTRATION, COURSE LOAD, AND OVERLOAD REGISTRATION Information concerning registration is published in the Schedule.  Although advisors assist students and grant enrollment clearance, each student is responsible for the correctness of his or her own course load and for seeing that it suits his or her own program.  Before registering, a student should be familiar with all degree requirements.A student may register late but no later than the ﬁ rst week of a semester, the ﬁ rst week of a summer session, or the ﬁ fth class day of a half-semester course.  Deadlines for registering in a class with an atypical schedule are determined proportional to those for a full term.  Registration policies for intersession courses are unique.  Speciﬁ c details may be found in the Schedule. A student may not be registered at both East Central University and another institution at the same time without prior approval from each institution.  Overload regulations apply to students enrolling on more than one campus. COURSE LOAD AND OVERLOAD APPROVAL  An undergraduate student should register each semester or term in a course load which meets his or her needs.  Minimum loads are required for veteran’s beneﬁ ts, student loans, sports eligibility, and so forth.  Although an undergraduate student is usually considered a full-time student if he or she takes a load of a minimum of 12 semester hours in a semester or 6 semester hours in a summer session, the normal load is 15 or 16 semester hours in a semester or 8 or 9 semester hours in a summer session.  This load, regularly taken, will enable a student to 28    East Central UniversityTAKING COURSES AND EARNING CREDIT Given below are the ways in which a student may earn, validate, or transfer credit toward a degree or a certiﬁ cate.  1. Taking a Regular Course  A student ordinarily earns credit toward a degree by selecting regularly scheduled courses.  These courses are taught in classrooms on the campus or at approved off-campus locations.  2.  Taking an Individual Study Course  A superior student may pursue special academic interests in consultation with an instructor outside the conventional class structure.  The department chairperson and dean must approve this study, which ordinarily is from one to four semester hours for each course.  Not more than nine semester hours of Individual Study courses may be applied toward graduation without approval by the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs.  3. Taking a Private Instruction Course  A student may earn credit for private instruction taken in selected ﬁ elds from a regular faculty member with the approval of the chairperson and dean of the department offering the course.  4. Taking a Special Study Course (Advanced Standing Credit)  I. Policy and Procedures  A. Students eligible to receive advanced standing credit at East Central University must be enrolled at East Central University as a resident student.  B. Advanced standing credit awarded to a student must be validated by successful completion of 12 or more semester hours at East Central University before being placed on the student’s ofﬁ cial transcript.  Successful completion is determined to be a 2.0 retention GPA. C. Work taken at proprietary schools, secondary vocational-technical schools, institutions offering clock-hour work, other noncollegiate institutions, institutions other than accredited institutions of higher education or experiential learning, must be evaluated and validated through examination or proﬁ ciency testing on a course by course basis by East Central University.  The name of the sending institution shall not appear on the East Central University transcript.  D. Learning experiences gained in other than accredited institutions of higher education must be validated on a course by course basis at East Central University by one of the following mechanisms:  1. Standardized national tests especially designed for establishment of credit, such as the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Advanced Placement Program (APP) of the College Entrance Examination Board, may  be used by institutions to establish advanced standing credit.  Only a subject examination will be considered by East Central University.  General exams are not accepted for credit.  ACT scores will not be used to establish advanced standing credit.  2. Institutionally prepared examinations, including performance testing, will be used by East Central University.  A list of courses in which institutionally prepared examinations are regularly available will be maintained by the East Central University Records Ofﬁ ce.  This list will be composed of courses submitted to the Records Ofﬁ ce by the Dean of each School or College.  This list will be revised at least annually.  Departments may also make special guidelines or brochures consistent with these standards to inform students what courses are available by advanced standing examination and how to apply for such credits.  3. Advanced training credit awarded for military training schools shall not exceed the criteria and recommendations contained in publications of the American Council on Education especially designed for that purpose.  East Central University reserves the right to evaluate military credit on a course-by-course basis.  4. Advanced standing credit awarded for business and industrial, labor union, governmental agencies and other noncollegiate learning experiences, fulﬁ ll the graduation requirement of 124 semester hours in 8 semesters or the equivalent.  A student may register for as many as 20 semester hours in a semester or 10 semester hours in a summer session without special permission.  To register for an overload of as many as 24 hours in a semester or 15 in a summer, the student must have the approval of the Dean of his or her major.  Oklahoma Regents allow no more than 24 semester hours credit granted for a fall or spring semester, or 15 hours for a summer term without special approval from the university president or his or her designee.  It should be noted that status for Financial Aid may be different from status for enrollment.   CHANGING A COURSE LOAD OR FORMALLY WITHDRAWING FROM THE UNIVERSITY   Changing a course load or withdrawing from the university results from the student’s formally processing the transaction.  See the ECU Schedule for speciﬁ c procedures and deadlines.  A student may add a full semester course to his or her course load within the ﬁ rst week of classes in a semester, the ﬁ rst week of classes in a summer session, the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve class days of a half-semester course, or the ﬁ rst three days of a half summer session course.  Deadlines for adding a class with an atypical schedule are determined proportional to those for a full term.  A student who formally withdraws from a course through the twenty-eighth day (ﬁ ve weeks plus 3 days) of a summer session or the eleventh week of a semester receives the guaranteed grade of “W” for the course.  One who withdraws after the guaranteed “W” deadline through the seventh week of a summer session or the fourteenth week of a semester may receive “W” for the course if passing, “F” if failing.  The assignment of an “F” is optional to the instructor.  Time limits for withdrawing from a class meeting less than a full term are proportional to those for a full term.  An instructor may withdraw a student from a course he or she teaches if the student’s attendance or performance becomes unsatisfactory.  A student who stops attending one or all of his or her classes without formally withdrawing will receive an “F” in each unﬁ nished course.  If a student’s attendance or performance becomes unsatisfactory, he or she may be required to withdraw from the University. The Undergraduate Division    29    shall not exceed the criteria and recommendations contained in publications of the American Council on Education especially designed for that purpose.  East Central University reserves the right to evaluate for credit on a course-by-course basis.  5.  Credit for experiential learning, including but not limited to military occupational specialties (MOS), may be granted only on a course-by-course basis in instances in which an approved academic unit at East Central University determines, on the basis of appropriate validation (i.e., not based simply on the presentation of experience), that the credit is  equivalent to a course offered by East Central University.  E. Validation procedures used should: 1. be weighted in objectivity versus subjectivity to the extent that external evaluators would reach the same conclusion given the materials reviewed; 2. specify competencies sought to establish credit; methods such as comprehensive papers or structured comprehensive oral examinations with competency based questions should be used. F. Credit may be earned by advanced standing examinations and applied to a degree program subject to meeting the residency requirements of East Central University which is 30 semester hours and subject to the availability of established procedures  to validate a course.  Credit earned by advanced standing will not count toward meeting the 30 semester hours residency requirements at East Central University.  G. East Central University shall require a minimum score as prescribed by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education for national examinations and a grade level of C or better for examinations constructed at East Central University in order to record credit in a particular subject.  H. East Central University will award advanced standing credit only in those courses which are taught at East Central University.  The neutral grade of pass (P) will be utilized to designate advanced standing credit.  All credit earned through advanced standing examinations will be designated as such on the transcript.  I. Charges for administration and recording of departmen-tally administered advanced standing examinations shall be at the rate of $5 per semester-credit-hour.  Charges for administration and recording of nationally developed advanced standing examinations shall be at the rate es-tablished by the national testing agency for the particular test in question.  No other charges shall be made for the administration or recording of advanced standing credit.  J. Advanced standing credit, once recorded and validated at East Central University, is transferable on the same basis as if the credit had been earned through regular study at East Central University.  Advanced standing credit recorded and validated at other accredited institutions of higher education will be accepted as if the credit had been earned through regular study at the awarding insti-tution.  K. Advanced standing credit will not be considered as part of the regular study load for the semester or term in which the credit is recorded.  L. No graduate credit will be granted by advanced standing examinations at East Central University. M.  East Central University will administer advanced standing examinations only in those academic disciplines which are taught at East Central University.  A student is not eligible to receive advanced standing credit in any course unless he or she is eligible to enroll in the course at East Central University; no student may take the advanced standing examination in any course in which he or she already has credit.  No student will be permitted to repeat an advanced standing examination.  II. Compliance With Policy   This policy is in compliance with the Standards of Education relating to advanced standing credit established by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.  5. Taking an Educational Tour Course    On occasion, the University provides educational tours as special features of the academic program.  These tours, at times, are entirely within the continental United States, and, in some instances, they involve travel and study in foreign countries.  They are planned and conducted in a manner to make them soundly educational and wholesomely recreational.  Generally they are directed by instructional departments of the University, and they provide for earning credit appropriate to the time spent and the educational opportunities afforded.  Costs to the students are kept at a minimum.   6. Taking a Course via Electronic Media  A student may earn credit for courses delivered electronically at East Central University or at one of the approved off-campus locations.  East Central University, having both receiving classrooms and transmitting studios, is a participating member of OneNet, the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education statewide instructional and communications network.  This two way video and audio instructional method allows institutions to share the best available faculty and courses via Instructional Television. A student may also earn credit for courses delivered in a web-based environment over the internet. All Oklahoma State Regents’ and institutional policies, standards, and guidelines for on-campus instruction apply to electronic instruction with the exception of course meeting time as deﬁ ned in the State Regents’ Academic Calendar Policy. 7. Auditing a Course   An applicant must qualify for admission to enroll in an audited course.  A student earns no credit for auditing a course.  An audit student may attend class only as an observer; he or she may not take any examinations.  A student may audit a course if he or she does not plan to take it later for credit.  Changing class status either to or from audit status must be done prior to the last day to enroll in the course.  Fees for a class being audited are the same as if the class were being taken for credit. 8. Duplicating a Course   A student earns no credit for taking a course substantially equivalent to a course for which he or she has already received credit, regardless of whether he or she intended to duplicate work. 30    East Central University9.  Taking Courses in Military Science   A student may apply a maximum of 24 semester hours of military science courses toward a degree.  10.  Earning Credit for Military Service   Veterans or current service members may be granted credit for basic training, for formal service school courses, and for approved college-level examinations passed while in military service.  Generally, the credit is granted in accordance with the recommendations of the American Council on Education (ACE).  However, evaluation practices at East Central University supersede ACE recommendations.11.  Earning Credit for Prior Learning Students may earn credit for knowledge gained through prior learning experiences.  Credit is granted based on the evaluation of a portfolio prepared by the student.  Prior approval  for portfolio preparation must be obtained.12.  Transferring Credit for the General Education           Requirement (Articulation Policy)   East Central University participates with certain other Oklahoma institutions in a reciprocal transfer agreement (the Regents’ Articulation Policy).  By virtue of this agreement a student who has completed his or her general education requirement and received an Associate degree in Arts or Science at one of the participating Oklahoma two-year colleges may fulﬁ ll East Central University’s general education requirement by transferring his or her credit to East Central University.  Transferring credit for general education does not eliminate or otherwise affect any of the following East Central University requirements:  (1) prerequisites; (2) speciﬁ c requirements in majors, minors or related work in these areas; (3) the requirements for teacher certiﬁ cation.  Not included in this transfer arrangement are vocational and technical two-year college programs and other programs not primarily designated for students intending to transfer to bachelor’s degree programs. 13.  Transferring Credit from Accredited Institutions   A student may transfer from approved institutions up to 94 semester hours of approved credit toward a degree or a program.  No more than 64 hours of the transferred credit may be earned at two-year colleges.  No more than 32 hours of the transferred college credit may be earned at one-year colleges.  A student may transfer credit from a two-year college after he or she has earned 64 hours or from a one-year college after he or she has earned 32 hours only if the credit is in courses that are equivalent to lower-division courses at East Central University.   14.  Transferring Credit from Unaccredited Institutions   After completing at least twelve hours at East Central University with a grade average of “C” or higher, a student may ask to have credits transferred from unaccredited institutions.  If his or her request is ap-proved, he or she may transfer credit generally on the basis of credit ac-ceptance policies described in “Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions,” a publication of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Ofﬁ cers.  Credit is evaluated on a course-by-course basis and is usually granted only toward speciﬁ c requirements in the general education, major and/or minor areas. 15.  Oklahoma Statewide Transfer Matrix Students transferring to East Central University may obtain infor-mation concerning course equivalencies of courses being transferred to ECU.  A course transfer matrix approved by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education and a transfer matrix established speciﬁ -cally for East Central University may be found by going to the website  www.ecok.edu then clicking on Admissions/Transfer Student, then ECU Transfer Matrix.16.  Failing a Course   A student earns no credit for a course in which he or she makes “F” or “WF.”  See the State Regents’ Grading Policy regarding grade point average calculation.17.  No Degree Credit (Not Applicable on Degree)  Because of high school or previous course work completed, a course may be recorded “not applicable on degree” credit.  Such courses will be counted as part of the course load in a term or semester, and in the cumulative and retention grade point averages.  The course will not be counted on degree requirements.GRADING POLICY (OSRHE POLICY 3.12, 9/14)ATTENDANCE AND CONDUCT REQUIREMENTS; RETENTION RATES; HONOR ROLL; AND HONORS GRADUATION3.12.3   Grading TermsThe following types of grading entries with respective deﬁ nitions will be used for institutional transcript notations:Grades used in the calculation of the Grade Point Average (GPA)  GradeABCDFNoteExcellentGoodAverageBelow AverageFailureGrade Point Per Hour43210A.  Other SymbolsI An incomplete grade may be used at the instructor’s discretion to indicate that additional work is necessary to complete a course.  It is not a substitute for an “F”, and no student may be failing a course at the time an “I” grade is awarded.  To receive an “I” grade, the student should have satisfactorily completed a substantial portion of the required course work for the semester.  “I” grades must be changed by the instructor within one year from the end of the semester in which the “I” was assigned or they will re-main as a permanent “I” and not contribute to the student’s GPA.  Prior to fall 1993, an “I” grade became an “F” if the work was not completed in the required time frame. For students who are members of the active uniformed military service, refer to Leave of Absence (3.12.3.B).  AU Audit status is used for the student not interested in ob-taining a course grade, but who is enrolled to get course content knowlegdge.  The allowable time to change an enrollment status from audit to credit will be established by each institution but may not exceed the institution’s add period and must be consistent with the State Regents’ add period, which is deﬁ ned as the ﬁ rst two weeks of a regular semester/term and the ﬁ rst week of a summer semester/term.  Students who change their enrollment status from audit to credit must meet institutional admission/retention standards as set by the State Regents.  The allowable time The Undergraduate Division    31    to change an enrollment status from credit to audit will be established by each institution, but will not exceed the institution’s last date for withdrawal from classes.  An AU is GPA neutral.W An automatic withdrawal grade of “W” is issued when a student initiates a withdrawal during the institution’s allowable withdrawal period.  An institution’s withdrawal period for an automatic “W” shall begin after the tenth day of classes in the regular session and the ﬁ fth day of classes in the summer term and shall not exceed 12 weeks of a 16-week semester or, in general, not exceed three-fourths of the duration of any term.  (These are maximum lim-its.  The State Regents encourage institutions to establish shorter limits.)  For any drop or withdrawal accepted after this deadline, a “W” or “F” will be assigned depending upon the student’s standing in the class and the institution’s stated withdrawal policy.  If an “F” grade is assigned, it is calculated in the student’s GPA; the “W” grade is GPA neutral.WF  Withdrawal Failing.  This grade may be given if a student is failing when he or she formally withdraws from a course within the prescribed time. (Discontinued beginning Fall 1993.)AW  Administrative Withdrawal may be assigned by the Ofﬁ ce of Academic Affairs or Student Affairs to indicate that a student has been “involuntarily” withdrawn from class(es) after the institution’s drop-and-add period for disciplin-ary or ﬁ nancial reasons or inadequate attendance.  Such withdrawals must follow formal institutional procedures.  Administrative withdrawals are GPA neutral.S-U/P-NP  An institution may use the grades “S” or “U” and “P” or “NP” for speciﬁ ed courses or may allow students to elect an “S/U” or “P/NP” option under circumstances speciﬁ ed by the institution.  The “S” and “P” are grades neutral in-dicating minimum course requirements have been met and credit has been earned.  The “S” and “P” grades may also be used to indicate credit earned through advanced standing examinations.  The grades of “U” and “NP” indicate that a student did not meet minimum requirements in a course designated for “S/U” or “P/NP” grading.  While all four grades, “S, U, P, N/P” are GPA neutral, they are counted in the total number of attempted hours for retention and the total number of attempted and earned hours for graduation.P-F An institution may use Pass-Fail as an option for students in speciﬁ ed courses.  The Pass grade indicates hours earned but does not contribute to the GPA.  The Fail grade is an “F” and is calculated into the GPA.N An “N” grade may be used by an institution to indicate that the semester grade was not submitted by the instructor by the appropriate deadline.  The “N” grade must be replaced by the appropriate letter grade prior to the end of the subse-quent semester.  The “N” grade is GPA neutral.B.  Leave of AbsencePursuant to Title 70, O.S., Section 3248, State System institutions shall grant a leave of absence, which shall not exceed a cumulative ﬁ ve (5) years, to a student who is a member of the active uniformed military services of the United States and called to active duty. The student shall be eligible to:1. Withdraw from any or all courses for the period of active duty service without penalty to admission status or GPA and without loss of institutional ﬁ nancial aid. (for refund of tuition and fees refer to Budget and Fiscal policy 4.18.4.I);  or2. Receive an “I” for any or all courses for the period of active duty status irrespective of the student’s grade at the time the “I” is awarded; provided, however, that the student has completed a minimum of ﬁ fty percent (50%) of all coursework prior to being called to active duty and the student completes all courses upon return from active duty. The student’s admission status and GPA shall not be penalized and the student shall not experience loss of institutional ﬁ nancial aid. 3.12.4   Grade Point AveragesThe GPA is used to determine a student’s eligibility to remain enrolled or graduate from an institution.  Activity courses and forgiven course work are not calculated in GPA.  This GPA may be used to determine ﬁ nancial aid eligibility, admis-sion to graduate or professional programs, or for graduation honors.The cumulative GPA includes grades for all course work, including activity courses and forgiven course work.  The use of the cumulative GPA on transcript is optional, but it may be used to determine ﬁ nancial aid eligibility, admission to gradu-ate or professional programs, or for graduation honors.Remedial/developmental courses, audited courses, and courses in which the grades of I, W, AW, S, U, P, NP, N and X are given are not calculated in the retention/graduation or cumulative GPAs.  Institutions may calculate and include on student transcripts additional GPAs such as semester, transfer, institutional, combined, etc.3.12.5 Remedial/Developmental CoursesRemedial/developmental courses shall be coded as zero-level and collegiate-level credit may not be awarded for the completion of these courses.  Remedial/developmental courses may be graded “S-U” or “P-NP” or letter graded at the discretion of the institution.  Regardless of the grades awarded, remedial/developmental courses are not calculated in the retention/graduation or cumulative GPAs.3.12.6 Academic Forgiveness ProvisionsCircumstances may justify a student being able to recover from academic problems in ways which do not forever jeopar-dize the students academic standing.  Academic forgiveness may be warranted for currently en-rolled undergraduate students in three speciﬁ c circumstances:  A.  For pedagogical reasons, a student will be allowed to repeat a course and count only the second grade earned in the calcula-tion of the GPA under the prescribed circumstances listed below.B. There may be extraordinary situations in which a student has done poorly in up to two semesters due to extenuating circum-stances which, in the judgment of the appropriate institutional ofﬁ cials, warrants excluding grades from those semesters in calculating the student’s GPA.C. A student may be returning to college after an extended absence and/or under circumstances that warrant a fresh aca-demic start.32    East Central UniversityStudents may seek academic forgiveness utilizing the follow-ing institutional procedures.  A student may receive no more than one academic reprieve or renewal in the academic career, and only one option (reprieve or renewal) can be used.  The repeated courses provision may be utilized independent of reprieve or renewal within the limits prescribed below.  All institutions will conform to the repeated courses forgiveness provision.  Institutions may offer students academic reprieve or academic renewal as detailed below.  Institutions that grant academic reprieve and/or academic renewal must submit an annual report to the State Regents.D.  Repeated CoursesAll State System institutions are required to offer the repeated courses provision.  A student shall have the prerogative to repeat courses and have only the second grade earned, even if it is lower than the ﬁ rst grade, count in the calculation of the GPA, up to a maximum of four courses but not to exceed 18 hours, in the courses in which the original grade earned was a “D” or “F.”  Both attempts shall be recorded on the transcript with the earned grade for each listed in the semester earned. The Explanation of Grades section of the transcript will note that only the second grade earned is used in the calculation of the GPA.  If a student repeats an individual course more than once, all grades earned, with the exception of the ﬁ rst, are used to calculate the GPA.  Students repeating courses above the ﬁ rst four courses or 18 credit hours of “Ds” or “Fs” repeated may do so with the initial grades and repeat grades averaged.E.  Academic ReprieveOffering academic reprieve for students is optional for all State System institutions.Academic reprieve is a provision allowing a student who has experienced extraordinary circumstances to disregard up to two semesters in the calculation of his or her GPA.A student may request an academic reprieve from State System institutions with academic reprieve policies consistent with these guidelines: 1.  At least three years must have elapsed between the period in which the grades being requested reprieved were earned and the reprieve request;  2. Prior to requesting the academic reprieve, the student must have earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher with no grade lower than a “C” in all regularly graded course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding activity or performance courses; 3. The request may be for one semester or term of enrollment or two consecutive semesters or terms of enrollments.  If the reprieve is awarded, all grades and hours are included during the semester(s) for which a reprieve has been requested.  If the student’s request is for two consecutive semesters, the institution may choose to reprieve only one semester; 4. The student must petition for consideration of academic reprieve according to institutional policy; and  5. All courses remain on the student’s transcript, but are not calculated in the student’s GPA.  Course work with a pass-ing grade included in a reprieved semester may be used to demonstrate competency in the subject matter.  However, the course work may not be used to fulﬁ ll credit hour requirements.F.   Academic Renewal  Offering academic renewal for students is optional for all State System institutions. Academic renewal is a provision allowing a student who has had academic trouble in the past and who has been out of higher education for a number of years to recover without penalty and have a fresh start.  Under academic renewal, course work taken prior to a date speciﬁ ed by the institution is not counted in the student’s GPA.A student may request academic renewal from State System institutions with academic renewal policies consistent with these guidelines: 1.  At least ﬁ ve years must have elapsed between the last semester being renewed and the renewal request;  2. Prior to requesting academic renewal, the student must have earned a GPA of 2.0 or higher with no grade lower than a “C” in all regularly graded course work (a minimum of 12 hours) excluding activity or performance courses; 3. The request will be for all courses completed before the date speciﬁ ed in the request for renewal; 4. The student must petition for consideration of academic renewal according to institutional policy; and 5.  All courses remain on the student’s transcript, but are not calculated in the student’s GPA.  Neither the content nor credit hours of renewed course work may be used to fulﬁ ll any degree or graduation requirements.3.12.7  Reporting Academic StandingA.   Retention Standards and Requirements  Each student’s transcript will list the student’s retention/graduation GPA and may also include the cumulative GPA and will denote each semester when a student is placed on academic probation or is academically suspended from the institution.B.   Transcript Notations The student’s academic transcript should be a full and accu-rate reﬂ ection of the student’s academic career.  Therefore, in situations which warrant academic forgiveness, the transcript will reﬂ ect all courses in which a student was enrolled and in which grades were earned, with the academic forgive-ness provisions reﬂ ected in such matters as how the  GPA is calculated.  Speciﬁ cally, for those students who receive aca-demic forgiveness by repeating courses or through academic reprieve or renewal, the transcript will reﬂ ect the GPA exclud-ing forgiven courses/semesters.  The transcript may also note the cumulative GPA which includes all attempted regularly graded course work. The Explanation of Grades section of the transcript will note the courses and semester(s) reprieved or renewed.  Institutions will include a  legend developed by the State Regents and consistent with this policy which deﬁ nes the grading symbols listed on the student’s transcript to the reader.The Undergraduate Division    33    Posting a Grade Faculty members are not required to post ﬁ nal grades.  If a faculty member chooses to post grades, safeguards must be taken in order to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.   Appealing a Grade  The University believes students should be given the opportunity to meet with instructors and department chairman to resolve issues concerning assigned grades.  Student grade appeals are not intended to interfere with the instructor’s right to determine the evaluation process and to perform that evaluation.  They are intended for instances that deviate from the basic understanding of how grades are to be assigned.  Students wishing to appeal a grade should ﬁ rst discuss the grade with the instructor.  If the student is still dissatisﬁ ed and believes there are circumstances that merit an appeal of grade, the student should discuss the issue with the department chair and, if necessary, the dean.  If further appeal is requested, information can be obtained on the process from the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs and/or designee.    A grade appeal must be initiated within one calendar year of the semester in which the grade was issued, (i.e., a fall semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next fall semester, a spring semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next spring semester, and a summer term grade must be initiated before the end of the next summer term).Grade Point Average  Grade point numerical values are: A is 4; B is 3; C is 2; D is 1; F is 0; WF is 0; and I is 0.  Incomplete grades assigned prior to Fall 1993 were computed as F in grade point average calculation.  Incomplete grades assigned Fall 1993 or later are disregarded in ﬁ guring a grade point average.  A grade point average is computed by multiplying the grade points earned in each course by the semester hours of that course, adding the results for each course, and dividing the total by the total credits attempted.  A student shall have the prerogative to repeat courses and have only the second grade earned, even if it is lower than the ﬁ rst grade, count in the calculation of the GPA, up to a maximum of four (4) courses or eighteen (18) hours, not to exceed eighteen (18) hours, in courses in which the original grade earned was a “D” or “F.”  The ﬁ rst attempt shall be recorded on the transcript with the earned grade.  The second course with its grade will be listed in the semester earned.  The EXPLANATION OF GRADES section of the transcript will note that only the second grade earned is used in the calculation of the retention and graduation GPAs.  If a student repeats an individual course more than once, all grades earned, with the exception of the ﬁ rst, are used to calculate the retention and graduation GPAs.  Students repeating courses above the ﬁ rst 4 courses or 18 hours of “Ds” or “Fs” repeated may do so with the original grades and repeat grades averaged.  The ﬁ gure calculated is then rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.  For example, 1.594 is 1.59, and 1.595 is 1.60.  The grades “P”, “N”, “AU” and “W” are disregarded in ﬁ guring a grade point average.  (NOTE:  This East Central University policy is based on the State Regents’ Grading Policy and is subject to review and modiﬁ cation by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.) Transferring Grades  A transferred grade other than A, B, C, D, F, and WF has a value as close as possible to the one assigned by the institution where it was earned.  A grade from an institution using a different grading system is given the value of a comparable grade at East Central University. Attendance Requirements  Individual instructors determine the degree that tardiness and absence from class affect a student’s grades and his or her ability to continue attending their classes.  Makeup work, if it is permitted, also is done under conditions set by the instructor. Instructors notify students of their policies in each of their courses at the beginning of each semes-ter or term.  Conduct Requirements  Students are expected to abide by the laws and norms of society, the rules of the University, and the rules issued by the Regional University System of Oklahoma board (see Student Handbook).English Proﬁ ciency Requirement for FacultyInstructors at East Central University are required to meet mini-mum English Proﬁ ciency standards.  The Oklahoma State Legislature requires all public schools to establish and abide by a set of standards.  East Central University’s policy is printed in the Faculty Handbook.  If a student feels a complaint should be ﬁ led in reference to an instructor’s English Proﬁ ciency, he or she may do so in the Ofﬁ ce of the President of the University.Retention RatesUpon request, prospective and enrolled students may receive from the University a description of retention rates in terms of East Central University’s enrollment patterns and types of students. Deans’ and President’s Honor Rolls  The names of undergraduate students doing exceptional academic work are published each semester and are entered on the permanent honor rolls.  To be eligible for this honor in a particular semester, a student must complete at least twelve regular-graded semester hours (grades of A, B, or C), must meet the minimum GPA requirement, must have earned no grade lower than “C” that semester, and must not have received an “I” in that semester.  If he or she earns a grade point average of 3.3 or higher that semester, his or her name is placed on the Deans’ Honor Roll.  If he or she earns an “A” in all courses that semester (4.0 GPA), his or her name is placed on the President’s Honor Roll.  Graduating with Honors A bachelors degree candidate with a total grade point average and an East Central University grade point average, will receive the following achievement status: Levels of Academic Achievement 1. Graduating with Academic Achievement (3.5 - 3.79) 2. Graduating with High Academic Achievement (3.8 - 3.99) 3. Graduating with Highest Academic Achievement (4.0) Averages are rounded to the nearest one-hundredth.34    East Central UniversityLIBRARY, AUDIOVISUAL RESOURCES, COMPUTER LABORATORIES, COMPUTER USE POLICY, WRITING CENTER, HIGH SCHOOL MEETS, INTERNATIONAL STUDENT PROGRAM AND SERVICES, GLOBAL EDUCATION PROGRAM, NATIONAL STUDENT EXCHANGE PROGRAM, AND ACADEMIC SUCCESS CENTERLinscheid Library  The East Central University Library dates from the founding of the institution in 1909.

As such, we “search” for illegal sharing of music or videos and block the users’ account and access to our network if found. • All behavior and activities prohibited by University policy.The password of any individual violating any of the above provi-sions may be voided and future access to the network may be denied pending a review and hearing by the Ofﬁ ce of Academic Affairs.  All individuals denied access to the network may appeal the decision to the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs.  The decision of the Vice President will be ﬁ nal.Computer Laboratories  Student access and use of a variety of computer applications is an important part of East Central University campus life.  Computer laboratories are available for course work for enrolled students.  These labs have ﬂ exible hours and frequently have a person available to offer assistance.  One of the features that comes with enrollment at East Cen-tral University is individual access to the campus computer network.  Graduation  A student planning to graduate must ﬁ le an electronic degree application by the dates published in the Schedule.  Students qualifying for two degrees during the same semester must make two separate applications.  Students receiving two majors but only one degree will apply once.

International Student Program and ServicesThe Ofﬁ ce of International Student Program and Services (ISPS) provides core services to international students, visiting scholars, faculty, and academic departments at East Central University.  ISPS provides advice, information, and referrals on matters such as immigration regulations, US employment authorization, taxation, ﬁ nancial matters, and educational concerns. ISPS provides admission assistance and advising for F-1 students, as well as for other visa holders, non-US citizens, and naturalized citizens.  In conjunction with the University’s Global Education Program, ISPS assists in the recruitment of students from a variety of foreign countries and administers the transfer of international students in accordance with the University’s strategic enrollment plan.  Students can receive assistance with problems related to social and personal adjustments to a new culture, as well as practical matters related to living in the United States through the Ofﬁ ce of ISPS. Lastly, ISPS represents the concerns and needs of international students to the University community. Students, visitors, and employees can connect to our ofﬁ ce through in-person advising, phone and e-mail, attending programs, receiving e-mail announcements, and by visiting our website.  Global Education ProgramHaving an understanding of different ethnic groups and their cul-tures, philosophies, and traditions is vital to being successful within the business, technological, or political arena in today’s global world. To help East Central University students gain such experience ﬁ rst-hand and to develop cross-cultural competencies, partners in higher educa-tion  from throughout the world are actively sought in order to develop student and faculty exchange programs along with other educational connections. ECU’s students also have an opportunity to travel and study internationally through a number of exchange programs with the University’s sister institutions in France, Russia, and Ukraine, as well as with partners in Wales, Spain, China, and other countries of the world.

Located in the Spencer Administration Building, the Center also provides assessment testing and College Level Placement (CLEP) testing. The Honors Program embodies high ideals of academic excellence through which students are provided challenging college experiences and enriched opportunities.  Honors students are nurtured through vibrant and distinctive seminar-type classes which are mature in scope, content and student application.  An Honors course does not accom-plish this by simply increasing the quantitative workload beyond that expected of a non-honors student, but by establishing an environment of scholarly interchange between students and faculty.The Honors Program is coordinated by the Honors Board which is composed of ﬁ ve faculty members, the Honors Director,  the Provost/Vice-President for Academic Affairs, The Honors Student Association faculty sponsor, and one student.  This governing board determines student admission standards and establishes policy for the Honors Pro-gram.  Students may qualify for admission in a number of ways:1. Incoming students with a high school GPA of at least 3.5 and a composite ACT score of at least 26 are invited by the Honors Board to apply for admission to the Honors Program. Students whose scores do not meet these criteria may apply for special consideration. Each application will be considered on a case-by-case basis.  2. Continuing students who have demonstrated a high level of skill, talent, and intellect in pursuit of college credit and who have a minimum overall Grade Point Average of 3.3 or higher are also invited to aply for admission to the Honors Program.36    East Central UniversityStudent Honor Societies  Alpha Chi National Honor Scholarship Society  Juniors and seniors having a cumulative grade point average of 3.5 or higher are eligible to apply for membership in this society.

Most of the regularly enrolled students are eligible for these various honors.  Formal presentations are made each spring in a special awards assembly. S. C. Boswell Professor  The S.C. Boswell Memorial Charitable Trust was established by Sara Boswell and Jane Boswell Maher to “attract and hold outstanding faculty members” in the Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business.  The trust provides an annual stipend to the S.C. Boswell Professor, and funds the S.C. Boswell Lecture Series.  These lectures, which are on current topics in business, are open to students, faculty, and the com-munity.Oscar L. Parker Center for the Advancementof Ethical Standards in Business and SocietyIn 1988 a trust agreement was entered into with East Central Uni-versity establishing the Oscar L. Parker Center for the Advancement of Ethical Standards in Business and Society as a ﬁ tting and lasting memorial to Oscar L. Parker, a highly respected educator, businessman, college administrator, and civic leader of Ada, and an active supporter and long-time employee of ECU.  In addition to creating the Center and providing a yearly operating budget, this endowment also established the Oscar L. Parker Professorship at ECU.  The holder of this professor-ship acts as Director of the Center.The overall purpose of the Parker Ethics Center is to provide a fo-rum for the presentation of issues involving business and societal ethics of interest to the business and academic community, as well as the gen-eral public.  The Director acts as spokesperson for the Center and serves in the capacity of speaker and presenter to civic organizations, high school assemblies, and other organizations on relevant ethical issues.  In addition, the Center sponsors an annual workshop or conference on the subject of ethical standards in business and society, and houses a small library for studies of ethical issues by students and faculty.

All University personnel are expected to cooperate with authorized public health ofﬁ cials in resolving threatening situations which may arise.  Recent events have brought attention to numerous communicable diseases including AIDS, H1N1 Flu, bacterial meningitis, mumps, measles, and rubella.  Critically important is an increasingly large body of information that clearly demonstrates that AIDS is not transmitted by any form of casual interpersonal contact.  The causative virus is actually surpris-ingly fragile, and does not survive and multiply in the air, on inanimate objects, or on environmental surfaces.  It does not swim across pools or ﬂ y.  Medical research studies in households and schools have dem-onstrated convincingly and repeatedly that the risk of transmission of AIDS is exclusively that of intimate sexual contact, mother to child, shared needles and that transmission in an ordinary academic, domestic, or work setting does not occur.  It is known that HTLV-III is present in the blood of most people with AIDS and AIDs related illnesses, and in some who are healthy carriers; thus, exposure to contaminated blood by sharing needles is dangerous.  That many Americans continue to believe that AIDS can be acquired from a drinking glass, toilet seat, or one’s casual companion undoubtedly reﬂ ects not just misinformation, but fear.Current knowledge thus indicates that college and university students or employees with AIDS, AIDs related illnesses, or a positive HTLV-III antibody test do not pose a health risk to other students or employees in a usual academic or residential setting.  The Public Health Service has stated that there is no risk created by living in the same house as an infected person, caring for an AIDS patient, eating food handled by an infected person, being coughed or sneezed on by an infected person, casual kissing, or swimming in a pool with an infected person.Education and communication form the basis of the institution’s strategy for dealing with the issues raised by communicable diseases on campus.  Based on current medical ﬁ ndings and recommendations of the American College Health Association, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and the Oklahoma State Department of Health Bulletin, East Central University has established administrative guidelines and educational strategies for students, faculty and/or staff with serious communicable diseases.  The University recognizes that no single policy statement can govern every situation which may arise; thus, individual cases shall be considered on their own needs and merits.  The University will continue to develop and review guidelines, educational programs and resources to meet the needs of all its students and employees.Institutional Policy Statement and Procedure on Serious Communicable Diseases I. Campus LifeA. Individuals with a serious communicable disease should have the same rights as any other person - free of discrimination on the basis of their infection, but will comply with University policy and procedures contingent on medical recommendations.  Individuals seeking reasonable accommodations originating from a documentable disease must register with the Ofﬁ ce of Disability Services so that said accommodations may be provided. B. Housing On campus housing will be made available to persons with communicable diseases under the same conditions as applicable to any individual, but will comply with federal, state, local, and University policy and procedure in relation to the disease.  Requests by the infected individual for unique accommodations will be given every reasonable consideration, where possible, to meet the special housing needs of that individual.  Precautions will be taken on the advice of appropriate public or private health science professionals.C. Class Attendance and Laboratories Laboratory instructors, workers, and students should follow safe procedures that would prevent transmission of body ﬂ uids.  In the event of laboratory accidents that break the skin, precautions should be exercised to pre-vent transmission of body ﬂ uid.  Laboratory procedures that involve blood samples, muscle biopsies and other biological materials should be collected and handled with care using recommended procedures.  All departments should develop guidelines for laboratory procedures when dealing with communicable diseases.D. Athletic and Sports Activities Persons with communicable diseases should seek counseling concerning participation in athletic or sports activities.  Sports activities can result in bleeding or open wounds.  Individuals coming into contact with such in-juries in any way should use utmost caution.  Procedures should be developed by all departments to cover such incidents.E. Food Handling Persons involved in the preparation or serving of food or beverages should maintain current health certiﬁ cates and follow current health standard recommendations.  Persons identiﬁ ed as having a communicable disease will abide by federal, state, local, and University procedures in the performance of their duties.II. Counseling and Health ServicesA. East Central University will make all reasonable effort to provide referral for students, faculty and/or staff for counseling or health services in community and state agencies.  The Student Development Ofﬁ ce, Counsel-ing Center, Health Services and Disability Services will maintain information regarding sources of assistance available to students, faculty and staff.B. Conﬁ dentiality Conﬁ dentiality must be carefully maintained in accor-dance with all legal requirements.  The patient’s right to conﬁ dential treatment should be protected and the associated medical records should be kept conﬁ dential in accordance with existing institutional and legal require-ments.  East Central University will make all reasonable efforts to insure that such information is kept conﬁ den-tial.  In addition, other University personnel will be made aware of the necessity for conﬁ dentiality.III. Responsibility of Individual Infected with Communicable Diseases East Central University emphasizes that individuals who know they have a communicable disease have a special responsibility to protect others from this infection.  This re-40    East Central Universitysponsibility includes appropriate conduct in situations where the infection could likely be transmitted.  Behavior contrary to this responsibility may be considered as cause for disciplinary action by the University.IV. Special Needs The future may require difﬁ cult decisions concerning the rights of the individual having a communicable disease, the need for medical or psychological assistance to the infected individual, and the protection of the welfare of the larger community.  To facilitate such decision making and to provide academic counseling or health care needs, University staff members may ﬁ nd it necessary to seek the assistance of a limited number of key University personnel.  Such consultation will take place only with the consent of the student or employee involved, unless consent is refused and inaction is judged to endanger the welfare of others.  In all cases, steps will be taken to protect the identity of those involved and utilize only data pertinent to the decision making process.Student Grievance PolicyA student should attempt an informal resolution of his/her grievance with the appropriate faculty member, staff member or administrator.  If the grievance cannot be resolved at the level to which the complaint is made, it is referred to the next higher level.  The President will review lower level decisions if an appeal is made to the President.  The President may overrule any and all decisions.  Also, anyone choosing to do so may ﬁ le a grievance directly with the President; the complaint will then be processed through the administrative channels to attempt resolution prior to the taking of ﬁ nal action.Student ComplaintsStudents may ﬁ le complaints with appropriate institutional ofﬁ cers.  Normally complaints are addressed to the individual most directly involved with the complaint.  Written complaints which are signed by the student and addressed to the President, the Provost/Vice President for Academic Affairs, or the Vice President for Student Development will be shared with the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the North Central Association during on-site accreditation visits.  Individual identities will be shielded. Students may request contact information from institutional ofﬁ cers to ﬁ le a complaint with the appropriate state agency of the institution’s accrediting body.Sexual Harassment PolicySection 1.  PurposeThe Regional University System of Oklahoma Board places a very high priority on each university governed by the Board maintaining a learning and work environment free from sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment is recognized as a barrier to the educational, scholarly and research purposes of the universities governed by the Board, and will not be tolerated.  Such conduct threatens the mission of the universities governed by the Board, and threatens the careers, educational experience, and well-being of students, faculty and staff.Sexual harassment is especially serious when it threatens relationships between teacher and student or supervisor and subordinate.  In such situations, sexual harassment exploits unfairly the power inherent in a faculty member’s or supervisor’s position.  Through grades, wage increases, recommendations for graduate study, promotion, and the like, a teacher or supervisor can have a decisive inﬂ uence on a student’s, staff member’s or faculty member’s career at a university and beyond.While sexual harassment most often takes place in situations of a power differential between the parties involved, the Board also recognizes that sexual harassment may occur between persons of the same university status.  The Board will not tolerate behavior between or among members of the university community which creates an unacceptable working or educational environment.Section 2.  Deﬁ nition/Prohibited ActsNo faculty, administrative, support employee, or student of any university governed by the Board shall engage in sexual harassment.  For the purposes of this policy, sexual harassment is deﬁ ned as unwarranted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:a. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of instruction, employment, status or participation in any course, program, or other university activity;b. Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a basis for evaluation in making academic or personnel decisions affecting an individual; orc. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s work or educational performance, or of creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment for work or learning.Section 3.  Examples of Sexual HarassmentSexual harassment encompasses any sexual attention that is unwanted.  Examples of the verbal or physical conduct prohibited by Section 2, above, include, but are not limited to:a. Physical assault;b. Direct or implied threats that submission to sexual advances will be a condition of employment, work status, promotion, grades, participation in a university academic program, or letters of recommendation;c. Direct propositions of a sexual nature;d. Subtle pressure for sexual activity, an element of which may be conduct such as repeated and unwanted electronic communications or staring;e. A pattern of conduct (not legitimately related to the subject matter of a course if one is involved) intended to discomfort or humiliate, or both, that includes one or more of the following, (1) comments of a sexual nature, or (2) sexually explicit statements, questions, jobs, or anecdotes; andf. A pattern of conduct that would discomfort or humiliate, or both, a reasonable person at whom the conduct was directed that includes one or more of the following, (1) unnecessary touching, patting, hugging, or brushing against a person’s body, (2) remarks of a sexual nature about a person’s clothing or body, (3) remarks about sexual activity or speculations about previous sexual experience, or (4) exposure to sexual jokes or anecdotes, or printed or visual material of a sexual nature.g. Any instance of sexual harassment should be reported to the Director of Employment Services, Room 160, Administration Building or the Dean of Students, Room 103, Administration Building.Section 4.  University Education and Grievance Procedure RequirementsEach university governed by the Board shall promulgate and implement ongoing educational programs and grievance procedures to aid in the prevention of and response to sexual harassment complaints.  Such programs and procedures shall be drafts by each university and presented to the Board for its approval.  Each such policy shall include, at a minimum, the following components:a. A strong statement of policy prohibiting sexual harassment in both the working environment and the educational environment at the university.  Such statement substantially Bachelor’s Degrees    41    similar to the Board policy statement in Section One, above;b. The deﬁ nition of what conduct constitutes sexual harassment adopted in this policy by the Board of Regents;c. A coordinated university-wide educational program providing information regarding sexual harassment, the university’s policy against such conduct, and the rights of the persons who are the object of sexual harassment;d. A counseling program utilizing available campus resources available to both complainants and respondents;e. An informal grievance procedure designed to encourage the reporting of incidents of sexual harassment and to provide informal conciliation and resolution of sexual harassment complaints where possible.  Such procedure should, to the greatest degree legally possible, preserve the anonymity of complainants, provide for informal discussions with persons complained against, secure the conﬁ dentiality of records regarding complaints, and be completed in a timely manner;f. A formal grievance procedure ensuring due process of all parties for resolution of formal complaints transmitted in writing to the Director of Employment Services or the Dean of Students.  Such grievance procedure must provide for methods of processing such complaints which permit independent review by persons not personally affected by the particular situation at issue (such as in the case where an employee is complained about by a person working under the supervision of such employee or where a faculty member is complained about by a student in a class taught by the faculty member); andg. The alleged victim shall be permitted to have one person of his or her choosing accompany him or her throughout the disciplinary procedure.  The alleged victim and accused shall be permitted to be present during the entire disciplinary procedure (except during deliberations of the panel).  The alleged victim and accused shall have the right to be informed of the outcome of the hearing upon its conclusion by the panel.  The person alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct shall also be afforded all of the rights set forth.h. An appeal process to the university president in the event of disciplinary action imposed due to review of a formal complaint. 42    East Central UniversityBachelor’sDegreesSection III REQUIREMENTS FOR BACHELOR’S DEGREES Degrees Offered  A student who pursues one of the University’s four-year programs may earn the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Science in Education, Bachelor of Social Work, or Bachelor of General Studies.

A liberal arts education contributes to the development of informed, responsible citizens capable of promoting and maintaining a free society, and it provides individuals a foundation for making those ethical, logical, technological, and ecological decisions requisite to effective participation in such a society. MISSION STATEMENT  As part of liberal arts education that inducts students into an intellectual community in preparation for and enhancement to disciplinary majors, the General Education Program at East Central University provides students the integrated and thorough foundation needed to reﬂ ect critically on information to understand and acknowledge the diversity of life and cultures, to see the relationships among concepts, and to appreciate the interrelatedness of academic areas.REQUIREMENTS  General education requirements of the undergraduate majors are given in the chart following.  Before beginning to fulﬁ ll these require-ments, students should study the chart and the following comments:  A student should consult with his or her advisor choosing a course in a general education area offering option.  Many majors require that a student select a particular course within the list of optional courses.  A student planning to transfer as a junior or a senior to another Okla-homa institution participating in the Regents’ Articulation Policy should take, during his or her freshman and sophomore years, six hours of Eng-lish composition; six hours United States history and government; six hours of science; six hours of humanities; three hours of mathematics; at least three hours from psychology, social sciences, foreign languages, and ﬁ ne arts (art, music, dramatics); and additional liberal arts and sci-ences courses to meet the minimum total of forty-four (44) credit hours at ECU.Bachelor’s Degrees    45    General Education Requirements of the Undergraduate Divisions Minimum 44 HoursA.

For Conditional Admission, achieve a liberal arts and sciences college grade point average of 3.00 or higher in all liberal arts and sciences courses.  An applicant may also qualify for conditional admission by possessing a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution in the United States.  Conditional Admission is valid for one semester, after which the applicant must meet Unconditional Admission requirements.  NOTE: While a student is conditionally admitted, he or she may enroll for the following semester with the understanding that enrollment may be cancelled if unconditional admission requirements are not met DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Chair and Associate Professor Isaacs Professors SherbourneAssistant Professors Felts, Jones, Koch, Sharber, ThorntonInstructors Caruthers, Cunningham, Johnson, SnellThe Department of Education serves the University in three essential functions.  The ﬁ rst function is to prepare students in the three areas of specialization the department offers at the undergraduate level: Elementary Education, Early Childhood Education, and Special Education.  The areas of specialization lead to teacher licensure and certiﬁ cation in Oklahoma. The second function is to provide professional education courses which enable competent educators in all of the teacher education programs at the University.  The third and ﬁ nal function is the offering of eight options at the master’s level (see Section on School of Graduate Studies).  The graduate program prepares individuals for a variety of occupations in public schools, related positions in institutions, business, industry, or hospitals.  Each teacher certiﬁ cation program offered at East Central University is nationally accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation.  The teacher preparation program addresses both national standards and Oklahoma’s required 10 competencies.  All standards are delivered within ECU’s PRIDE conceptual framework where faculty are committed to preparing Professional, Reﬂ ective, Innovative and Dedicated Educators. Integrated throughout the program are technology standards and best practices in STEM education. These experiences are enhanced by additional workshops organized through ECU’s Institute for Math and Science Education. Students preparing to teach in secondary schools acquire a content knowledge base and competency in their respective specialty ﬁ elds to teach at the middle school, junior high, or high school level.  Special Education majors are prepared to appropriately educate children with disabilities at any grade level and in a variety of settings.  Elementary Education majors are prepared to teach in elementary, middle school, or junior high through eighth grade.  Early Childhood Education majors prepare to teach in nursery schools, kindergartens, and grades one through three.  Field experiences provide supervised interactions with public school children before and during student teaching.  All teacher certiﬁ cation programs provide academic backgrounds for students wishing to pursue graduate level education.  These advanced studies lead to an expanded professional knowledge base and set of skills which may provide access and entry into professional careers in education.  The professional careers include school administration, supervision, educational technology, library media, guidance and counseling, special education, school psychology and psychometry, and research.Elementary Education ProgramElementary Education majors develop skill and competency in educating children in grades one through eight.   The student acquires an academic foundation in language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies by completing at least twelve semester hours in each of these content areas.  Elementary Education majors expand their teaching knowledge and skills in the use of teaching methods, materials, various assessment instruments, and appropriate technologies toward meeting the educational needs of elementary students. They develop perspective and skills in planning, organizing, implementing, and evaluating learning activities and lessons.  Students also learn appropriate classroom management skills that provide a setting and climate conducive to learning and growth.Early Childhood Education ProgramStudents who major in Early Childhood Education complete courses concentrating on the development and education of young Education and Psychology    69    may appeal to the Teacher Education Committee for a hearing and submit evidence of cause for reconsideration.  Appeal procedures are available in the ofﬁ ce of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology.  Appeal, Dismissal, and SuspensionAdmission Process—AppealThe Teacher Education Committee has the responsibility for conducting due process hearings for students who wish to appeal a decision or policy regarding teacher education admission.  If an appeal is wanted, the student must write a letter to the chair of the Teacher Education Committee requesting a hearing.  Additional information concerning the process for appealing may be obtained from the ofﬁ ce of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology.  A student may appear before the Teacher Education Committee to have the application considered.Denial of Admission or Dismissal From the Teacher Education ProgramThe obligation for maintaining academic integrity, professional standards and ethics, and legal responsibilities should be considered fundamental in the preparation of future educators.  East Central University’s Teacher Education Program assumes this obligation to parents, public schools, and the State of Oklahoma.  In this respect, the Teacher Education Program will attempt to screen and deny admission or dismiss from the program those students deemed unsuitable teacher education candidates.  This is an attempt to protect public school students from unacceptable teacher education candidates.  In addition, this good faith effort will preserve the credibility and effectiveness of the Teacher Education Program in maintaining its relationship with public schools and demonstrate the program’s efforts to provide teacher candidates who are suited to teach public school students.East Central University maintains the obligation to deny admission to or dismiss from the Teacher Education Program at any time, any student whose personal conduct is deemed detrimental to:1. the welfare of students in the public schools;2. the Teacher Education Program’s effective working relationship with the public schools;3. the student’s future success in the program;4. the student’s ﬁ tness to teach;5. the Teacher Education Program’s role in training future educators; or 6. the profession of teaching.Behavior that may constitute grounds for denial to or dismissal from the Teacher Education Program includes, but is not limited to, conduct that may result in felony conviction.A student who is denied admission or who is being considered for dismissal from the Teacher Education Program for personal conduct shall be so notiﬁ ed in writing by the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology.  Such notice shall include a statement of:1. the proposed action;2. the reason(s) for the proposed action;3. the evidence supporting the alleged personal conduct in question; and4. the opportunity to appeal the proposed action to the Teacher Education Committee.The student who is denied admission to or dismissed from the Teacher Education Program who wishes to appeal this decision must request, in writing, a hearing within ten (10) calendar days of receipt by the beginning of the following semester.8.   For Unconditional Admission, in addition to conditional admission requirements, achieve a passing score at the level required by the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation for state certiﬁ cation on the Oklahoma General Education Test (OGET).After full consideration, the applicant is (a) admitted to teacher education; (b) admitted on condition; or (c) not admitted. Applicants who are not admitted may submit written appeal to the Teacher Education Committee for a hearing and reconsideration.  Appeal procedures are available in the ofﬁ ce of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology.Note: Under current Oklahoma State Department of Education regulations, candidates holding a Bachelor of General Studies degree do not qualify to receive a teaching license under the Alternative Teacher Certiﬁ cation Program.  Students should contact the Oklahoma State Department of Education for more information.Requirements for Retention and Graduation in Teacher Education  Students who are admitted to teacher education and intend to graduate from the program must maintain their eligibility while enrolled.  The Teacher Education Program has an ongoing informal evaluation, and speciﬁ ed reviews of teacher education majors regarding continued eligibility for retention, certiﬁ cation, and graduation in teacher education.  The following is the review procedure for retention:1. A continuous informal evaluation is in progress for each candidate enrolled in professional education classes.  This evaluation is accomplished by each professor being sensitive to special problems or concerns that may be noted.  If a problem or concern is observed and is considered serious enough to be a part of the student’s record, the professor will ﬁ le a formal report with the Director of Teacher Education.  This report will be the basis for a formal reevaluation of the student by an appropriate committee to determine the eligibility and suitability of the student to remain in teacher education.2. The second review in the retention program takes place as needed at the request of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology  and consists of the following three parts:  (a) the student’s grade point average will be examined, (b) the student will be formally evaluated by the professor, and (c) the student’s portfolio will be evaluated.  A student who has not maintained an overall grade point average of 2.75 or better in all college work attempted may not enroll in additional professional education courses until the grade point average is 2.75 or better.  An unfavorable evaluation by the professor will lead to a formal reevaluation of the student by an appropriate committee to determine the eligibility and suitability of the student to remain in teacher education.  A student with an unsatisfactory portfolio will not be allowed to continue in the program until a satisfactory portfolio is presented.3. The third review in the retention process occurs at the time the student applies for student teaching when eligibility for student teaching will be examined.4.

These skills are particularly critical for careers in law, government, business, teaching, medicine, as well as for success in graduate or professional school. Founded solidly in the tradition of liberal arts, the History and Native American Studies Department at East Central University emphasizes developing these skills.  Each History and Native American Studies major may, with the help of faculty, tailor a program to best match individual career and intellectual interests. The department offers degrees in History, History (Teacher Certiﬁ cation), and Native American Studies.   HISTORY PROGRAMHistory offers students the richness of past experience to comprehend more lucidly humanity’s progress and setbacks, great accomplishments and tragic failures.  Historical study teaches judgment, examines values, and explores issues and events; it uncovers the sources of creativity and stagnation during the entire course of civilization’s evolution.  The signiﬁ cance of the past and its meaning for the possibilities of the present and future become a powerful tool of analysis and interpretation.  The History program offers a wide-range of courses in United States history, European history, and World history.  A student may major or minor in history, selecting an area of concentration for either a BA or a BA with teacher certiﬁ cation.  History as a major combined with other disciplines, provides excellent preparation for a productive and meaningful personal and professional life.

Political science majors are given more of an emphasis on critical thinking and written and oral communication skills. Classes are typically discussion-based and service learning and simulations are often employed.  The legal studies program is much more applied, teaching skills that will be applicable in the law ofﬁ ce, such as legal business applications and knowledge of specialty law subjects. Most classes are based on lectures and focused projects. Both programs study the connection between law and politics and both programs are popular avenues to law school.  Paralegals may not provide legal services directly to the public, except as permitted by law. Sociology is the scientiﬁ c study of the social causes and consequences of human behavior.  An understanding of sociology is a means to an appreciation of the interaction of individuals and social groups.  The subject matter of sociology has a broad range.  It includes the study of the intimate family, as well as the hostile mob.  Crime and its causes are studied, as well as religion and its inﬂ uences.  Divisions of race and social class are included, as well as the sharing of beliefs in a common culture.  Sociology ranges from the study of work to the study of sport, from the study of the individual in society to the study of the international community, from the study of the scientiﬁ c method to the understanding gained by living in a primitive culture.SOCIOLOGY PROGRAM 118    East Central Universityand environmental justice, engage in practice-informed research and research-informed practice, engage in policy practice, engage with individuals, families, roups, organizations, and communities, intervene with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities, and evaluate practice with individuals, families, groups, organizations, and communities. Minors and Electives  In addition to the degree programs, minors are offered in Addictions, Aging Services, Criminal Justice, Human Services Counseling, Interpreting, Juvenile Justice,  Services to the Deaf, and Social Work.

For these students East Central University offers pre-professional programs in engineering, law, and several of the medical ﬁ elds.  Students in these programs have the opportunity to spend from one to three years at East Central University completing the basic entrance requirements to the professional schools.  Students interested in this opportunity should contact the appropriate advisor for their program.  A description of the basic programs and their advisor follows below.Pre-Dental HygieneThe dental hygienist is a licensed member of the oral health care team responsible for providing preventive, therapeutic and educational services for dental patients and the community.  Dental hygienist services are provided in a variety of settings including hospitals, public health clinics, schools and geriatric centers.  Basic admission requirements consist of a minimum of 60 semester hours of prescribed course work which may be completed at ECU.  The Professional program consists of 2 years of course work, clinical and practicum in a hospital or clinical setting.  For more information, contact the Department of Biology.Pre-EngineeringNo matter what branch of engineering a student wishes to enter, the program for the ﬁ rst four semesters contains mostly the same basic courses.  These include mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, English, history, and behavioral and social sciences.The pre-engineering program at ECU allows students to ﬁ ll these requirements in two years, after which they transfer to a university with an engineering school to take advanced courses in their area of specialization.  Advisors customize students’ curriculum to match the engineering school they plan to attend.  This enables them to enjoy the small classes, personalized instruction, and friendly atmosphere at ECU while receiving an excellent academic foundation for further study.  For more information, contact the Department of Physics.Pre-Law A successful career in law demands proﬁ ciency in three-skills areas:  the ability to think critically, the ability to analyze information from a variety of sources and apply that analysis to solving problems, and the ability to communicate that analysis to others.  While completion of any undergraduate degree program confers eligibility for law school, the most successful candidates often come from programs located in the Liberal Arts which emphasize mastery of these skills.  ECU offers two programs, Political Science and Legal Studies, which have proven especially successful in helping graduates attain success in law school.  The speciﬁ c choice of major (and minor), however, should be tailored to match the interests and particular needs of each student.  Please contact the Pre-Law advisor in the Department of Politics, Law, and Society for more information.Pre-PharmacyA pre-pharmacy curriculum is offered at ECU that will meet all requirements for admission to any school of pharmacy.  The curriculum requires two to three years to complete, after which the remaining four years of study must be taken at a school of pharmacy.  The courses to be taken in the two to three year segment include those in biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics, in addition to several of our general education courses such as English, history, and government.  The program is tailored to individual needs depending upon the choice of a particular pharmacy school.  For more information, contact the Department of Chemistry.Pre-Physical TherapyPhysical Therapy is a dynamic health care profession dedicated to the promotion of optimal health, prevention of disability, and restoration of physical activity following a debilitating incident.  As an active member of the health care team, physical therapists provide therapeutic services to individuals of all ages with musculoskeletal, neurological, cardiopulmonary, sensorimotor, vascular, immunological and cellular disorders or trauma.  Physical Therapy services are provided in a variety 50    East Central Universityof settings including hospitals, extended care facilities, ambulatory clinics, schools, and homes.  (The Professional program usually consists of three years of didactic and clinical courses selected in a hospital set-ting.)  A baccalaureate degree is required along with other prerequisites such as Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores and documentation of 40 hours of observation experience submitted with the application for admission to the Physical Therapy program.  (Speciﬁ c course require-ments and other admission criteria are available from the ECU Biology department.)Pre-Professional SciencesEast Central University offers all courses that are required for admission to professional schools of medicine, dentistry, optometry, chiropractic, physician’s associate or veterinary medicine.  Although the pre-professional sciences student may select any degree major, most successful candidates major in either Biology or Chemistry.  Course work must be arranged so as to complete the required work in time for the admission exams and application in your program (usually Spring of junior year).  A pre-medicine professional student may earn the bach-elor of science degree by completing three years of work in the bachelor of science degree program and one year in an accredited professional school of Medicine (M.D. or D.O.), Dentistry (D.D.S.), Optometry (O.D.), or Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.). For more information, contact the Department of Biology.Few applicants are admitted with less than a bachelors degree.  You should follow a degree track at the time you are completing the pre-professional requirements.  East Central University does offer the Bach-elors Combined Degree Program which allows the student who may be admitted to professional medical sciences school at the end of their ju-nior year to receive the bachelors degree after successful completion of the ﬁ rst year in professional school.  The requirements for this program are available from the appropriate Pre-Professional Sciences Advisor or the ECU Records Ofﬁ ce.Section V  HARLAND C.

Our vision is to be recognized as an exemplary leader in under-graduate business education, primarily preparing students for successful entrance in both the private and public sectors, to become successful entrepreneurs, and to pursue post-baccalaureate studies.Small class sizes, quality professors, and real-world focus make for an excellent option for those looking to secure a strong foundation in Business Administration. Primary general education and major core courses are completed during the ﬁ rst two years, with concentration courses completed in the ﬁ nal two years. A mix of traditional and in-novative approaches are designed to provide knowledge of the funda-mental principles, generalizations, and theories of business, delivery of effective communications, effective use of computing software, and the skills to make sound business decisions in a socially responsible and global business environment.BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION PROGRAM Entrepreneurship ConcentrationThe Entrepreneurship provides learning opportunities to assist stu-dents in developing their skills to create and run successful companies. Topics include opportunity recognition the entrepreneurial mindset, proof of concept, ﬁ nancial planning, building a brand, management and organization planning, and market planning using curriculum developed and supported by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Students in the capstone class compete for cash prizes in the Oklahoma Governor’s Cup Competition.   Finance ConcentrationThe Finance concentration provides students with knowledge and prac-tice in the application of methods and techniques used in all areas of ﬁ nance. Basic underlying ﬁ nancial theories and concepts are examined in the core courses and are reinforced and expanded in the concentration courses.  Concentration course topics include corporate ﬁ nance, invest-ments, ﬁ nancial institutions, insurance, personal ﬁ nancial planning, and real estate development. Management ConcentrationThe Management concentration provides students with the knowledge and professional skills for effective performance in both public and private sector organizations. Managerial skills for large and small busi-nesses are addressed from both a theory and applications approach. The concentration requirements include electives from upper-level business courses to provide the student with the broad-based knowledge neces-sary in the profession.The Harland C. Stonecipher School of Business is located in the  Chickasaw Business and Conference Center. The School is also home to the Wilburn L. Smith Center for Entrepreneurship and the Kellogg & Sovereign Consulting, LLC Financial Lab. Students are encouraged to join the Business Leaders Association. Students of high academic achievement will be invited to join the international honor society Delta Mu Delta. Both the Accounting Program, and the Business Administra-tion Program, are accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).DEPARTMENT OF ACCOUNTING Instructor and Chair, DoughertyInstructor Elliott, StoneInstructor and Chickasaw Endowed Professor, LeeThe primary purpose of accounting is to measure and communi-cate ﬁ nancial information about proﬁ t and non-proﬁ t organizations to interested persons.  Accounting professionals operate within a broad socioeconomic environment.  Therefore, emphasis within the account-ing program is placed upon a combination of conceptual knowledge and practical applications of accounting theory and concepts as they relate to satisfying the information needs of a disparate group of users.  The wide selection of courses in the accounting department enables the stu-dent to become familiar with such ﬁ elds as taxation, ﬁ nancial account-ing, managerial accounting, auditing, and governmental/not-for-proﬁ t accounting.       The Accounting Program prepares the student for entry level professional positions and provides the prerequisite courses for admis-sion to graduate study.  Students majoring in accounting are required to take a combination of business and accounting related courses, which enhance their knowledge of the various business functions.  Courses in computer technology and information systems, business communica-tion, management, marketing, ﬁ nance, business law, and economics are taken by all accounting majors. The Department also offers a minor in Accounting, and two certiﬁ cate programs in Managerial Accounting and Treasury Management.ACCOUNTING PROGRAMStudents graduating with an Accounting degree must complete 150 (of which 76 must be upper division) hours, including 36 hours in accounting, to comply with the educational requirements needed to sit in the State of Oklahoma for the CPA exam.

DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCES Assistant Professor TessmanInstructor LongThe Department of Family and Consumer Sciences offers a Bachelor of Science Degree with four concentrations: Retail Merchandising, Early Care, Family and Consumer Sciences Education, and General Family and Consumer Sciences.  The Retail Merchandising option is designed to facilitate completion of courses preparatory to careers in the retail world.  Required marketing classes and a ninety-hour internship help strengthen the student’s professional preparation.  The Early Care option prepares individuals for careers in the arena of early care and child development.  The FCS Education option equips one to pursue teaching careers with sufﬁ cient expertise to meet certiﬁ cation requirements and successfully complete state competency tests.  Continuing educational opportunities are available that provide for the renewal of teaching certiﬁ cates.  This option also prepares one for non-teaching positions in county extension service, industry, business, health care, and human services.  The General FCS option prepares students for the same careers as the FCS Education option, with the exception of teaching.Several courses in the Family and Consumer Sciences Department are concerned with strengthening family life and therefore are supportive electives for majors in psychology, sociology, professional programs in human services.  Service courses are provided for degree requirements in the Nursing, Early Childhood Education, and Kinesiology Departments.  Nutrition is an optional general education class available to students majoring in any discipline.  Lower-level departmental offerings are available to any ECU student.Entering freshmen who are FCS majors are invited to apply to the Family and Consumer Sciences Department for the Trease Layton Academic Award.

In addition, if there is a reasonable belief, the immediate suspension of a student is necessary because it is to be considered in the best interests of the Teacher Education Program, the public schools, or public school students; then the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology (or in the absence of the Dean, the Chair of the Education Department or designee) may suspend the student immediately from the Teacher Education Program, including ﬁ eld experiences or student teaching.  When circumstances arise indicating there is an immediate need to suspend, the student will be notiﬁ ed verbally or in a delivered message from the Dean.  The process for dismissal of a student from the Teacher Education Program will be initiated, if necessary within ﬁ ve calendar days following suspension of the student.  To the extent possible, students reinstated after the initiation of the suspension from the Teacher Education Program policy, will be restored to their previous position and status without action detrimental to their studies, progress and evaluation of their work.Requirements for Admission to the Student Teaching Semester A teacher education candidate is required to ﬁ le an “Application for Admission to Student Teaching” during the semester preceding the one in which he or she expects to do student teaching.

Fountain, VelezAssistant Professors Campbell, Harwell, Pottratz, Roberson, Roring, WilliamsThe Department of Psychology is actively involved in fulﬁ lling the three functions of a University:  Teaching, Research, and Service.  These three functions merge as professors have students participate in  research, use research ﬁ ndings and student research to enrich classes, and provide a service to the community by teaching needed skills and providing needed services.  As a behavioral science, it employs the scientiﬁ c method to greatly enhance the problem-solving abilities of people.  Further, since psychology involves the study of behavior, it enables people to understand themselves better and to understand others.  General Psychology is the course that fulﬁ lls the general studies function.  It is a general course in which the student learns the principles of behavior and how to apply these to everyday living.  The Department of Psychology provides support courses for majors in other areas.  For example, majors in elementary education, special education, nursing, and professional programs in human services take courses in psychology to develop the understanding and skills necessary to function in their professions.  The Department of Psychology provides a major ﬁ eld of study leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree.  Just as in the minor ﬁ eld of study, some students majoring in psychology do not intend to become professional psychologists.  These students may use psychology to enter professional schools such as medicine, dentistry, law, or theology.  Others use psychology as a liberal education and enter business and industry or use this knowledge and these skills to become effective parents or citizens in the communities in which they live.  Finally, of course, students choose to major in psychology because they want to go on to graduate school and make psychology their professional career.PSYCHOLOGY PROGRAMPsychology is the science of human behavior.  As a ﬁ eld, it attempts to develop technologies that will help understand the dynamics of human behavior as a means of developing a profession that will promote human welfare.  As such, the undergraduate program at East Central University prepares its students through classwork, student professional organizations such as Psi Chi, ﬁ eld trips, assisting the faculty in professional endeavors such as research and application, and close relationships with the faculty to help understand and get to know, on a broad basis, the ﬁ eld of psychology.  This training prepares the student to work at an entry level in the following areas:  mental health clinics, hospitals, counseling centers, corrections, and many other areas including being prepared to enter graduate school.The mission of the Psychology Program is an integral part of the overall mission of East Central University.  The mission of the university includes providing a number of baccalaureate, pre-professional and graduate programs.  The program addresses this goal by providing an undergraduate degree program in Psychology.  Instruction in Psychology at the undergraduate level utilizes the following formats:  lecture, video and multimedia material, ﬁ eld trips, research and library report writing, and direct hands-on experience both in the research laboratory and clinic setting.EARLY CARE CONCENTRATIONThe concentration in Early Care is an interdisciplinary program designed to prepare individuals for careers as early care education master teachers or program administrators, parent education instructors, early intervention instructors, program teachers for infants to school-age children and social services agents in child and family programs. The option is open only to individuals who have earned an associate’s degree in child development or early childhood from a partnering community college.FAMILY AND CONSUMER SCIENCESEDUCATION CONCENTRATIONPrepares students for teaching Family and Consumer Sciences in school settings.  Careers as community extension agents, 4-H leaders, nutritionist, child care professionals, test kitchen research, life style journalism, consumer affairs specialist, human service positions, and entrepreneurship are also available.GENERAL FAMILY ANDCONSUMER SCIENCES CONCENTRATIONPrepares students for all the careers listed above with the exception of teaching.  Courses in the department involve students in both lecture and laboratory experiences.  Educational enrichment opportunities are available through ﬁ eld trips, practicums, internships, student teaching, conferences, seminars, and workshops.  Graduates may pursue graduate studies, enter the labor force, or apply their family and consumer sciences education toward strengthening their personal and family life, and improving their communities.  Family and Consumer Sciences is a multi-dimensional program that offers challenge, diversity, and opportunity. DEPARTMENT OF KINESIOLOGYAssistant Professor and Chair PratherInstructors Lorance, McCarty-J., McGaha-J., McGaha-M., StowersPhysical Activity–an integral part of the educational experience– contributes effectively to a student’s general development. The Department of Kinesiology gives students the means to educate the total person for living in an enlightened society. The study of human movement is the unique content of the Kinesiology program. Choices in Wellness is the course that is offered for the general education requirement and provides students with the knowledge and skills necessary to make lifestyle choices which positively affect one’s health and well-being. The Kinesiology Department also provides support courses for other majors or teaching concentrations.    Kinesiology ProgramThe Kinesiology program prepares students for careers in the ﬁ tness/wellness profession, as well as research oriented careers. Prospective employers include health clubs, recreational facilities, hospital-based wellness programs, cardiac rehabilitation programs, sports medicine clinics, as well as preparing students for various medical professions such as: athletic training, physical therapy, physical assistant, and physician’s assistant. Many Kinesiology majors use interdisciplinary studies to prepare for working with special populations such as senior citizens or owning their own ﬁ tness business such as personal training. The coursework for this degree includes a core of courses in the broad ﬁ eld of Kinesiology concentrating on knowledge and skills necessary for appropriate exercise testing, prescription, and leadership.72    East Central UniversityPROFESSIONAL EDUCATION SEQUENCECourse HoursEDUC  2402 Survey of Exceptional Children ...........................................................................................................................................2 Child and Adolescent Psychology .......................................................................................................................................3The following courses to be taken when a sophomore or junior:EDUC  2012 Foundations of Education (To be taken in same term as  and , and   Child and Adolescent Psychology Select 11 additional hours from the following list of courses. ; Coreq.:  and admission to Teacher Education.

DEPARTMENT OFCHEMISTRY/PHYSICSProfessor and Chair MyersProfessor WilliamsAssociate Professors Crittell, McInnesAssistant Professors Bryhan, MaplesThe Department of Chemistry/Physics is comprised of two disciplines--Chemistry and Physics.  The department offers Bachelor of Science degree programs with a major and a minor in each of these academic areas.  Speciﬁ c features of each program are detailed below.CHEMISTRY  The department of chemistry offers both a major and a minor in chemistry, a major in chemistry with a biochemistry concentration, a major in chemistry for teacher certiﬁ cation, and courses needed for those wishing to teach biology, chemistry, physics, physical science, or general science at the public school level.  The department also functions as a support and service department for required courses in biology, nursing, environmental science, and allied health programs.Additionally the department provides pre-professional studies for students pursuing medicine, engineering, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, physical therapy, and medical technology.A quality program of study is made possible through small classes, opportunity for  student/professor interaction, and the unique situation of having the Robert S. Kerr Environmental Protection Agency Groundwater Research Laboratory located in Ada, OK.  Cooperative agreements with this governmental institution allow expanded opportunities for study, research,  quality analytical instrumentation, and possible student employment while at ECU. CHEMISTRY PROGRAMIn compliance with the recommendations of the American Chemical Society for curricula in undergraduate chemical education, the department offers courses in all ﬁ ve major areas of chemistry:  inorganic, analytical, organic, physical, and biochemistry.  PHYSICS   Physics is one of the most fundamental and all-inclusive of the sciences.  It is an attempt to understand the foundations of our universe through the study of motion, force, energy, sound, electricity, magnetism, thermodynamics, heat, light, and quantum mechanics.  Physics students use advanced mathematics to solve challenging experimental or theoretical problems, so they often major in mathematics as well.  The ability to analyze a problem and ﬁ nd the best possible solution is vital to success in many ﬁ elds.  As a result, physics graduates often work in such seemingly non-related areas as medicine, law, biology, business, or military science, as well as in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or industry.DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY Professor and Chair Bay Professors Biles, GilbertAssistant Professors Dudley, Howard, Moring, Nesbit, Wang The Department of Biology provides undergraduate training for students interested in the life sciences who may wish to pursue careers in this area.  Biology is a continually expanding discipline with a variety of career opportunities. The faculty and facilities of the Department permit the investigation of Biology at the subcellular, cellular, organismal, population and community level.  Courses taught in the Department emphasize scientiﬁ c principles and concepts that aid in understanding structure, function and behavior of individual organisms and how individual organisms interact within the natural environment. Several scholarships are available to qualiﬁ ed students.  Departmental scholarships include the Thomas J. McKnight Biology Scholarship and the Fred and Mary Pfeffer Scholarship.  Other scholarships are available through the Academic Scholarship Program and the East Central University Foundation. For students who plan to teach there are scholarships available through the College of Education and Psychology. There are several clubs and societies available for biology students.  The ones currently active are the Tri-Beta Club, the Pre-Denistry Club, and the Society for Wildlife and Ecological Biologists.    BIOLOGY DEGREE CONCENTRATIONThe Department of Biology offers majors in four bachelor degree concentrations.  A Bachelor of Science is designed for students who plan to become practicing biologists in industry or government, or plan to pursue a graduate degree in biology.  This degree concentration is usually chosen by those students who need pre-professional training before entering the schools of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, or other health-related professional schools.  A Bachelor of Science for Teacher Certiﬁ cation gives a prospective science teacher an appropriate academic background in biology and in the methods of teaching.  The Bachelor of Science for Molecular Biology prepares students for graduate research and/or employment in the rapidly growing ﬁ elds of biotechnology, agribusiness, industry, law enforcement, and molecular biology.  A Bachelor of Science for Clinical Laboratory Science prepares students to conduct and supervise complex medical tests, clinical trials, and research experiments; manage clinical laboratories; and consult with physicians and clinical researchers on diagnoses, disease causation and spread, and research outcomes.  This degree concentration requires three years of prescribed study on campus followed by a year of clinical training in an approved hospital School of Clinical Laboratory Science.    CLINICAL LABORATORY SCIENCE CONCENTRATION This concentration requires a minimum of ninety-four semester hours credit of prescribed study on the campus, followed by a clinical component (30 hours) which consists of a year of approved professional training in Clinical Laboratory Science.  The professional training must be done in a school of clinical laboratory science approved by the University and by the Oklahoma Consortium of Clinical Laboratory Science Afﬁ liates. Requirements for admission to the clinical component of clinical laboratory science:1. Complete the general education requirements.2. Complete prescribed science and math courses or equivalent courses.3. Complete a sufﬁ cient number of approved electives to complete the minimum requirement of ninety-four semester hours.Health and Sciences    87    management, environmental program planning, industrial food safety, disease vector control, occupational safety and health, and water resources management.  EHS Program graduates have been selected for professional positions in public health departments, private industries, state and federal environmental agencies, the United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and in private environmental consulting ﬁ rms.  In addition, the program prepares EHS majors for graduate study in a wide variety of disciplines.The EHS program is one of 31 baccalaureate programs accredited by the National Environmental Health Science and Protection Accreditation Council and has maintained accreditation since 1975. EHS majors must complete a total of 55 hours of core courses in environmental health and environmental science which includes a supervised, professional internship at an approved site.  The internship provides students with an opportunity to integrate their academic preparation with actual work experiences.  EHS majors must also complete supporting courses in biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics.  A minor is advised, but not required.DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE Professor and Chair FerdinandAssociate Professor WellsAssistant Professors Harper, Jacob, Lastrina, Lynam, Uﬁ mstev, TarverInstructor McClain  The Mathematics program offers three concentrations which leads to a Bachelor of Science degree. The curriculum is ﬂ exible and can be adapted to a variety of student interests. After completing one of the three concentrations,  program graduates typically enter the job market as certiﬁ ed teachers of secondary school mathematics, actuarial trainees, applied mathematicians in business or industry; or pursue study in graduate school leading to advanced degrees in mathematics, statistics, computer science, ﬁ nance, or management science. Some program graduates elect to pursue further study in a professional school such as law or medicine.The Computer Science degree program is designed to prepare its graduates for technical careers in various software ﬁ elds. Program graduates enjoy lucrative salaries and the opportunity to work on interesting and challenging projects upon employment in many of today’s primary industries.Computing facilities include powerful Linux-based and Windows-based terminals as well as graphics workstations. Department computers have internet access and are loaded with mathematical and statistical software packages for use in classroom teaching and student research. All four department computer laboratories are accessible during the regular and evening hours.MATHEMATICS PROGRAMGeneral Mathematics ConcentrationThe General Mathematics concentration provides preparation for the student who plans to enter a graduate program in mathematics. A student taking this concentration, in consultation with his or her advisor, should choose elective courses which meet the entrance requirements of the desired graduate program.  Teacher Certiﬁ cation ConcentrationThe Teacher Certiﬁ cation Concentration, in conjunction with professional education courses, prepares the student for teaching mathematics at the secondary level.In addition to the university’s program of ﬁ nancial aid, the department provides positions for student workers.  Several  departmental scholarships are awarded annually, and the department participates in the LS-OKAMP program awarding scholarships and research stipends for qualifying minority students.   Interested students should contact the Department Chairman for further information.PHYSICS PROGRAMAll physics students begin with Engineering Physics I and II and mathematics through Calculus II.  Advanced courses are selected to prepare them for one of four main areas: employment in physics or engineering, graduate studies in physics or engineering, the teaching profession at the secondary level, or graduate studies in medical physics. DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES Professor and Chair WeirickProfessor and Robert S. Kerr Endowed Chair SewellAssistant Professor BraunThe Department of Environmental Sciences maintains two degree programs, the Cartography Program and the Environmental Health Science Program. The Cartography program offers a major leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Cartography and the Environmental Health Science program offers a major leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Health Science. Both programs offer minors for students majoring in other degree programs.CARTOGRAPHY PROGRAMThe Bachelor of Science degree in Cartography provides graduates with the education needed to work in public or private sector positions requiring geographical and geospatial knowledge and skills.  The degree also prepares students for graduate studies in Cartography, Geography and related disciplines.Cartography majors select from one of two degree options, either a concentration in Geotechniques or a concentration in Geography.  The Geotechniques concentration places emphasis on the analytical, theoretical, and technical skills necessary for employment as a cartographer or geographic information system analyst.  These include cartography, remote sensing, geographic information systems, and global positioning systems.  This concentration also requires geography courses to enable students to apply geotechniques methodologies to real-world situations.  The Geography concentration provides a more traditional geography based education which trains students to think spatially and requires a ﬁ eld course to help students understand the job of a professional geographer. Students in either concentration must complete a minor in a related ﬁ eld.   All Cartography majors gain valuable hands-on experiences through the use of the department’s state-of-the-art Devon Energy Spatial Graphics and Analysis Laboratory.  Cartography majors receive additional experience by giving a formal presentation based upon a senior project, are encouraged to participate in professional meetings and have opportunities to complete internships with governmental agencies or industrial corporations.ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE PROGRAMThe Bachelor of Science degree in Environmental Health Science (EHS) provides graduates with the interdisciplinary education needed for professional careers in areas such as: hazardous materials 88    East Central Universityfour semesters of clinical courses, ECU has ﬁ ve semesters of clinical courses.

Upon completion the State Board of Education will issue a one-year provisional certiﬁ cate to teach in the area of mild/moderate disabilities grades Pre K-12.  GENERAL REGULATIONSCertiﬁ cates  East Central University’s Certiﬁ cation processes are overseen by The Ofﬁ ce of Educational Quality and Accountability.  “Pursu-ant to SB1797, effective July 1, 2014, the Oklahoma Commission for Teacher Preparation (OCTP) consolidated with the Ofﬁ ce of Educational Quality and Accountability (OEQA). The responsibili-ties of the OCTP, enacted by legislation HB1549 passed in 1995, remains the same, creating a competency-based teacher preparation system that would ensure competent and qualiﬁ ed teachers in every classroom. The agency assumes three primary responsibilities: the accreditation of teacher preparation programs, the assessment of teacher candidates, and the ongoing growth and development of classroom teachers across the state.”  Kinds of Certiﬁ cates  A. Early Childhood School Certiﬁ cate (Grades PK-3)B. Elementary School Certiﬁ cate (Grades 1-8) C. Elementary-Secondary School Certiﬁ cate (Grades PK-12) D.

Student grade appeals are not intended to interfere with the professor’s right to determine the evaluation process and to perform that evaluation.  They are intended for instances that deviate from the basic understanding of how grades are to be assigned.  Students wishing to appeal a grade should ﬁ rst discuss the grade with the professor.  If the student still believes there are circumstances that merit an appeal of grade, the student should discuss the issue with the department chair. A grade appeal must be initiated within one calendar year of the semester in which the grade was issued, (i.e., a fall semester grade must be initiated before the last day of the next fall semester, a spring semes-ter grade must be initiated before the last day of the next spring semes-ter, and a summer term grade must be initiated before the end of the next summer term).Any graduate applicant or graduate student with conﬂ ict other than grade appeal, and not approved by the Graduate Dean, is entitled to submit in writing the particulars of the conﬂ ict to the Chair of the Graduate Committee.  The Graduate Committee will consider and make a determination. completed within six (6) years prior to the completion of the degree, exclusive of any time spent in the Armed Forces of the United States of America.  Work completed more than six (6) years prior to comple-tion of the degree may not be counted toward the degree but may count toward professional certiﬁ cation.9. Maximum Study LoadNine (9) graduate semester hours during a semester and four (5) graduate semester hours during summer term are considered full-time enrollment.  Twelve (12) graduate semester hours during a semester and nine (9) graduate semester hours during a summer term are the recom-mended maximum study load for a graduate student.  All exceptions require the approval of the Graduate Dean.10. Certiﬁ cation CoursesTeachers and other school personnel naming ECU as their parent institution for recertiﬁ cation purposes need to obtain the approval of the Dean of the College of Education and Psychology for the credits they plan to submit for certiﬁ cate renewal.  11.

It is not a substitute for an “F”, and no student may be failing a course at the time an “I” grade is awarded.  To receive an “I” grade, the student should have satisfactorily completed a sub-stantial portion of the re-quired course work for the semester.  “I” grades must be changed by the instructor within one year from the end of the semester in which the “I” was assigned or they will remain as a permanent “I” and not contribute to the student’s GPA.Graduate students must maintain an overall graduate grade point average (GPA) of 3.0 to remain academically in good standing with the School of Graduate Studies. If the GPA falls below 3.0, the student will be placed on Academic Probation. In this status, a minimum GPA of 3.0 must be earned each semester or term. Failure to earn a 3.0 or higher wach semester or term will result in Suspension from the Graduate Degree Program.Supervision, Faculty, Personnel    193    Supervision,Faculty, PersonnelSection XII SUPERVISION, ORGANIZATION, FACULTY AND OTHER PERSONNEL    Supervision The Oklahoma State System of Higher Education, of which East Central University is a part, is directed by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, which has broad powers over the state institutions of higher education.
