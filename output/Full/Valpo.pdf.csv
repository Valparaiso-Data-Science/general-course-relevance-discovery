IN 4638,"3-6493.    4 The General Catalog of Valparaiso University is designed to describe the programs of the University and to give that information needed to guide students in the successful achievement of their academic goals. Nevertheless, the material is for information only and does not make a contract between the student and the University. Students themselves are ultimately responsible for completion of the requirements for their degrees as well as for the value they receive from University programs. The relationship between the University and its students is not custodial in nature. There is no special relationship with the University created by a student's enrollment. The University does not assume any duty toward any student that is not otherwise required by operation of law or by the terms of this catalog. In years when the GENERAL CATALOG is not published, an announcement bulletin gives information on important changes in courses, calendar, staff, program and policies. The University reserves the right to discontinue an academic program if it is deemed no longer central to the University’s mission. Separate catalogs are issued for the Law School and the Graduate School which should be consulted for details about the related programs. Statement on Equality of Opportunity Please refer to the University's "Nondiscrimination and Equality of Opportunity Policy" and its "Nondiscrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct Policy," which are available in the STUDENT GUIDE TO UNIVERSITY LIFE and on the General Council website. Graduation Rate of Entering Freshmen The graduation rate for all students entering Valparaiso University as first-time freshmen during the 2011-2012 academic year was 72.2%. This graduation rate represents the percentage of students entering Valparaiso University as first-time (i.e., new) full-time degree-seeking freshmen during the 2011 Summer and Fall semesters who subsequently were awarded baccalaureate degrees by Valparaiso University within six calendar years (i.e., through August 2017). 5 University Calendar for 2018-2019 For the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business, Engineering, and Nursing and Health Professions.

As a scholarly community it actively engages in the exploration, transmission and enlargement not only of knowledge but also of the cultural and religious heritage of human society, and it is proud to prepare men and women for professional service. This community values respect for learning and truth, for human dignity, for freedom from ignorance and prejudice, and for a critically inquiring spirit. The University aims to develop in its members these values, together with a sense of vocation and social responsibility. It holds that these values receive their deepest meaning and strength within the context of the Christian faith. These basic commitments enable Valparaiso University to graduate students whose individual achievements and aspirations are linked invariably to larger social, moral, and spiritual horizons of meaning and significance. Proud of all its alumni who have carried its values into leadership roles in their communities, the church, social institutions, the nation, and the world, it aims to continue graduating such potential leaders. A Distinctive Institution All American colleges and universities bear a family resemblance to one another as they come from a common set of ancestors in Europe and colonial America. Within that larger family, Valparaiso University belongs to a small and distinctive group. It is neither a large research university nor a small liberal arts college. At the same time that it promotes a basic liberal arts curriculum, it features strong undergraduate colleges of Engineering, Nursing and Health Professions, and Business, a professional direction lacking in the conventional liberal arts college. Conversely, the University is not a cluster of professional colleges which merely pays lip service to the liberal arts. Education in the liberal arts is the foundation of every academic program, and the College of Arts and Sciences, the largest unit in the University, carries on many vital programs of its own. This combination of liberal and professional studies of such variety within an institution of modest size is rare in American higher education. Broad enough in curriculum and in variety of programs to be a university, still Valparaiso University emphasizes undergraduate teaching in the manner of the traditional small college, with many small classes and strong individual guidance. Valparaiso University is also a founding member of the New American Colleges and Universities, a national consortium of small to mid-sized colleges and universities that are committed to the ideal of integrating liberal and professional studies. Valparaiso University's unique status as an independent Lutheran university supplies the rationale for this special combination of liberal and professional studies. No church body has control or authority over the University, which is owned and operated by the Lutheran University Association. Valparaiso University is therefore both free and responsible to realize an educational ideal informed by the best traditions of Lutheran Christianity and of liberal and professional studies. Faith and Learning The University’s concern for the personal and intellectual development of each student is rooted in its Lutheran heritage. This Christian philosophy of education guides both the design of its curriculum and the approach to learning that it fosters. Beyond the courses in theology that the curriculum provides, the University emphasizes a Christian freedom that liberates the scholar to explore any idea and theory, a vocation freely uniting faith and intellectual honesty. In its residential life the University leads students to accept personal responsibility for their development and encourages a sense of caring for one another. Standing together at the center of the campus, the Chapel of the Resurrection and the Christopher Center for Library and Information Resources express the University’s belief in the creative relationship between faith and learning. The University’s motto, too, points up this relationship: In luce tua videmus lucem, "In Thy light we see light." The chapel is the focal point for worship, the proclamation of the Gospel, and many cultural events. Both Sunday and daily services bring together members of the University community who choose to worship together. Students and professional chapel staff offer a broad and creative ministry to the whole community. As the University welcomes students of varied denominations and religious traditions, so it welcomes the involvement of community churches in those students’ lives. A Roman Catholic student center, for example, is located next to the campus, and some churches of other denominations offer transportation to their services in the town. The Setting of the University The spacious campus of 320 acres contains more than sixty academic and residential buildings, many of them built within the past two decades. The campus is located in the small city of Valparaiso, attractively situated in a rural setting at the edge of the busy industrial district of Northwest Indiana. Fifteen miles to the north, on the shore of Lake Michigan, are the Indiana Dunes. The city of Chicago with its vast cultural resources, an hour’s drive from the campus, can be reached easily by train and bus. The University Valparaiso in Brief 9 often charters buses so that students and faculty can take advantage of the theatres, museums, and other educational benefits of this great city. Many programs of the University use the region--rich in natural, urban, and industrial opportunities for field trips and investigative activities. An Unusual History In its 150 year history, the University has passed through three distinct phases. Begun by Methodists in 1859 as an institution pioneering in coeducation, the Valparaiso Male and Female College was forced by the reverses of the Civil War to close its doors in 1871. It was revived in 1873 by an enterprising educator, Henry Baker Brown, as the Northern Indiana Normal School. "Mr. Brown’s School," a flourishing private, proprietary institution, was renamed Valparaiso College in 1900 and rechartered as Valparaiso University in 1907. During the next twenty years, it won national recognition as a low-cost, no-frills institution of higher learning which served thousands of students who might not otherwise have been able to afford a good education. Many alumni from this period achieved distinction in their fields as governors, legislators, scientists, business leaders, and other professionals. However, after World War I the University went into decline and bankruptcy; then, in 1925, The Lutheran University Association purchased it, beginning the modern phase of the University’s history. The association, an Indiana corporation composed of men and women, the majority of whom are affiliated with Lutheran congregations, is a national organization whose members represent the principal regions of the United States. Profile of Students and Faculty The heart of an academic institution is its students and faculty. Valparaiso University’s student body is selected from a large number of applicants from all states in the nation and from many foreign countries. Unlike most American colleges, which draw the majority of their students from their immediate location, Valparaiso University enrolls 42% of its undergraduate students from Indiana; another 48% of undergraduates come from Great Lakes states. Major contingents come, too, from both East and West coasts. National and diverse in its student body, the University is still a distinctively Midwestern institution which enjoys the friendliness and hard work characteristic of the region. Over 57% of the students come from the upper fifth of their high school graduating classes. Approximately twenty National Merit Scholars are enrolled at the University in any given year. A rich diversity characterizes the University faculty (312 full-time and 102 part-time professors), but they share important skills and attitudes as well. Educated at leading research universities, they are competent in their fields. They care about students, an attitude made visible by the frequent individual consultations they invite. Above all, they enjoy teaching and believe that their work enriches not only their students’ but their own lives. At Valparaiso University there are no teaching assistants; senior faculty members and newcomers alike can be found teaching introductory and advanced courses. The University embodies in its faculty an ideal of the teacher-scholar, one who recognizes that teaching is based on continuing scholarship. Many members of the faculty have achieved significant reputations in their particular fields and are pursuing, with marked success, grants from government and private foundations to promote research and improve instruction. In addition to The Cresset, a periodical review of literature, the arts and public affairs, published by the University, faculty edit from the campus two other national learned journals. University governance, too, reflects campus-wide involvement. Through the University Council, composed of faculty, students, administrators, and staff, students share in the development of University policy, including academic programs. Final responsibility for all academic programs, especially those which require certification, is vested in the faculty. The modest size of the University, its organization into five small undergraduate colleges, a school of law, and a school of graduate studies and continuing education, and especially the strong personal commitment of the faculty enhance its teaching effectiveness. In a school like this, with its concentrated residential focus and the immediate relationships it fosters between faculty and students, educational life is more vital and more intense than would be possible at massive institutions or at commuter colleges. Valparaiso University consciously fosters this tradition in the selection of both its students and its faculty and in the development of its educational programs.   10 Academic Programs The Goals of Education at Valparaiso University While appreciating the importance of preparing students for useful careers, Valparaiso University holds to the ideal that its students want an education which treats them first as human beings rather than simply as future wage earners. These students want to think clearly, to analyze facts and ideas, to draw sound conclusions from their reasoning and to express themselves clearly and creatively. They want to understand their cultural and religious heritage, developing a sensitivity to the culture and the viewpoints of others, while finding for themselves firm values and standards by which to live and make judgments. They want to become humane and responsible citizens in an ever changing society and to participate effectively in their institutions and communities. There is no simple formula for acquiring these abilities. Every degree program at Valparaiso University aims to assist students to attain these goals by offering a course of studies in general education which provides students with a broad base of knowledge and abilities, as well as in a particular area which leads to the mastery of concepts and tools of a single field of study. Both components, general education and the major field of studies, develop abilities in the student which go far beyond mere career preparation and provide intellectual enrichment for a lifetime. University-Wide Student Learning Objectives Through the following student learning objectives, Valparaiso University affirms its mission-based commitment to educate responsible global citizens who are ready to lead and serve church and society. These objectives are designed to help colleges and departments clearly link their student learning objectives to those of the University. All academic units will indicate how the learning outcomes of their curriculum and of individual courses within that curriculum link to some, or all, of the University-wide student learning objectives. The objectives are designed to include the cognitive, skill, and value domains of learning.  Students will: 1. Demonstrate theoretical and practical knowledge as well as the intellectual skills and creative capacities pertinent to their respective fields of study. 2. Solve both conceptual and applied problems by integrating broad-based knowledge, evidence-based reasoning, and informational literacy. 3. Practice experiential, interdisciplinary, and collaborative learning in both academic and co-curricular pursuits. 4. Communicate effectively in oral, written, and digital forms in increasingly complex contexts. 5. Engage in cross-cultural dialogue and experiences with the requisite knowledge to succeed in a diverse, global community. 6. Develop character, integrity, and wisdom as they discern their vocations and prepare to ethically lead and serve church and society.   Academic Programs 11 Degrees Undergraduate Degrees Associate of Arts Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering Associate of Science Bachelor of Science in Education Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science in Health Care Leadership Bachelor of Liberal and Professional Studies Bachelor of Science in Health Science Bachelor of Music Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering  Bachelor of Music Education Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science in Nursing Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Bachelor of Science in Physical Education Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering Bachelor of Science in Public Health Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelor of Social Work Graduate Degrees Doctor of Nursing Practice  Master of Health Administration Education Specialist  Master of Public Health Master of Arts  Master of Science  Master of Arts in Liberal Studies  Master of Science in Nursing  Master of Business Administration  Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies Master of Education  Law Degrees Juris Doctor   Master of Laws  Requirements and Flexibility Each degree entails a set of requirements which are specified at appropriate places in this bulletin.

The Freshman Year Even though they may express clear-cut decisions, college freshmen are often uncertain about their long-range career goals. The University fosters this openness by encouraging them to discover new interests while cultivating their current ones. All students, with the help of their academic advisors, design a program that allows them first to explore various areas of interest and, in due time, to develop a plan of study focusing on a major area of interest. The Valpo Core Course The Valparaiso Core Course is a two-semester, ten credit course required of all first-year students not enrolled in the Christ College Freshman Program. The primary subject of this interdisciplinary course is the human experience as great thinkers, writers, and artists have represented it. The primary object of the course is to welcome and initiate new students into this University community and academic life generally, by putting them in dialogue with great teachers and great texts, and of course, with each other, to explore together some of the most essential aspects of human existence, past, present, and future. The course is interdisciplinary because knowledge is interdisciplinary, and in the global community we now live in the world depends increasingly on people able to make connections across disciplines, across cultures, across oceans, across town. To prepare our students to succeed in this world and live meaningful lives of leadership and service, we recognize the need to introduce them to cultures and traditions other than their own. The reading list is multicultural and international because the world is multicultural and international. At the same time, we recognize the need to help students discover where they come from and where they are, which for the majority means exploring the Judeo-Christian intellectual tradition of the West, which produced, among other great things, this University. Hence, at the core of this Core Course, in the best spirit of Lutheran higher education, is the desire to create dialogues of texts and traditions, and to help our students grow in their understanding of how the past speaks to the present, how the sacred informs the secular. First-year students need special skills to enter fully into this dialogue and become successful students in the fullest sense. The Valpo Core is designed to help students develop those skills necessary for them to thrive in their studies, skills in close reading and critical thinking, in speaking, and especially in writing. Great opportunities also exist in the course for students to become more adept at retrieving, evaluating, and managing information, as they hook up to the rest of the world through our electronic information services. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Core Course, some institutions experience difficulties determining how to apply these credits toward their own general education requirements. "

Off-Campus Study Programs in the United States The Lutheran College Washington Consortium Valparaiso University is a member of the Lutheran College Washington Consortium, sponsored by a group of thirteen Lutheran colleges and universities. Valpo juniors and seniors can study in the fall, spring, or summer in Washington, DC at the Lutheran College Washington Semester. In the fall and spring, students participate in a 4 day per week internship and take two LCWS classes. LCWS will help students find an internship, and students earn 15 credit hours for the semester. The program can accommodate almost any major. LCWS students have interned in almost every field – from agriculture to zoology (and everything in between). Valpo LCWS students have interned at the White House, State Department, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, CNN, Sirius XM Radio, the US Marshals Service, the DNC & RNC, as well as think tanks, advocacy groups, and faith-based organizations. Academic Programs 14 Students register at Valparaiso University for the Washington Consortium Semester and pay to this University the tuition and fees. Expenses for travel and meals are paid directly by the students. The Washington Consortium Semester courses are accepted for full credit toward graduation from Valparaiso University. For information on the Washington Consortium Semester see valpo.edu/lcws. New American Colleges and Universities Consortium Valparaiso University is a member of the New American Colleges and Universities. The consortium is a national consortium of selective, small to mid-size (2,000 – 7,500 students) independent colleges and universities similar in mission to Valparaiso University. Students can apply to study at any of the member institutions for a semester in programs of the student's choosing. For detailed information, please refer to newamericancolleges.org Chicago Arts Program The Chicago Arts Program is a 15-week guide to the contemporary art world. In addition to attending a wide range of cultural events, students live in Chicago and meet and work with local artists and arts professionals on part-time internships and independent study projects, and in two courses, the core course, Negotiating the Art World, and an elective special topics seminar or studio course. Possible internship placements include in an artist’s studio; in a museum or gallery; with a theatre or dance company; with an orchestra or presenting venue; with a magazine or newspaper, and more. Not limited to arts majors, the program benefits all students who have strong interests in the arts. Chicago Business, Entrepreneurship, and Society Program The Business, Entrepreneurship, and Society Program in Chicago, offered in cooperation with the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, introduces the central themes of creativity, innovation, and problem solving as the fundamental tools of successful businesses and organizations of all types. The program challenges students to consider and apply these themes within the broader context of their experience living and working in Chicago as a major urban center. The program consists of 16 credit hours of coursework, which includes an internship with a local business or not-for-profit organization and a faculty-guided independent study project. Through their experiences living, working, and learning in Chicago, students will explore case studies of Chicago entrepreneurs, develop contacts with Chicago-based business leaders and entrepreneurs, learn to recognize entrepreneurial opportunities in everyday life, and deepen their knowledge of Chicago from a variety of perspectives. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible to participate. The program is offered both fall and spring semesters. Students register at Valparaiso University for the Chicago Business, Entrepreneurship, and Society Program and pay to this University the tuition and general fee. There is an additional fee for this program which is determined annually by the Associated Colleges of the Midwest. Expenses for travel and meals are paid directly by the students. Chicago Business, Entrepreneurship, and Society Program courses are accepted for full credit toward graduation from Valparaiso University. Chicago Urban Semester Through the College of Arts and Sciences and with the cooperation of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, the University offers to all students a one semester program involving residence in Chicago. This program offers students 16 credit hours of instruction including closely supervised internships and independent study projects. Through the course work, students learn the magnitude and complexity of an urban environment by analyzing and experiencing the political, social, economic, and cultural forces shaping a city. For descriptions of courses and grading policies refer to page 382. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors are eligible to participate. The program is offered both fall and spring semesters. Students register at Valparaiso University for the Chicago Urban Semester and pay to this University the tuition and general fee. There is an additional fee for this program which is determined annually by the Associated Colleges of the Midwest. Expenses for travel and meals are paid directly by the students. Chicago Urban Semester courses are accepted for full credit toward graduation from Valparaiso University. Cooperative Education Program Cooperative education is an academic program which combines professional work experience with academic coursework. Paid employment occurs in business, industry, government, or other professional settings. The Cooperative Education experience is available in the Colleges of Arts and Sciences (page 64), Business (page 291), Engineering (page 319), and Nursing and Health Professions (page 353). All students in good standing who meet the grade point minimum declared by the particular college may participate in the program. Students may enroll in full-time (called alternating) or part-time (called parallel) programs, except in the College of Engineering where only the alternating program is available. Academic credit for Cooperative Education is granted by the college or participating department in which the student is enrolled. The number of co-op credits counted toward a major or a degree varies Academic Programs 15 by college or department. Students should consult with faculty co-op coordinators to determine how co-op credits may apply to majors and/or degree requirements. The Cooperative Education Program enriches the total education of students by providing the opportunity to increase their sense of responsibility, judgment, and self-confidence through off-campus experiences that are closely integrated with their academic studies. Students are considered to be continuing full-time students of the University while on co-op assignment. Other Academic Opportunities Internships A number of internship opportunities have been established in several departments in the College of Arts and Sciences, in the College of Business, and in the College of Engineering. Some of these are optional, others are required. These internships allow students to learn by direct experience under the supervision of a professional. Further information is given in departmental descriptions. Service Learning Service learning is a credit based educational experience in which students participate in an organized service activity that meets identified community needs. Students reflect on the service activity in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of the discipline, and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility. Service learning provides an additional means for reaching educational objectives, and academic credit is appropriate for service activities when learning objectives associated with the service are identified and evaluated. Unlike extracurricular voluntary service, service learning is a course-based service experience that produces the best outcomes when meaningful service activities are related to course material through reflection activities such as writing and small group discussions. Unlike practica and internships, the experiential activity in a service learning course is not necessarily skill-based within the context of professional education. Guidelines for courses with a service learning component are as follows: 1. Courses should contain the equivalent of one to two hours per week of the service learning component. 2. A reasonable variety of service agency placements should be provided for each course. 3. Any given course may contain a service learning component; these courses will be designated as such in the current course schedule. 4. Students may be required to use their personal vehicles for travel to off-campus service sites. If off-campus work is required, students will sign a liability waiver. Honors Work and Independent Study The University encourages honors work and independent study. Each college has its own approach to this form of instruction. Information should be sought from deans or department chairs. Especially interesting is an opportunity for a group of students to develop a topic or area of studies to be approached as a group under the sponsorship of a faculty member. This independent group study program is administered through the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences but is open to all students. More detailed information is given on page 64. Christ College This college is itself one of the unique educational opportunities available to all students of the University. It is an honors college which offers an interdisciplinary honors curriculum which seeks to address questions which cannot be answered through a single discipline. The college has a core community of students who follow a special course of studies in the area of general education but welcomes all students to inquire into its programs and to participate in it. Details are given beginning on page 284. Summer Sessions The summer program serves a variety of undergraduate and graduate students. Regularly enrolled Valparaiso University students use the Summer Sessions to assist in completing additional majors or minors, distribute their academic load, accelerate their studies, or take maximum advantage of educational opportunities. Visiting students from other accredited institutions take courses for transfer to their home institution. Newly admitted students (freshmen, transfers, and graduates) may begin their work during the summer. Selected high school students may take courses to facilitate their educational objectives.   Academic Programs 16 The University offers one twelve-week and two six-week sessions. Although most courses are six weeks, within each six-week term usually a number of specialized courses are offered in shorter periods of time. The first of the two six-week terms begins immediately after May Commencement. Students may earn up to seven credits in each six-week session and a total of 14 for the summer, the equivalent of a semester’s work. Within each six-week term, a number of shorter courses with special pedagogical requirements are offered. Typically these last two or four weeks and usually involve field trips, field study (including international travel), and immersion experiences which use films, videos, or laboratories. Students normally may not take any other courses while taking a short course. Graduate School Early Entry Program Through the Graduate School Early Entry Program, undergraduates with junior standing and a GPA of at least 3.000 may apply for provisional admission to an eligible graduate degree program. If accepted, the student may take courses from the graduate catalog up to a maximum number of credits established by the graduate program, generally during the senior year, and apply them to his or her undergraduate degree. These credits may be used as undergraduate electives, or to complete a specific undergraduate program of study. In the latter case, the specific substitution of a graduate course for an undergraduate course is given in the description of the undergraduate program. During the senior year the student will work with both an undergraduate advisor and a graduate program advisor to coordinate the course articulations. Pending final acceptance to the graduate program in the student’s senior year, after the student matriculates to the Valparaiso University Graduate School, graduate credits earned while an undergraduate may be used in partial fulfillment of graduate degree program requirements. This reduces the cost and time required to earn the graduate degree. In some cases, two different degrees that would normally take 4+2 years to complete, if planned correctly, may be completed in 4+1 years. The graduate program specifies the limits on the number of graduate credits that may be applied to an undergraduate degree, but generally no more than half of the credits for a graduate program may be applied to both programs. All undergraduate students interested in the Early Entry program should apply during their junior year. See the GRADUATE CATALOG for details. Early Entry is different from two other accelerated programs where graduate coursework does not count for undergraduate study. In the first case, there are accelerated paired programs (3+2), in which the student completes the bachelor’s degree in three years and then enters the two year master’s degree after passing a series of checkpoints specified by the graduate program. In the second case, under the Graduate School Early Admission program, a senior with nine or fewer hours remaining in the final semester may be provisionally admitted to a graduate program and may take up to twelve total semester hours of undergraduate and graduate courses combined. See the GRADUATE CATALOG for details. Special Course, Program, and Activities Requirements Some University courses, programs, or activities require students to travel to locations off campus. When the University does not provide the transportation, or when it does and the student elects not to use it, the student is solely responsible for making his or her own safe and responsible travel plans. Some University courses, programs, or activities also involve internship, practica, student teaching, and the like with third parties outside of the University. Some of these third parties, such as school districts or private sector employers, may require criminal, or similar background checks of the students. Each student must comply with these requests if he or she is to participate in the course, program, or activity. Lectures Valparaiso University presents numerous lectures by scholars and public figures on topics of scholarly or current interest as an integral part of its academic program. Various endowed and named lectures are also presented each year, bringing distinguished men and women to the campus to address the University community. The Walter E.

Students can explore their academic and professional interests in another part of the world while developing transferrable skills for their future such as cultural awareness, adaptability, independence, and in many cases proficiency in a foreign language. Credits and grades earned through Valpo-affiliated programs count towards graduation requirements and a variety of opportunities enable students to spend a semester, academic year, or even shorter terms such as spring break and summer in another country. Students can choose from several program types including 1.) the Valpo Study Centers, 2.) Direct enrollment at an exchange partner university, 3.) Cooperative programs administered by a U.S.-based provider, 4.) the Valparaiso International Engineering Programs (VIEP), 5.) Faculty-led, short-term programs or research during breaks, and 6.) Consortia membership opportunities. Credits and grades earned through Valpo-approved programs are treated as though they were earned on campus. While the course offerings available through these programs vary considerably, students may frequently satisfy some Major, Minor, and/ or General Education Requirements through courses taken in these programs. Students should consult with department chairs and their academic advisor prior to participation in any program to verify that courses will satisfy certain requirements. General Education Requirements which have in the past been fulfilled or partially fulfilled by courses taken through these programs include the following: Fine Arts/Fine Arts-Literature, Foreign Language, History/Philosophy, Social Science, and Theology. Participation in any Valparaiso University semester or year-long study-abroad program fulfills the Cultural Diversity Requirement or Christ College seminar credit. Students considering study abroad should consult their academic advisor as well as the Office of International Programs early in their academic program, to ensure the coherence and continuity of that program. Freshman year is not too early to begin thinking about studying abroad and with careful planning students can complete their degree program on time. International Study Programs 21 Applications open early in the semester before the term abroad. The deadlines remain the same each year. They are:  Summer, Fall, and Academic Year: March 1  Spring and Spring Break: October 1 Some programs do have early deadlines depending on required host applications or other requirements. It is important to double check the individual page for the program(s) of interest to determine the official deadline. While students will not apply for their study abroad program until the semester before, they are encouraged to meet with a study abroad advisor, their academic advisor, and their financial aid advisor to begin planning as early as possible. Study abroad programs have varying requirements for admission. All programs have a minimum cumulative GPA requirement, although some programs have flexibility for students that are close to the minimum and will be considered for admission on a case-by-case basis. Some programs have a minimum foreign language requirement, a minimum class standing, or other requirements for admission. Consult the program page and/or the program’s study abroad advisor for information on admission requirements. Most financial aid that students receive while attending Valparaiso University may be applied to the Valparaiso University-approved programs. Exceptions may include work-study and other on-campus aid such as music, performance, or athletic scholarships, which are simply put on hold for the semester off-campus. Please meet with your Financial Aid Advisor for details on your specific award and how it will apply to study abroad. For approved programs, students will pay regular tuition and general fee on campus. This will be posted to the Student Account just as it would for a student staying on campus. Depending on the program, room and board, a Center Fee, or other costs may be assessed through their Student Account as well. Each program page has a Budget Sheet for the current terms that will give an estimate of overall cost, including expenses paid directly to the program provider and general out-of-pocket expenses. The study abroad advisors can go over cost information in detail with interested students. Students who choose to participate in programs not on the approved list, at their own expense, should consult with the director of Study Abroad Programs. When students decide on a program, it is necessary to obtain the prior approval of an academic advisor, the director of Study Abroad Programs, and the dean of the college in order to assure in advance that the credit for courses taken abroad will transfer to Valparaiso University. If participating in a semester or year program, the student will need to submit a Leave of Absence. Also, the student should meet with a member of the Financial Aid Office. Although Valparaiso University grants/scholarships are not available for non-Valparaiso University programs, Federal, Indiana, and private scholarships and loans are. You should continue to file your FAFSA by the state deadline each year. The Financial Aid Office will discuss your plans with you and answer questions regarding aid for your time off-campus as well as implications for outstanding student loans. Valpo Study Centers Cambridge, England Directed by a resident professor from Valparaiso University, the Cambridge Study Center provides an ideal setting for up to eighteen students each semester to integrate their academic work with the rich heritage of Britain. Students live in facilities provided by the University, choose from a wide variety of courses as determined by their individual needs, and participate in two or three group excursions to various historical regions of Britain. British professors may accompany students on these tours, helping them to integrate their cultural experience with their academic learning. Program Requirements Sophomore standing and a grade point average of 2.750 are required. Program Curriculum This program offers an exciting array of courses through a combination of offerings taught by the Resident Director, or offered through our partners at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) and the Westfield House.

Advanced Placement Program Students who submit results of Advanced Placement examinations are eligible to receive credit in accordance with the following table. AP examinations must be taken before enrollment as a full-time student at Valparaiso University. For more information, contact the Admissions Office. Examination   Required Score Art Studio: 2D Design  credit may only be granted by transfer credit for courses taken prior to the student enrolling at Valparaiso University, and will only apply toward transfer students; freshmen will not be awarded  credit. Any credit transferred to Valparaiso University after the student has begun their career at Valparaiso University will not be considered as applicable toward fulfilling . Major Requirements Statements of equivalence for academic majors, interdisciplinary programs, or professional block schedules are prepared by the colleges or departments concerned. Preliminary Mathematics Placement Information Upon entry to Valparaiso University, all students who do yet not have college credit for mathematics are given a preliminary placement into appropriate mathematics classes through an evaluation process that includes any or all of ACT or SAT math scores, high school GPA, and math classes taken along with grades earned during senior year. If a student determines the preliminary placement level is suitable, there is no need to continue and take the math placement assessment. If a student wishes to improve the preliminary placement, then he or she should take the math placement assessment. The descriptions of the specific placement levels and the means for the preliminary determination follow. Placement Level 3 Students at this level are eligible for everything listed for Placement Group 2, as well as  credit may only be granted by transfer credit for courses taken prior to the student enrolling at Valparaiso University. Any credit transferred to Valparaiso University after the student has begun their career at Valparaiso University will not be considered as applicable toward fulfilling  requirements. Credit for workshops, institutes, or travel study ordinarily is granted only for work taken at Valparaiso University. In cases of exception to the preceding restriction, transfer credit for institutes or workshops will not exceed one credit per calendar week of instruction. Transfer credit for travel study programs will usually not exceed two credits per calendar week. Resident students who wish to take courses at other approved schools concurrently with their Valparaiso work should refer to the appropriate paragraph under Residence Requirements on page 415. Change to Another Program If a student transfers from one major or interdisciplinary program to another, all requirements of the new specialization must be met. Such a transfer subjects credits previously earned to a reevaluation. In certain cases the change of program may result in some loss of credit (e.g., if a course taken as a General Education Requirement is superseded by another course required for the new major). Therefore, such transfers may not be made without the written approval of the advisors and deans concerned. Necessary forms are available through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. In the case of transfer from one college to another, students should be sure to review the requirements for the degrees of the new college and note any restrictions on credit hours which may be transferred from the former college.   Academic Policies 414 Examinations Written tests and quizzes are given from time to time during the semester at the discretion of the instructor. A final examination is required in all courses of 3 credit hours or more. Exceptions may be made for such courses as independent study, practica and internships, performance, studio, and activity courses. Final examinations are held at the close of each semester and, for courses of 3 credit hours or more, must be conducted according to a schedule published by the Office of the Registrar. Final examinations in courses of less than three credits are conducted during regularly scheduled class periods. In order to give students adequate opportunity to prepare for final examinations, no tests may be given in courses of 3 credit hours or more within seven days before the beginning of the examination period. Exceptions to these policies require the written approval of the dean of the college in which the course is offered. Absence from Class All students are expected to attend every one of their classes unless their absence has been approved by the instructor concerned or the appropriate dean. Absence from class is primarily a matter between the student and the instructor of the class. It is the students’ responsibility to discuss with their instructors the reason for their absence and to learn what makeup work may be required. Withdrawal from the University A student who wishes to withdraw from the University for the remainder of a semester or session must apply to the dean of students for a permit to withdraw by the deadline (see page 5). Upon return of the properly signed permit to the Office of the Registrar, the return of such fees as are refundable will be in accordance to the published refund schedule (see page 424). If students withdraw after the seventh week of the semester, they are ordinarily not granted readmission for the following semester, unless extreme contributory circumstances such as severe illness caused the withdrawal. The term “honorable dismissal” refers to conduct and character only, not to class standing and grades. It is not granted unless the students’ conduct and character are such as would entitle them to continue in the University. A student who stops attending the University without completing the appropriate paperwork is not entitled to refunds of any kind, and the instructor of each course in which the student is enrolled is required to report a final grade of F to the Office of the Registrar. For the Law School, consult that School’s bulletin. Graduation Responsibility of the Student Every candidate for a degree is personally responsible for meeting all requirements for graduation. No University official or advisor can relieve the student of this responsibility. Students in an undergraduate program of the University may fulfill the requirements for graduation under any catalog issued during their years of attendance, beginning with the year they first entered the University, provided there is no absence of five or more years between periods of attendance. (For the Law School, consult that School’s bulletin.) All requirements in one catalog issue must be met. Students must resolve all Incomplete and NR grades prior to graduation. NR (No Report) grades are used as a temporary grade on transcripts if the final grade has not been reported to the Office of the Registrar. Valparaiso University has three graduation periods per academic year: May, August, and December. These graduation periods begin on the last day of each academic term and continue for 30 days. Any student with unmet requirements at the close of the graduation period must defer to the next graduation period, regardless of the circumstances. In order to graduate, students must complete the Graduation Application, available through DataVU, for each degree or certificate separately by the deadlines published in the University Calendar. Students who return to the University after an absence of five or more years may no longer be a candidate for a degree on the basis of the catalog requirements covered by their previous years of attendance, but must fulfill for graduation all the requirements and provisions beginning with the catalog of the year in which they reenter the University. In addition, credits earned at Valparaiso University more than fifteen years before reentry are subject to reevaluation and shall not be accepted toward graduation requirements unless approved by the appropriate Faculty Senate standing committee. After a student has been awarded a degree from Valparaiso University, that degree cannot be altered. Students may not take courses after graduation for the purpose of adding a major, adding a minor, or changing a GPA. Students cannot add a major or minor after graduation, even if their previous coursework corresponds to an additional credential/major/minor/certificate within their catalog. Degrees, diplomas, and transcripts are withheld for a students whose account with the University has not been settled in full.  Academic Policies 415 Second Degrees In order to receive a second degree, a student must earn at least thirty semester credits and sixty quality points in excess of the total number of semester credits required for the first degree and, in addition, the student must fulfill all the specific course requirements for the second degree. No course used to fulfill a major or minor requirement for one degree may be used to fulfill any major or minor requirement for a second degree. This restriction refers to courses within the major or minor field, not to additional courses required from outside of the major or minor field. A student who selects an individualized major or minor for any degree may not use the designated courses to fulfill any other graduation requirement. Each degree must contain all of the components necessary for each to be a complete program, including those described in the major field requirements (see page 48). Approval of applications for dual degrees must be given by the appropriate advisors and deans. No student may graduate at one commencement with more than one degree of the same notation. Students in the Graduate School should refer to that division’s bulletin for specific information. Credit and Quality Point Requirements Candidates for graduation with an associate’s degree or a bachelor’s degree must have a grade point average of 2.000 or more in all their work at Valparaiso University. In addition, candidates for a bachelor’s degree must have a grade point average of 2.000 or more in all majors, minors, or interdisciplinary programs, based on their work at Valparaiso University. Candidates for the Associate in Science degree must have a grade point average of 2.000 in all of their science courses at Valparaiso University. Candidates for the Associate of Arts degree must have a grade point average of 2.000 in their concentration area. In the computation of the students’ standings, grades of D+, D, D-, and F are included. Grades of S, U, and W are not included. Candidates for a master’s degree or the Juris Doctor degree should consult the appropriate bulletin for the corresponding requirement. Residence Requirements Regardless of other degree requirements, candidates for all bachelor’s degrees must meet the following requirements in residence at Valparaiso University: 1. At least one-half the number of credit hours required for all majors, minors, or interdisciplinary programs (a minimum of 15 credit hours in the area of foreign languages) 2. At least three credits in theology 3. At least thirty of the last forty credits presented for the degree Residence requirements for master’s degrees and the Juris Doctor degree may be found in the appropriate bulletins. Ordinarily, credit is not given for courses taken concurrently at other approved schools or for correspondence courses taken during a student’s enrollment at this University. Any exception to this policy must have the approval of the student’s academic advisor, the dean of the appropriate college, and the Committee on Academic and Professional Standards. Note that credit for courses taken under one of the international study semesters or special semester programs described beginning on pages 5 and 20 apply as taken in residence at this University. Residence requirements for the undergraduate baccalaureate degrees awarded by the College of Business can be found on page 291. Application for a Degree Students initiate the graduation process by discussing their plan of study with their advisor and completing a Graduation Application online through DataVU. A student who wishes to receive a degree at the end of a Fall Semester must formally apply no later than the preceding April 1st.

Its residential and co-curricular life encourages students to develop their full potentials, complementing and enriching their academic curricula. The Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs coordinates the services offered to students and promotes a wide range of campus activities which enhance residential living at Valparaiso University. Student Residences The majority of undergraduate students live in one of twelve University residence halls and apartment buildings, or in one of the five fraternity houses located on or near the campus. Alumni, Brandt, Lankenau, and Wehrenberg Halls are residence halls with rooms for two students. All are coed halls with men and women living on alternate floors.

In addition, Uptown East Apartments, and Promenade East Apartments provide apartment-style living options for upper class students. The Kade-Duesenberg German House and Cultural Center offers students the opportunity to live in a German language house. Student Conduct and the Honor System Valparaiso University holds to the ideal of a community of Christian scholars living together in freedom and civility, in an environment conducive to Christian faith and supportive of the Christian ethic. A minimum number of rules and regulations is necessary for this community; these are found principally in the STUDENT GUIDE TO UNIVERSITY LIFE. Each student enrolling at Valparaiso University thereby accepts the rules, regulations, and procedures as found in this catalog and the STUDENT GUIDE TO UNIVERSITY LIFE. Conformity to the traditions and regulations of the University is expected. The University reserves the right to suspend or dismiss any student at any time when, in the judgment of its authorities, that action is deemed to be in the best interests of the institution. Such a decision is normally made by the Vice President for Student Affairs on the recommendation of the Campus Judicial Board. The student-initiated Honor System has a long history at Valparaiso University and is a strong distinguishing characteristic of the institution. It is in every way consistent with the highest principles of Christian ethics and morality. In sanctioning the Honor System, the University presumes that students are able and willing to accept the duties and responsibilities of honorable conduct for the sake of the Valparaiso University community. All entering students must agree that they understand the Honor System and are aware that all of their academic work must be submitted under their signature and that they have done this work in agreement with the Honor Code. The statement "I have neither given or received nor have I tolerated others’ use of unauthorized aid" must be written out and signed on all written work. Under the Honor System, all written examinations of any length are taken in an atmosphere free from the surveillance of a proctor, unless specifically requested. Every student has the responsibility to keep academic work free of dishonesty; that is, neither to give nor to receive unauthorized aid. All students must report to the Honor Council any violation of the system of which they become aware. Students are required to sign a pledge on all work submitted for academic credit as indicated above. The Honor Council is an educational, preventive, remedial, and judicial body with the duty of maintaining the Honor System in the academic community. The council hears Honor Code cases and then makes decisions about whether or not a student has violated the code and assesses any penalties. The council is composed of students and faculty. The students are chosen by the incumbent members subject to the approval of the president of the University, and the faculty members are elected by the faculty. The Arts The mission of the programs in the visual and performing arts at Valparaiso University is to educate students by opening their eyes and ears to the best of their artistic heritage and the joy of artistic expression. The University offers its students a range of arts opportunities through its general education curriculum; co-curricular activities in art, music, theatre, dance, and creative writing; and academic majors in the departments of visual and performing arts which permit students to make the arts the focus of a liberal education for personal and professional development and for creative leadership and service. At Valparaiso University, the arts serve primarily the students, while also serving the faculty and staff and the larger community of the region.   Student Life 38 Music The Department of Music offers all students the opportunity to study and perform as singers and instrumentalists in an array of curricular and co-curricular ensembles. Students wishing to perform in selective ensembles may audition for the Valparaiso University Chorale, the University Symphony Orchestra, the Kantorei, Jazz Ensemble, and the Chamber Concert Band, as well as a variety of chamber ensembles including Woodwind Quintet, String Quartet, Percussion Ensemble, Brass Ensemble, and others.

Additional student-organized performing groups include Crusader Band, Handbell Choir, Matins Choir, and various a cappella singing groups. For an additional charge, a limited number of students may enroll in private music lessons in voice, piano, guitar, organ, and most orchestral and band instruments. Theatre The University Theatre brings the best of classic drama, new plays, musicals, and operas to the Valparaiso University Center for the Arts.

Several internships are available to students on and off-campus. Summer programs of study in Europe or Asia are also available to provide students with immediate experience of diverse cultural heritages, in addition to all regular foreign studies programming during the academic year. Dance Through learning and participating in dance, students are able to reflect on the ways dance is part of the human experience and part of their own lives. Each semester students may choose from a number of different dance courses offered through the Department of Theatre. Styles covered may include: ballet, tap, jazz, modern, and musical theatre styles. University Dance Ensemble Under the leadership of Department of Theatre faculty, the University Dance Ensemble meets regularly throughout the academic year for technique classes and choreography.

Campus Ministry Standing together at the center of campus, the Chapel of the Resurrection and the Christopher Center for Library and Information Resources express the University's belief in the creative relationship between faith and learning. The connection between Lutheran heritage and academic studies extends far beyond the classroom at Valparaiso University. Our students, faculty, staff, and alumni reach out from this center of liberal and professional learning with a sense of Christian vocation to serve not only the campus and Valparaiso community, but also in places around the world. This includes, but is not limited to, those who serve the church as ministers, educators, artists, musicians, and scholars. Nurses, engineers, and business professionals are also a major part of the connection between life and faith. Centered in Christ, the ministry of the Chapel of the Resurrection proclaims God’s love, serves students, faculty, staff, and the wider community, and welcomes all. Worship at the Chapel of the Resurrection draws upon the gifts of Christians from across the centuries and around the world. Students, pastors, and other members of the University community shape each worship service through music and art, proclamation, and prayer. The Chapel offers a service of Holy Communion every Sunday morning, year-round. When classes are in session, students can also worship at a Sunday evening service called Candlelight and at Celebrate, a mid-week contemporary service. The single most frequent worship opportunity is Morning Prayer, a 20-minute service that begins at 10:00 a.m. each class day. Worship styles change from day to day, season to season, with music ranging from ancient to contemporary. Morning Prayer is a time for students, faculty, and staff to gather as a community of faith, hear God's word, pray, and give praise. Other special services are also offered throughout the year, including Advent-Christmas Vespers, Ash Wednesday, Holy Week services, and more. All are welcome. Students provide leadership in planning the majority of the Morning Prayer, Candlelight, and Celebrate services at the chapel. There are numerous opportunities for students to lead worship services, serve in choirs (including the Kantorei and handbell choirs), or support worship life in a variety of roles. Service opportunities are also available through the chapel's Social Action Leadership Team (SALT) and the Peer Ministry. Peer Ministers serve as mentors, a caring presence, and role models to first year students, being available to peers, fostering relationships, creating program and spiritual growth opportunities, and connecting students in need of spiritual care with the pastoral staff of the Chapel. Peer Ministers live in the freshman residence halls and are an integral part of both the Residential Life team and the chapel ministry. All students are invited throughout the year to attend one of the spiritual retreats, which lead participants in the disciplines of prayer and spiritual discernment, especially in the area of life vocation. The University pastors are also available to all students for counseling. The chapel works with a variety of ecumenical and parachurch partners on campus through the Campus Ministry Network. Student Life 42 The Institute for Leadership and Service The Institute for Leadership and Service is a program dedicated to preparing students for lives of leadership and service -- lives shaped by a sense of calling, equipped for thoughtful reflection, and responsive to the world's deepest challenges.

For more information on Leadership Programs please email leadership@valpo.edu. The Office of Multicultural Programs The Office of Multicultural Programs (OMP) acts as a hub for diversity and inclusion on campus, with a focus on supporting underrepresented student populations. The OMP supports the student body and University community by concentrating on four key areas: leadership in diverse communities, education, celebration, and retention of underrepresented populations. Having many diverse cultures represented on campus gives the OMP the chance to celebrate with our students. Students are given the opportunity to increase their appreciation of people and experiences that are vastly different from their own. VU students have the chance to celebrate the world we live in through their connections to fellow students and multicultural and multi-ethnic events and celebrations. Students have the opportunity to lead through participation in affinity-based student organizations. The OMP advises four student organizations: Asian American Pacific Islander Coalition (AAPIC), Alliance (LGBTQ+), Black Student Organization (BSO), and Latinos in Valparaiso for Excellence (LIVE). All students are invited to be involved with these groups. Students that are involved will practice and refine the social, financial, and practical skills needed to lead in any diverse community. To help retain underrepresented populations at VU, the OMP has developed, and features, one mentoring program and two gender-based affinity groups that work to ensure the persistence of all our students. “Smart Connections” is a strong peer-mentoring program that focuses on first-year students and connects them to an upperclassman in a big brother/sister style relationship. Students are matched 1-on-1 with a “pace setting peer” who is trained to help students get connected and navigate the first year. Women of Worth (WOW) and the Male Empowerment Network (MEN) give students the opportunity to connect with Valpo alumni and others as they pave their pathway to a successful future.

For more information, please visit the Student Health Center website at valpo.edu/student-health-center. Academic Advising Valparaiso University strives to empower students to reflect on their vocations, take ownership of their education and professional development, and to lead and serve in the ever-changing global community. Academic advising provides information about higher education processes, procedures, and program expectations. Entering students are assigned to an academic advisor to assist them in selecting a curriculum, meeting University requirements, and making the most of their studies. Students who have not declared a major are assigned an exploratory advisor; however, as soon as students declare a major, they are assigned to a departmental advisor.  All students must meet with their academic advisors before students may register for classes each semester. The advising meeting indicates only that advisors have counseled the student on the best course selection to progress to degree attainment. Students should use the program evaluation (degree audit) option on DataVU to track their graduation requirements. Access and Accommodations Resource Center (AARC) Valparaiso University, through its mission statement, strives to maintain a supportive environment which will promote the learning and well-being of all students. The following information is provided to assist those students with disabilities who are seeking academic accommodations and support. The student must have met all qualifications for admission and be officially admitted to the University prior to seeking support services provided by AARC. Inquiries should be directed to AARC at 219.464.6496 or by email at aarc@valpo.edu. The University is committed to meeting its obligation to provide effective auxiliary aid and assistance to students with disabilities. The provision of auxiliary assistance is primarily the responsibility of the Department of Rehabilitation Services of the state in which the student maintains legal residence. If the request for assistance is denied by the local agency, Valparaiso Student Life 45 University's provision of accommodations will be based upon a case by case analysis of an individual student's need and his/her eligibility under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and its regulations. In order to be considered for accommodations, the student: 1. May, but is not required to, apply to his/ her local Department of Rehabilitation Services Office before attending Valparaiso University, or as soon as is reasonably possible upon diagnosis of a disability, in order to allow time for funding to be allocated. Upon request, the University will assist in the application. 2. Should be admitted to one of the colleges of the University. 3. Must submit a written diagnosis of the disability and its impact on learning from appropriate professional personnel. 4. Should notify the director of Disability Support Services in writing before the first day of classes, or as soon as is reasonably possible upon diagnosis of a disability. Such notice is required to determine eligibility and to give the various academic and service areas a reasonable period of time to plan to meet the individual's special needs. For further information, please refer to Valparaiso University's Access and Accommodations Resource Center website: valpo.edu/access-and-accommodations-resource-center. Graduate Tutoring Graduate content tutoring is coordinated with the Graduate School in communication with the graduate program directors. Graduate tutoring is made available across program content areas to serve the academic needs of all graduate students. Tutoring is provided in a location that is determined by the program director and the instructor of the course in which tutoring is being provided. The “Fourth-Hour” tutoring option may be available to international students taking introductory courses to help cultivate and develop professional vocabulary and spoken English language proficiency within a specific discipline. If a graduate student expresses interest in additional one-on-one tutoring for a particular class, an attempt will be made by the Graduate School to find someone to help. Graduate faculty and students are available to assist graduate students, and online writing assistance may be available. Academic Support Services Academic Learning Centers There are four academic learning centers on campus: Academic Success Center (ASC), Hesse Learning Resource Center, Language Resource Center, and Judith L. Beumer Writing Center. These learning centers are united in purpose and distinct in service. Valpo students have access to numerous campus resources committed to success inside and outside the classroom. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the learning centers, where peer tutors are available to help them grow as writers, strengthen learning strategies, practice language skills, and thrive during their academic journey. Tutoring The learning centers provide free tutoring services in a variety of forms and venues across campus. Students experiencing difficulties with coursework, or students wanting to further improve their skills, should consider the following options: 1. Work with the Professor – The first option for help in a course is usually for the student to work directly with the professor during weekly office hours. Frequently, simple concerns regarding coursework can be resolved by speaking to the professor. 2. Help Sessions – Besides seeking support from the professor, the student should also seek help provided by departments, colleges, and learning centers. Some departments have undergraduate teaching assistants and student aides who provide group help sessions for first and second year courses free of charge to students. Professional colleges also arrange academic support in conjunction with particular courses, and the university’s learning centers function to offer group and individual learning assistance. 3. Tutoring – If help sessions are not available or have not met the need, then a student can seek tutoring opportunities from one of the campus learning centers. Each center connects students with tutors through a specific process. Some centers have an application process where students can request to be paired with a tutor for certain courses; pairing is based on individual needs and tutor availability. Other centers serve students through drop-in tutoring hours or online scheduling for individual or shared appointments. Students should contact the appropriate center to learn how to connect with a tutor for a specific course or subject. If students are uncertain where to begin, they should visit the welcome desk in the Academic Success Center (ground floor of the library) for a referral. 4. Study Groups – Students are also encouraged to gather in small groups and work with each other in mastering class material. This practice reinforces learning from daily lectures and supports good study habits. Student Life 46 Academic Success Center (ASC) The ASC is located in the Christopher Center Library, Room 110, on the lower level by the Writing Center. For more information visit the ASC in person or online at valpo.edu/academic-success-center, call 219.464.5985, or email Academic.Success@valpo.edu.

For a list of the academic fields of study, see page 12. Individualized Major An approved individualized major of thirty credit hours may be presented instead of the departmental majors listed above. This major is intended for students with clearly defined academic or career objectives who feel that their specific needs are not met by the departmental major option nor by the interdisciplinary program option described below. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences may propose a plan for an individualized major, using the form available in the Office of the Registrar’s website. The major must satisfy the following conditions. 1. The proposed major must include at least 30 credit hours but not more than 48 credit hours chosen from two or more departments. 2. The proposed major must be accompanied by a minor within a discipline listed in the GENERAL CATALOG. 3. None of the courses chosen may be courses used to meet the General Education requirements. 4. Courses taken for this major may not be counted for credit towards a minor or second major. 5. The proposed major must be supported and supervised by a faculty advisor. 6. A comprehensive rationale statement by the student justifying the major must accompany the Individualized Major form. This form must list the specific courses to be taken and be signed by the student and the faculty supervisor before it is presented to the Dean’s Office for approval. Any revisions must also be approved by the dean of the college. 7. The proposed major must be submitted to the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for approval, preferably by the beginning of the junior year, but no later than November 1 for December degree candidates and April 1 for May or August degree candidates.

No course may be used to fulfill two majors or both a major and a minor requirement except with the permission of the dean of the college. This restriction refers to courses within the major or minor field, not to additional courses required from outside of the major or minor field. 2. An approved individualized minor. 15 credit hours may be presented in lieu of the departmental minor. At least 9 credit hours must be taken beyond the introductory level. None of the courses chosen may be courses used to meet the General Education Requirements. Forms for individualized minors are available in the Dean’s Office. A student may not graduate with both an individualized major and an individualized minor as the method of fulfilling major area graduation requirements. 3. A second academic major. A second major may be chosen from Departmental Major options or an interdisciplinary program. An approved individualized major may also be presented in fulfillment of requirements of a second major, unless the first major is also an individualized major. Only one individualized major or minor may be applied to the major field requirement. 4. A complementary major. A major which enhances and expands a first major. This major may not be a first major. 5. A first major with at least forty credit hours.

The appropriate degrees are described earlier, beginning on page 48. In addition, students can prepare for teaching in secondary schools under a variety of majors for Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. The Diaconal Education and Formation Process, the pre-legal program, and the pre-medical arts programs are professional preparatory programs a student may complete while pursuing a liberal arts major. Students interested in any of these programs should declare the program before entering the sophomore year. Those pursuing an Associate in Science degree may elect the cytotechnology certification option. This program requires the student to complete a one year program in an accredited school of cytotechnology and a one year prescribed course of study at Valparaiso University. The credits from the cytotechnology program (usually 30) will transfer to Valparaiso University to meet about half of the requirements for the A.S. degree. See page 50 for the degree requirements for the Associate in Science degree. Students should contact a pre-medical arts advisor for specific science courses that must be completed. Teacher Education Programs The Teacher Education Program is under the direction of the Department of Education. Eligibility for admission to the program is determined by the department. The University currently prepares applicants for licensure in the following licensure categories listed under types of school and developmental settings. License: Elementary Teaching Elementary: Grades K-6 Additional content areas in any subject areas listed under Secondary Teaching License: Secondary Teaching Grades 5-12 Content Areas: English/Language Arts World Languages-Chinese, French, German, Latin, Spanish Mathematics Science-Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Chemistry, Physics, Earth/Space Sciences Social Studies History P-12 License Art Education Exceptional Needs- Mild Intervention Health Education Music Education Physical Education World Languages-Chinese, French, German, Latin, Spanish Preparation for the Medical Arts Students can prepare for entrance into medical, dental, veterinary, medical technology, physical therapy, or paramedical schools by entering one of the pre-medical arts programs of the college. Students in these programs must have their schedules approved at the beginning of each semester by a major advisor and an assigned pre-medical arts academic advisor. Advising in the pre-medical arts is handled by pre-medical advisors, who are members of the Committee on Pre-Medical Arts. All recommendations to the professional schools are sent out by this Committee: Professor Nelson (Psychology); Associate Professors Goyne (Chemistry), K. Jantzi (Chemistry), Scaglione-Sewell (Biology), Schoer (chair, Chemistry), Scupham (Biology); Assistant Professor R. Clark (Chemistry). Pre-medical and pre-dental students are invited to join the Premedical Society, a student organization that promotes interest in medicine and dentistry through a program of guest lectures and social events. Those with outstanding academic records may be invited to join Alpha Epsilon Delta, a national medical honorary society. In some fields such as medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine, completion of a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree is often required before admission to a professional school. However, if three years or less of college work are needed for entrance into a professional program, a student may earn a bachelor’s degree through the University’s Combined Liberal Arts-Medical Arts program. This involves three years of work at Valparaiso University and one year of work at an approved professional school. Details are in the next section of this catalog. This program is often used by students in medical technology. College of Arts and Sciences 61 Students who want to enter allied health fields that require two years or less of college preparation may want to earn the Associate in Science Degree described on page 50.

These stand-alone programs typically range from 15 to 30 credits. Each is designed to serve the needs of a specific professional audience and as such each has its own admission requirements. Certificate students may not be seeking a degree at Valparaiso University and are limited to eleven credits per semester (seven during each summer session). Fundamentals of Business This 18 credit certificate introduces students with little or no academic background in business to the fundamentals of business. The certificate emphasizes breadth of coverage regarding the areas of business and is open to those having at least an associate’s degree. Coursework may be applied toward a business degree at Valparaiso University. This program is not open to degree-seeking students at Valparaiso University. Geographic and Environmental Policy Systems This interdisciplinary basic or advanced certificate (15 or 30 credits) prepares professionals for planning of space and environments in a variety of natural and human-made settings. The program emphasizes training in GIS software, its application to specific situations and its larger context of use (including policy). The certificate is appropriate for persons holding undergraduate and/or graduate degrees. Information, Communication, and Technology Software Design is a 20-21 credit certificate for developing proficiency in computer programming and design of software. This certificate is particularly appropriate for natural science, business, and engineering professionals needing to broaden their understanding of software design. A certified student possesses fundamental skills for general programming and in-depth knowledge of the current programming language JAVA. Graduates are able to adapt to new programming environments with a minimum of training and if desired, are prepared for entry into graduate study in computer science. Information Technology is a 20-credit certificate on how to “use” rather than how to “design” computer systems. It combines software coursework in programming with several applications courses that deal with software systems and how they work. The program is open to any individual having an undergraduate degree (with some basic math), but is most useful to science and business majors. A certified student could work with digital communication systems as a programmer or analyst, understand communication protocols, and manage computer networks or internet resources. Digital Systems Design is for individuals who need to refresh or upgrade an existing engineering or science education by learning more about computer systems. This 15-credit program provides modest depth of exposure to a variety of computer engineering topics. Certified students would understand computer software and hardware well enough to apply them to their primary discipline. They would be able to design small digital circuits, write programs for controllers, design computer elements, and analyze computer networks. Communication and Information Management is an 18-credit program designed for individuals wanting to develop proficiency in a variety of electronic applications related to communication and information. Certified students would possess an array of current technological skills relevant to publication, publicity, interoffice and electronic communication, and data management. They could understand and develop websites; work with desktop publishing; create, maintain, and manipulate data files; plan and design graphic presentations; and oversee office information systems. Organizational Management This 24-credit certificate is intended for individuals who work in an administrative or supervisory capacity and who would therefore benefit from training in business-related areas, including accounting, personnel management, marketing, business law, leadership, and business ethics. The certificate is open to persons with or without an undergraduate degree. All coursework may be applied toward a business degree at Valparaiso University. Public Service and Leadership Basic and advanced (18 or 30 credit) certificates are designed for individuals with liberal arts or professional degrees who are considering or currently working in government or the public and nonprofit sectors. Both programs include coursework in government, public communication, finance, social and public policy, research methods, and administration and leadership. The advanced certificate allows further specialization in one or more of these areas.   College of Adult Scholars 397 Liberal Studies Courses  /640 Senior Seminar in the Fine Arts 3 Cr.

GS 394,", Health Care Professional Apprenticeship (see page 67), is offered in the Summer I Session (see page 392) and is of interest to students in pre-medical arts. Details are given in a Summer Session announcement each year. Combined Liberal Arts-Medical Arts Program Students may complete the degree Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science from Valparaiso University by completing three years of study at this University and completing an additional year’s work at an approved school of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, medical technology, or other allied health disciplines. Prior approval of the program must be secured from the Committee on Pre-Medical Arts. Specifically, students who elect one of these programs must meet the following requirements: 1. They must spend the junior year in residence at Valparaiso University. 2. They must meet all General Education Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree with the exception that one course in theology is waived. 3. They must complete an academic major. For the Bachelor of Science degree this major must be in one of the science fields. 4. They must complete at least 93 semester credit hours of college work. 5. They must apply for graduation by the deadline date as noted at the front of this catalog and present to the Office of the Registrar an official transcript of an additional year’s satisfactory work at an approved professional school. Preparation for the Study of Law Students who plan to attend law school after graduation should select any rigorous course of study for their majors. According to the American Bar Association, "The ABA does not recommend any undergraduate majors or group of courses to prepare for a legal education. Students are admitted to law school from almost every academic discipline. Taking a broad range of difficult courses from demanding instructors is excellent preparation for legal education." Based on these ABA recommendations, Valparaiso University does not require Pre-Law students to follow a specific curriculum. Instead, students are encouraged to select a major that will be both challenging and interesting and that will help them develop strong research and writing skills. Additionally, students may choose from an array of elective courses on legal topics offered by several of the College of Arts and Sciences departments, including Communication, Political Science and International Relations, and Sociology. The College of Business also offers courses in business law. The presence of Valparaiso University Law School provides still more opportunities for Pre-Law students including access to a law library, frequent speakers of national and international prominence, and interaction with law faculty. Pre-Law students at Valparaiso University are encouraged to be active in the Pre-Law Program, which provides academic advising, guidance on law school admissions, and several programs, including the Law School Fair, Mock Trial Team, Visit Day at the Valparaiso University Law School, and Law Career Day. Students may also participate in the student-run Pre-Law Society. The combination of rigorous academic work and Pre-Law programming has prepared many of the University's graduates for placement in some of the finest and most prestigious law schools in the country. To learn more about the Pre-Law Program, visit the website at valpo.edu/prelaw or contact the program coordinator at James.Old@valpo.edu. Combined Liberal Arts-Law Program Students may complete their bachelor's degree from Valparaiso University by completing three years of study at this University and completing an additional three year's work at the Valparaiso University Law School. Thereby students may obtain in six years (twelve semesters) both the bachelor's degree and the Juris Doctor degree. Prior approval of the program must be secured from the Office of the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Students who elect this program must meet the following requirements before beginning the Law School: 1. They must satisfactorily complete all General Education Requirements for the bachelor's degree and an academic major. 2. They must satisfactorily complete at least 94 undergraduate credit hours. 3. At least one half of the credit hours for the major must be taken at Valparaiso University. 4. At least 75 credit hours, including the last 30 credit hours, must be taken at Valparaiso University. 5. They must have a grade point average of 3.000 in all undergraduate work at Valparaiso University. 6. They must be admitted to the Valparaiso University Law School through the normal admissions process. College of Arts and Sciences 62 7. They must complete a minimum of 30 credits in the Valparaiso University Law School with a grade point average of at least 2.000. 8. They must apply for the Bachelor's degree graduation by the deadline date as noted at the front of this catalog. Preparation for Seminary Graduates of Valparaiso University are accepted into the seminaries not only of The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod (LCMS) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), but also of other Protestant bodies, and into graduate divinity schools throughout the United States. (Students are encouraged to consult the web sites of divinity schools or graduate programs in theology or religion for specific admission requirements.) Recommended Preparation for Admission to M.Div. Program at LCMS Seminaries The LCMS seminaries in St. Louis, Missouri, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, recommend a bachelor's degree that includes a broad liberal arts curriculum and preferably the ability to read languages (especially German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew). Language skills can be acquired through courses provided at the seminary as well. Students accepted into the M.Div. program must pass the Entry Level Competency Examinations (Old Testament content, New Testament content, Christian doctrine, Biblical Greek, and Biblical Hebrew) before they can enroll in M.Div. courses. Valparaiso University offers courses in all of these areas of study through the departments of Theology and Foreign Languages and Literatures. Finally, both seminaries expect applicants to have taken courses to improve written and spoken English: English composition and writing, and speech (both writing and delivering). For Students Preparing for Admission to the Seminaries of the ELCA The eight seminaries of the ELCA offer a variety of post-baccalaureate degree programs, including the M.Div., which is the basic professional degree for those seeking ordination as pastors, and the M.A., which may be used to prepare for other ministries in and beyond the church (diaconal ministers, Associates in Ministry, and education). While specific requirements for admission vary, the following captures the typical academic prerequisites: 1. a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university (some seminaries specify the B.A. degree; others do not) with a cumulative GPA of 2.500-3.000 on a 4.000 scale; 2. a broad background in the liberal arts (English composition and literature, history, philosophy, psychology, the biological/natural and social sciences, and foreign languages); 3. some seminaries require up to two semesters of classical or koine Greek (which may often be met by means of a summer intensive language course). Beyond these academic requirements, another part of the application for admission to the ELCA seminaries addresses personal qualifications. Those interested in pursuing a rostered ministry in the ELCA should also begin to forge a relationship with their synod candidacy committee as they begin the application process. Students may be interested in the special articulation agreement with the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago, whereby they can earn a bachelor’s and master’s degree in a total of seven years (including internship). See “4+3 Option” under the Department of Theology (page 276) for details. Further information is available from the chair of the Department of Theology and on the department's web site: valpo.edu/theology. Arts and Sciences Pre-Engineering Program Applicants for admission to the College of Engineering may require additional work, usually in mathematics or the sciences, before admission is granted. Such students may be admitted to the pre-engineering program in the College of Arts and Sciences for this preparation if they are registered for, or have completed a college-level pre-calculus course. While in the program, pre-engineering students may take engineering courses if they satisfy the prerequisites and corequisites. Students in this program are expected to make progress toward admission into the College of Engineering in a timely manner. In order to enter the College of Engineering, pre-engineering students must have a cumulative resident grade point average of 2.000 or higher in each of the three categories listed in the College of Engineering Graduation Requirements section (page 322). Pre-engineering students who have not matriculated into the College of Engineering within three semesters will be removed from the program and will need to select another major within the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, or the College of Nursing. Students should contact the College of Engineering assistant dean for student success for details.   College of Arts and Sciences 63 Diaconal Education and Formation Process The University and the Lutheran Deaconess Association (LDA) cooperate in the education and formation of men and women for service in diaconal ministry. In response to a changing world, the LDA offers a process that allows students to express their Christian vocation through church, civic, or human service professions. Plans may be individualized, combining diaconal students with many academic majors, to earn a graduate or undergraduate degree. The education and formation process is under the counsel and guidance of the staff of the Lutheran Deaconess Association. Inquiries should be directed to the director of education and formation, Center for Diaconal Ministry, 1304 LaPorte Avenue, Valparaiso, Indiana 46383-9978. Phone 219.464.6925. Email: deacserv@valpo.edu. Application forms and fee schedule are outlined on the website: valpo.edu/lda. Students may apply during their sophomore year, but must be at least 20 years old or have junior standing. Week-long orientation and annual seminars are required during each year of the process. Diaconal students work with the LDA staff and academic advisors to determine a program of academic study, planned experiences, and reflection in these areas: 1. Spirituality Focus on personal and spiritual growth, which may include spiritual direction, discernment retreats, counseling, journal reflection, prayer, and worship. 2. Theology Academic courses cover these topics. Exceptions can be made with agreement between LDA and the student’s academic advisor. a. Biblical Studies, both Old and New Testament, or overview of the Bible; b. Church History, from the apostolic era through Reformation to present; c. Lutheran/Christian Theology; d.

Combined Liberal Arts-Engineering Program Students may earn in five years (ten semesters) both the Bachelor of Arts degree and one of the Bachelor of Science in engineering degrees. They may earn the two degrees by completing one of the engineering curricula and the General Education Requirements of the Bachelor of Arts degree as well as the major requirement of the College of Arts and Sciences. This requires them to earn at least 157 credit hours and to have a standing of at least 2.000 in all of their work. Students who elect such a program must have their schedules approved by both the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and the dean of the College of Engineering at the beginning of each semester. Sample or representative curricula for such programs may be obtained upon application to the dean of the College of Engineering. College of Arts and Sciences 64 Departmental Honors Work Honors Work is designated for students of exceptional ability who may benefit by earning a limited number of the credits required for graduation through supervised independent study rather than through regular course work. Students who apply for Honors Work should understand that their work will be evaluated according to the highest standards of scholarly achievement. Honors Work may be pursued by any student who is a degree candidate in the College of Arts and Sciences and whose major or program is administered by a department or an administrative committee within the college. Students may not pursue Honors Work as part of an individualized major. A student who has completed at least 80 credit hours, but has not yet entered upon the work of the last two semesters, and who has a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.000 and a grade point average in the major of at least 3.500 may apply through the major department or program committee for admission to Honors Work. To apply, the student must submit a plan for a major independent project that will be undertaken under the supervision of a member of the major department or program. The application form, which requires the student to articulate the independent project briefly, clearly, and with a timetable and modest bibliography, is available in the Dean’s Office. (For more information, please attend the Beyond Valpo program held annually during the spring semester.) This plan must be presented to the chair of the student’s department or program for approval and forwarded to the Dean’s Office no later than 12:00 p.m. on the first Monday of April of the student’s second semester, junior year. The dean will then forward the application to the Scholarship and Advising Committee for final approval. If the proposed independent study project is approved, the student should enroll in a course numbered 497 ”Honors Work in (the major department or program)’’ in the first semester of the senior year. A student who has been admitted to Honors Work must present four copies of a completed draft of the project to the chair of the major department (or program) at least ten class days before the beginning of the final examination period of the student’s first semester of the senior year. With prior approval, the student may substitute for the completed draft a status report demonstrating substantial progress (in certain areas, such as in the experimental sciences). In the case of a status report, the student should describe the work accomplished during the semester and the plans for continued work during the following semester. The project is then judged at midyear by a project committee consisting of the chair of the major department or program, the project advisor, one additional department reader, and one outside reader who is a member of the Scholarship and Advising Committee. If, based on the status report or draft, the project committee affirms the likelihood that the student will be able to conclude an exceptional piece of scholarship appropriate to the student's discipline by the end of the following semester, that student will be admitted to Candidacy for Honors. If the project has not progressed as had been expected (the student must earn an A or A- for the first semester), the student will be denied admission to Candidacy for Honors. The student should consult with the project advisor for departmental/program evaluation policy. If admitted to Candidacy for Honors, the student should register during the second semester of the senior year for a course numbered 498, “Honors Candidacy in (major department or program)” A student must complete the independent study project begun in the previous semester, incorporating additions or revisions suggested by the project committee to its satisfaction. Four copies of the completed project report must be delivered to the chair of the major department or program at least fifteen class days before the beginning of the final examination period of the student’s final semester. The original project committee shall then schedule an oral examination for the Honors Candidate to assess the student’s knowledge of matter covered in the independent study project and any other closely related matters deemed appropriate by the project committee. The Honors Candidate shall be notified beforehand of the related matters to be included in the examination. If, in the opinion of the project committee, the candidate is worthy of honors, it shall recommend to the dean that the student be awarded three credit hours with a grade of A or A- for course numbered 498 and be graduated “With Honors in (the major field).” If the candidate is not deemed worthy of honors, the Office of the Dean, upon consultation with the project committee, may recommend that the student be granted three credit hours for Independent Study in the major department or program, with a grade determined by the project committee. Two copies of the final project report will be given to the Dean's Office for archival purposes. During the semester or semesters of engagement in Honors Work, a student is not allowed to carry more than 12 credit hours in addition to Honors Work. A student whose major requires completion of a senior project may register for Honors Work in lieu of the departmental senior project course, after securing permission from the department chair. The same procedures as outlined above must be followed. Cooperative Education Cooperative Education in the College of Arts and Sciences is a program in which students combine professional, paid, work experience with academic programs. Students may be employed in full-time (called alternating) or part-time (called parallel) placements. Normally, a semester of full-time employment will earn a maximum of 3 credit hours; a full-time summer employment, a maximum of 2 credit hours; and a part-time (parallel) placement requiring a minimum of fifteen hours per week, 1 credit hour. Parallel placements of fewer than fifteen hours per week may be given 0.5 credit hours. Students will normally complete a minimum College of Arts and Sciences 65 of two alternating or four parallel work assignments. The program is available through various departments as well as through the general offerings of the college. The college’s general program is intended both for undeclared majors who are able to use cooperative education on an exploratory basis and for declared majors who may wish to participate outside their major department on an elective basis. The following policies govern Cooperative Education within the college: 1. The student works under the advisement of a faculty member who monitors the work experience, evaluates the required written reports by students, and assigns the course grade. 2. A student is eligible upon completion of two semesters of enrollment in residence with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.500. Co-op is open to students upon completion of the freshman year. 3. Placements require prior approval of the coordinator of cooperative education-- retroactive credit will not be granted. 4. Course credits count as electives toward graduation or, in certain academic departments where specified, count toward the department’s major or minor. 5. No more than a combined total of 12 credit hours earned through cooperative education, internship, field experience, or other work experiences may be applied toward the meeting of minimum graduation requirements. Exceptions may occur in certain departments due to professional certification requirements. Additional restrictions may apply in departments where the cooperative education credits count toward major or minor requirements.

Note: For possible exceptions to this list, please contact Professor Peter Johnson.  Honors College Students invited to participate in the program of Christ College take all required engineering courses, as well as courses required in the honors program. Because Christ College courses replace certain non-engineering courses, the College of Engineering-Christ College combination normally requires only four years for completion. Christ College courses provide an enriched program in the humanities and satisfy General Education Requirements for the engineering program. Academic advisors are assigned for both the College of Engineering and Christ College. Engineering students invited to join Christ College are strongly urged to accept the invitation. International Experiences Various optional programs are available through which engineering students may obtain improved understanding of and appreciation for the history, geography, language, culture, and engineering practices of other nations. In addition to the study opportunities described beginning on pages 13 and 20 of this catalog, engineering students are permitted to arrange an international cooperative education assignment. A four-week summer study abroad experience is also available for engineers in Reutlingen, Germany and will be offered on an annual or bi-annual basis.   College of Engineering 322 Valparaiso University International Engineering Programs (VIEP) VIEP is a five-year program that combines a major in one of the four engineering fields with a major or minor in German (VIEP - German), French (VIEP - French), Spanish (VIEP - Spanish) or a minor in Chinese (VIEP in China).

Special Freshman Program activities include drama, music, and debate. Christ College 285 Upper Class Admission Students with superior records of academic achievement may be invited to join Christ College later than the start of the freshman year at the dean’s discretion. For example, some sophomores are admitted to Christ College each fall. These students enroll in sophomore level Christ College courses and begin the pursuit of Christ College Scholar graduation distinction. Still other students enroll in one or more courses offered by the college, but do not pursue honors program designations. Such enrollment is subject to the approval of the dean and limited only by class size. Any Valparaiso University student--whether or not he or she is a member of Christ College--may pursue a complementary major or a minor in humanities through Christ College coursework. Transfer Admission Christ College welcomes students transferring to Valparaiso University from other colleges and universities, especially if students have taken honors courses at their previous institutions, including at junior colleges. A transfer student should discuss interest in Christ College with the transfer admission coordinator and speak with the dean of Christ College. The Student must submit the Application to Christ College. If approved, an academic advisor from Christ College will determine, in consultation with the student and the major advisor, which Christ College courses would best fit the student’s needs and interests. Typically, a transfer student who has fulfilled the general education requirement of the two semester, 10 credit Freshman Core, may earn Christ College Scholar honors by completing a minimum of 16 credit hours of CC courses numbered 200 and above, plus one additional 3 credit seminar (CC325). Membership in Christ College A student formally admitted to Christ College, either as a freshman or upper class student, in order to pursue a Honors distinction, is designated a member of Christ College. Once admitted to membership, a student’s status is regularly reviewed by the dean and faculty to determine whether the student is satisfying the standards appropriate to membership in the Honors College. These requirements include contribution to the common life of the college, satisfactory academic progress toward a degree in one of the undergraduate colleges, and continuing academic achievement consonant with the mission and standards of Christ College. Even when students are not directly registered in Christ College courses during a given semester, they are expected to contribute to the College’s common life. This includes attendance at the Christ College Symposium and regular consultation with a Christ College advisor. Continuing academic achievement at the honors level includes 1) a cumulative grade point average of 3.300 in all coursework completed at the University and 2) a cumulative grade point average of 3.300 in all coursework completed in Christ College. Students who fall below these standards at the end of a semester or academic year will be notified by the dean and reminded that Christ College Scholar distinction requires a 3.300 cumulative average for work in both Christ College and Valparaiso University. In some cases students will be asked to meet with their advisor and/ or the dean to discuss their status, and may be counseled not to continue in Christ College. However, continuing membership in Christ College is not determined solely by particular criteria such as cumulative grade point average or the student's academic record for a particular semester or year. The dean and faculty consider the complete circumstances and direction of each student's total academic career and role in Christ College, and retain the right to maintain or terminate a student's membership in Christ College in light of these conditions. The final approval for those who graduate with the designation of Christ College Scholar is made by the dean upon recommendation of the faculty. The dean and faculty take an interest in the total program of every member of Christ College, and seek to enhance the quality of educational experience for each individual student. Accordingly, the dean may authorize certain variations in the normal academic requirements of a student if such variations seem desirable in the best interests of the student. For example, the dean may permit a student to carry extra credit hours and to waive certain University requirements if such waivers are justified. Members of the college are normally expected to meet all University requirements for graduation except where such modifications have been explicitly authorized by the dean. In general, the faculty may tailor a program to meet a student’s interests and needs within the general framework and spirit of the University’s requirements. Academic Advising and Approval of Course Schedules Advising of students pursuing programs in Christ College is under the general direction of the Christ College academic advisor. Christ College freshmen are usually advised by a member of the Christ College faculty. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors are advised by the associate dean, with faculty members available to consult at any time. Students are encouraged to confer regularly with their Christ College advisors to select courses, to meet University and college graduation requirements, to assure orderly progress in their chosen programs, and to assist in career planning and related matters. Christ College 286 In addition to a Christ College advisor, students have an advisor in the other college in which they are simultaneously enrolled, and are expected to confer regularly with that advisor as well. It is each student’s responsibility to know curriculum requirements, academic policies, deadlines for academic actions, and Christ College membership criteria. Programs of Study Completion of the degree requirements of the college in which the Christ College student is concurrently enrolled leads to the bachelor’s degree appropriate to that college. In addition, a member of Christ College, by meeting the appropriate requirements, may graduate as a Christ College Scholar. The transcript carries the notation along with an explanation of its meaning. Christ College students as well as students who are not members of Christ College may pursue a complementary major in humanities or a minor in humanities through the college. Christ College Scholar The requirements for this designation are: 1. Membership in Christ College for a minimum of three semesters. 2. A cumulative grade point average of 3.300 in all coursework completed at the University and in all coursework completed in Christ College for the Scholar designation. 3. A minimum of 16 credit hours beyond the Christ College Freshman Program courses .

Davis, Eberhardt (chair), Scaglione-Sewell, Swanson, Watters; Associate Professors Bouyer, Bugajski, Dick, Scupham; Assistant Professors K. Iceman, Orozco-Nunnelly; Lecturer S. AmRhein. Biology is the disciplined study of living organisms. It is also a vital part of liberal education, enabling students to develop an appreciation of their own biological nature as well as of the great variety of organisms and communities of organisms with which they come into contact and upon which they are dependent. The study of biology may be at many levels: molecular, cellular, organismic, population, community, ecosystem, evolutionary. The department offers instruction at each of these levels designed to meet the requirements for graduate study, for professional schools, and for teaching careers in biology or for working in industrial or governmental positions. The Biology Department is housed in both the Neils Science Center and the new Center for the Sciences, teaching-research facilities with state-of-the-art equipment such as advanced research light microscopes and an electron microscope. Nearly all biology courses have a laboratory component and all field or laboratory classes are taught by professors or other experienced faculty. The department makes extensive field trips for its organismal biology laboratory courses to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, which ranks third of all national parks in species diversity, and at other distinguished natural history institutions in the Chicago area. Biology majors are encouraged to conduct research under the supervision of faculty members. Majors also have opportunities to study abroad at the University’s overseas centers or at affiliated institutions as well as at recognized programs sponsored by national laboratories and other distinguished institutions. Pre-Medical Arts Programs A major in biology is an appropriate preparation for admission into professional schools and programs such as medicine, dentistry, hospital administration, medical technology, optometry, physical therapy, podiatry, public health, veterinary medicine, and other allied health fields.

Jantzi (chair), Schoer; Assistant Professors C. Iceman, Pruet, Rowe, P. Smith; Lecturer Leach. Chemistry is the discipline that studies the fundamental nature of matter and the changes in energy and properties accompanying compositional changes in matter. As a scientific discipline, chemistry is firmly rooted in the liberal arts tradition, placing emphasis on the development of intellectual capability and judgment. Yet it is also a very practical discipline dealing with the fundamental technology of matter that affects our environment and our society. Because of the nature of the discipline, a wide diversity of careers is possible with a chemistry major. These range from industrial product development to academic research, from medical and paramedical careers to forensic (law enforcement) chemistry. Government, industry, schools, and universities and many private institutions, such as museums, have a variety of openings for chemists. About two-thirds of Valparaiso University’s chemistry graduates continue their education in graduate, medical, or professional school. In almost every instance, those who go to graduate school receive complete financial support in the form of a fellowship or an assistantship. The programs of the department provide balance between theoretical and practical aspects of chemistry. Opportunities for carrying out directed or honors work research are available. A wide selection of instruments is maintained for student use in instructional laboratory work and research. The department is approved by the American Chemical Society for the training of professional chemists, including the biochemistry option, and the Beta Sigma Chapter of the Phi Lambda Upsilon Chemistry Honorary Society is located here. A student may choose to work toward a Bachelor of Arts degree or a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry or a Bachelor of Science degree in biochemistry. Pre-Medical Arts Programs A major in chemistry or biochemistry is an appropriate preparation for admission into professional schools and programs such as medicine, dentistry, hospital administration, medical technology, optometry, osteopathy, physical therapy, podiatry, public health, veterinary medicine, and other allied health fields. Further information may be obtained from the chair of the department or members of the Committee on Pre-Medical Arts. Chemical Engineering The College of Engineering offers a minor in engineering.

Objectives The Gender Studies Minor offers an interdisciplinary perspective on the lives of women and men, especially on the nature of social and cultural constructs that give meaning to the biological difference of sex. The fact that persons are male and female takes on a complex of meaning that can be explored through study of literature and the arts, religion, history, society and social institutions, the professions, human psychology and development, and life sciences. This program, by including courses that study women in culture, society, and history, and that include the best of a growing body of feminist theory and research, also intends to help correct a tradition of scholarship and teaching that has ignored the contributions and concerns of women. Overall, the program will give both men and women a better sense of identity and possibility, and will foster greater understanding of the complex ways in which we, for good and for ill, are influenced by culture and society.

Administration This program is administered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in consultation with the Department of Computing and Information Sciences. Students who complete the Data Science major will have fulfilled the major field requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree. Data Science is considered an interdisciplinary program. See page 369 for more information. Objectives A data scientist analyzes complex systems and solves real world problems through the analysis of data, and in particular, very large sets of data. Many scientific disciplines, our economy, and even our providers of streaming entertainment increasingly rely on data. According to the Data Science Association, components of the field of Data Science include “predictive/ prescriptive analytics, algorithm design and execution, applied machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization.” Because of the interdisciplinary nature of Data Science, a student wishing to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Data Science must take courses in Data Science and from the partner disciplines of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Additionally, students should explore an area of application through selection of one or more courses from an appropriate field, as described below. Students are strongly encouraged to take a minor or a second major in their applied field of interest. Bachelor of Science ‒ Data Science Major (Minimum 41 Cr.) Statistics Courses 9-10 Cr.

Economics provides a logical ordered way of looking at problems, issues, and policies regarding the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. It draws upon other social sciences and mathematics to confront a wide range of topics from environmental abuse to economic growth, to business regulation and other governmental interactions with the commercial world. As economics in general deals with choice and decision making, it is of great value on both a personal and a professional level. Economics majors have a wide range of career choices, including government or business economist, banking economist, investment analyst, trade association economist, and others.

MATH 115,", or placement higher than  in the Math Placement process, or one of   See page 371 for a description of the Applied Statistics Minor. Teaching Programs Students who plan to teach mathematics in middle or secondary schools with a major or minor in Mathematics should consult the chair of the department and the Education Department for specific requirements. Cooperative Education Qualified students may combine semesters of professional experience with other semesters of traditional academic studies, usually lengthening their college education beyond the normal eight semesters. During the semesters of their employment, students are financially reimbursed by the cooperating employer and receive college credit. This program normally commences at the end of the sophomore year and consists of two semesters plus three summers of full time employment with the same company. Two credits in mathematics are granted for each semester and one for each summer. These credits may not be counted toward the minimum required for the major and cannot replace a required course, with the exception of  Trigonometry and Functions 2 Cr.  (See paragraph on Placement.) 7 weeks. Topics will include trigonometry in the plane, trigonometric functions, simple vector geometry, functional concepts and notation, and an introduction to parametric equations and polar coordinates. Coursework is distributed both in-class and on-line. This course may not be used to fulfill the General Education Requirement in the College of Arts and Sciences nor be counted toward a major or minor in mathematics. Prerequisite: Grade of C- or higher in , or placement higher than  in the Math Placement process.  Trigonometry and Functions 2 Cr. Healthy Lifestyles 1 Cr. One of the following options:  : Trigonometry and Functions and : Trigonometry and Functions cannot get an F in that class but then proceed to Calculus I anyway by (re)taking the math placement assessment. To take the math placement assessment, visit valpo.edu/mathematics-statistics/academics/ap-credit-and-math-placement. Note that more than one attempt at the placement assessment is possible, so a first try does not necessarily give a final placement result.   408 Registration Visit the Office of the Registrar online. All students are expected to register on the official registration days of each semester. For students currently enrolled, a registration period is announced during each semester. (For the registration days and the calendar of the Law School, consult that School’s bulletin.) Health Requirement All students entering the University for the first time and all students who have not been registered at this University for a full semester (excluding summer) must submit to the University Health Center a report of their medical history, physical examination, and required immunizations from a licensed physician. Maximum and Minimum Credit Hours A full-time student is one who is registered for at least 12 semester credit hours. Maximum credit hours allowed per semester without a petition are given in the following table: Program Maximum Credit Hours College of Arts and Sciences 18 Cr.  Education (Elementary, Middle Level) 18 Cr.  Secondary Education 19 Cr.  Bachelor of Music 18 Cr.  Bachelor of Music Education 19 Cr. College of Business 18 Cr. College of Engineering 19 Cr. College of Nursing and Health Professions (except in approved block schedules) 18 Cr. Students who maintained a grade point average of 3.000 (B) or better during the previous semester may register for extra hours, provided that their formal petitions for such work are granted. This petition must be approved by the academic advisor and the dean of the appropriate college. Forms are available online through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. Freshmen are not allowed to carry extra hours during the first semester. Extra credit hours above 19 credits per semester will also incur an additional tuition charge (see page 417). Course Prerequisites Students are held responsible for meeting the prerequisites of all courses for which they enroll. In unusual cases, a student may petition to waive a prerequisite. Such a petition must be approved by the instructor of the course and/or the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Change of Schedule Students may change their registration in courses up to the time of the calendar deadlines published in the GENERAL CATALOG. Such changes are matters of serious consideration. Before deciding on such an action, students should obtain the counsel of their course instructor, academic advisor, and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. Forms are available online through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. Any student-athlete who wishes to drop below 12 semester credit hours (full-time status) must obtain permission of the athletics compliance coordinator or designee. Deadlines for course addition, course withdrawal, filing for S/U grade, and withdrawal from the University are published in the University Calendar. Once these deadlines have passed, students are held responsible for completion of courses under the terms of the registration they have selected. Changes in registration after these deadlines are allowed only in exceptional cases where students demonstrate that extreme contributory circumstances have rendered their registration in a course invalid. Serious physical disability, prolonged illness, or the death of a loved one: documented occurrences of this kind can be considered reasonable grounds for requesting an exception to the regular calendar deadlines. A petition for exception to a deadline may be addressed to the dean of the appropriate college; such a petition must be accompanied by supporting reasons for its presentation. Petition forms are available online through the Office of the Registrar: valpo.edu/registrar. The integrity of the Valparaiso University transcript and ultimately of the University itself demand that special exceptions be permitted only when special circumstances prevail. Neither unsatisfactory academic performance, whether caused by inability or lack of application, nor lack of adequate evaluation of a student’s performance in a course before the deadline are, in and of themselves, sufficient reason for petition. Registration 409 Students may officially cancel enrollment in a course during the first six class days without reflection on their permanent record. All requests for adding a course during the first six class days remain at the discretion of the appropriate academic dean or department chair. From then until the published deadline, a student may officially withdraw from a course with a grade of W (withdrawal) on the student’s permanent record. Students are not permitted, without an approved petition, to cancel enrollment in courses after the end of the ninth week of a semester. Not attending class does not constitute formal withdrawal from a course. After the drop/add period and until the tenth week of a semester, the tuition fee is prorated for students withdrawing from the University. The refund schedule can be viewed online through the Student Financial Services: valpo.edu/student-financial-services. Courses dropped before the drop/add period (sixth class day) will receive 100% refund. Appeals Denial of a petition by a student’s dean may be appealed to the Committee on Academic and Professional Standards. The appealing student should append reasons for submitting his appeal to the committee.   410 Academic Policies Learn more about Academic Policies online. Grading System and Quality Points For the Law School and the Graduate School, refer to the appropriate bulletin. The course grades reported and recorded in the Office of the Registrar are as follows. The corresponding number of quality points per credit hour are also indicated. Grade Quality Points/Cr. A Excellent 4.000 A-  3.700 B+  3.300 B Good 3.000 B-  2.700 C+  2.300 C Satisfactory 2.000 C-  1.700 D+ Less than satisfactory, but passing 1.300 D Passing 1.000 D-  0.700 F Failure 0.000 I Incomplete --- IP In Progress --- W Authorized withdrawal --- S Satisfactory --- U Unsatisfactory --- Grade Point Average is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of graded credits. GPA calculations are truncated to three decimal places and never rounded. Grades A through D– give credit toward graduation. A student who receives a grade of D– in a course is advised not to enroll in other courses for which the given course is a prerequisite. Candidates for graduation must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.000 or better in all their work at Valparaiso University. The grade I (incomplete) may, at the discretion of the instructor, be given to a student under the following conditions: 1. The work completed in the course so far is passing. 2. The student has been unable to complete the remaining work in the course because of circumstances beyond his or her control. An I (incomplete) grade received in one semester or summer session must be removed by the beginning of the official examination period of the next succeeding semester, or it automatically becomes a grade of F. The student’s deadline for submitting the outstanding work to the instructor shall be one week before that date. No Semester Honors will be given if the student received a grade of Incomplete at the official end of the semester concerned. Students who are not registered in the next term (Fall or Spring) who are finalizing work from an Incomplete grade will need to complete a Campus Affiliation request. Authorized withdrawal from a course or from the University within the published deadlines gives the grade of W to each course withdrawn. This mark carries no credit. The satisfactory grade, S, is given under the following conditions: 1. The course is designated in this catalog to be graded S/U, or the student officially opts or petitions to have the S/U grade in the course. 2. The student’s work in the course is satisfactory, of a quality which is comparable to a grade of C- (1.700 quality points per credit hour) or better. Course credit hours with grades of S count toward graduation but are not counted in computing the student’s grade point average. The unsatisfactory grade, U, is given under the S/U grade option (condition 1 above) when the student’s work does not meet the course objectives (condition 2 above). Course credit hours with grades of U do not count toward graduation and are not counted in computing the student’s grade point average.   Academic Policies 411 The failing grade, F, is given under any of the following circumstances: 1. Work done in a course is below a minimum standard required for passing. 2. A student fails to complete work to remove a grade of I (incomplete) before the deadline stated above. 3. A student stops attending a course without filing the necessary form and obtaining the necessary approval. 4. A student stops attending the University without giving official notification. F grades are given in all courses for that term. To withdraw from a course students should submit the withdraw request on DataVU using the “Withdraw from Sections” link. After the withdraw deadline, students may submit the appropriate appeal to the Committee on Academic and Professional Standards. Withdrawal from the University requires notification to the Office of Student Affairs. The appropriate form is obtainable from that office. Admission to Courses on a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Basis Undergraduate students are encouraged to venture outside the areas of their concentration, investigate new disciplines, and discover new, perhaps unsuspected, interests. If a student chooses, the Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading option may reduce the anxiety about electing a course in an area in which the student has had little or no prior experience. Students who are interested in conveying maximum information on their transcripts to professional and graduate school should speak to their advisors and the dean of their college prior to electing this option. Certain courses normally result in the S/U grade, as noted in the catalog course descriptions. In addition to any of these courses, the student may take one course, normally letter graded (i.e., A to F), each semester on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis subject to the following conditions: 1. Such courses must not be selected from: a. The student’s major or minor field or fields; b. A repeated course, if not originally taken on the S/U basis; 2. Students in the professional colleges may choose the S/U basis for free electives (if not taken in the major or minor fields) and for courses which fulfill their general education requirements in Core, Humanities, Social Science, Theology, Foreign Language, Diversity, or Kinesiology. For further regulations regarding the S/U option for business students, please see page 292. 3. Such petition must be signed by the student’s academic advisor; 4. A decision to elect a course on the S/U basis must be made by the deadline specified by the Office of the Registrar in the Important Dates document for the applicable term. After this deadline, the S/U grading basis may not be changed. NOTE: In selection of the S/U option, students are strongly advised to discuss the implications of that option with their advisor concerning entrance into professional schools. Admission to the Course Intensification Plan Students may propose a special project for earning one extra credit in one liberal arts course in which they are enrolled in a given semester. In addition, students enrolled in the College of Business (see page 292) and the College of Nursing and Health Professions (see page 351) have specific criteria for course intensification of their courses. This opportunity is part of the University’s course intensification plan. The following regulations pertain to this option for all students regardless of their college: 1. The course must be offered for three or more credits. Variable credit courses cannot be intensified. 2. The initiative and responsibility for developing a satisfactory proposal lie with the student. 3. Student must complete a Petition to Intensify a Course, available online through the Office of the Registrar. 4. The proposal must be approved by the student's advisor, the instructor of the course, the chair of the department, and the dean of the student's college. 5. Approved proposals must be filed in the Office of the Registrar during the period specified in the academic calendar. The course intensification plan is a type of honors work, and under no circumstances should be considered a substitute for regular course work. Admission to Courses as an Auditor A regularly classified student may register in a course as an auditor only with the permission of his or her advisor and the chair of the department which offers the course. Deadlines to apply to audit a course are published in the calendar at the front of this catalog. An auditor may not be admitted to the final examination and is never granted credit for the course audited. No additional fee is charged when the student pays full tuition up to 19 credit hours. Any credit hour over 19 will be subject to the overload fee as published. Once in a course as an auditor, the student cannot change the status of his or her enrollment to receive a regular grade in the course.   Academic Policies 412 Credit Hours A credit hour (abbreviated Cr. in lists of courses) represents one hour of recitation or lecture, or two or more hours of laboratory, each week for one semester. If time outside the laboratory is required to prepare laboratory notes or reports, two hours may be equivalent to one period of class work. Drawing, shop work, and other courses demanding no outside preparation require a minimum of three hours for one credit hour. See specific course descriptions for the exact number of hours required. For short (seven weeks) courses, the time per week per credit hour is twice that for the semester. Repetition of Resident Courses for Credit Unless repetition of a course for credit is permitted as shown in its catalog description, only the credits, grade, and quality points received the last time the course is taken by a student at Valparaiso University shall be used in determining credit for graduation and the cumulative grade point average. A grade of W shall be excluded from this policy. The student’s transcript shall record all grades, original and repeat. Academic Standing of a Student A student’s academic standing is determined by the ratio of the total number of quality points to the total number of credit hours attempted in all work at Valparaiso University, except courses graded S/U. Thus, a student who makes an average mark of C (2.000 quality points per credit hour) throughout the course of 124 semester hours will have 248 quality points, 124 credit hours, and a standing of 2.000. The standing for a semester’s work is understood to be the ratio of the number of quality points earned to the number of graded credit hours completed. Standing is also referred to as the grade point average. Both cumulative and semester GPA are factors in determining a student’s academic standing. At least a 2.000 GPA is required for good academic standing. Criteria vary by college and program. Please refer to the applicable sections of the GENERAL CATALOG for details. Note the above exception regarding repetition of a course. For information regarding satisfactory academic progress, please see page 429 in the Financial Aid section. Academic Deficiency In the College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business, College of Engineering, and College of Nursing and Health Professions, students whose cumulative resident grade point average falls below the requirements of their college and program (at least 2.000) are considered academically deficient. Such students may be denied the privilege of continuing their studies at the University unless they succeed in improving the quality of their academic work to the satisfaction of the faculty during the following semester. The dean of each college establishes procedures to give students who are academically deficient timely warning of their being denied continuation of their studies. The GPA requirement varies by college and program. Please refer to the applicable sections of the GENERAL CATALOG for details. For regulations concerning academic deficiency in the Law School, see that School’s bulletin. Dismissal for Low Scholarship Whenever, in the judgment of an academic dean, students who are academically deficient would benefit from an interruption of their work in a particular college of the University, the dean will notify the students in writing that they have been dismissed and will specify the period of time for which they have been dismissed and the conditions which they must satisfy in order to be readmitted. Class Standing of a Student An undergraduate student must have successfully completed 24 semester credits to be classified as a sophomore; 56 semester credits to be classified as a junior; and 88 semester credits to be classified as a senior. A student in the Law School should consult that School’s bulletin. Classification of Courses The courses offered by the University are classified as follows:  Lower division courses, numbered 100-299;  Upper division courses, numbered 300-499;  Graduate-undergraduate courses, numbered 500-599;  Graduate only courses, numbered 600 and above.   Academic Policies 413 Leave of Absence – Undergraduate Students At the end of a semester, a student who has completed at least one full semester of work in residence and who is in good academic standing may apply for a leave of absence. A leave of absence requires approval of the academic advisor and the academic dean. The necessary form may be obtained online through the Office of the Registrar. All leaves must be requested before the beginning of the semester in which they are to take effect. An approved leave of absence cannot exceed 180 days in any 12-month period. Leaves are not granted to students who withdraw from the University during a semester. Students on leave may return to Valparaiso University without formally applying for readmission, provided they resume attendance on or before the 180 days following the start of the leave of absence. Students who are unable to return from a leave may contact the Office of the Registrar for information on returning at a later date. The Office of the Registrar should be contacted for information pertaining to a military leave of absence. Readmission of Former Students to Undergraduate and Professional Programs Students who have fully matriculated at Valparaiso University and who have interrupted their studies for whatever reason must apply for readmission to the University. The request for readmission is to be sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. Exceptions are students who took a formal leave of absence under the conditions specified above and students enrolled in the Diaconal Education and Formation Process, who usually spend one year in in-service training. Cooperative Program work semesters and off-campus special semesters are considered to be continuation of study, for which students have officially registered. Application for readmission must be made at least one week before the start date of the term in which the student wishes to enroll. Applications will not be accepted after this date. The student being readmitted must present the necessary information such as records of attendance and grades at other colleges, and a new medical examination report if the student has been out of school during the previous sixteen month period, before action will be taken on the request to be readmitted. Credit hours earned more than fifteen years before application for readmission (either at Valparaiso University or at another accredited institution) are subject to reevaluation and, if accepted by the appropriate University standing committee, may be subject to validation by the first year’s work (30 semester credits) completed in residence with a 2.000 grade point average. The case of each student applying for readmission is presented to the Office of Undergraduate Admission for consultation with the college of which the student is seeking readmission. The Office of Undergraduate Admission then notifies the student of the readmission decision. Students with outstanding financial obligations to the University are not considered for readmission until these obligations have been paid in full. Advanced Standing—Resident Students Any resident student who has taken academic course work at any other accredited educational institution must request the Registrar of that institution to send an official transcript to the Valparaiso University Office of the Registrar, where an evaluation is made for possible acceptance of transfer credits. Courses with grades of C- or above are accepted for transfer credit. Grades are not transferable; only credit transfers. "

Professors Belanger, Buinicki, Byrne, Hanson, Juneja, Ruff; Associate Professors S. Anderson, Burow-Flak, Danger (chair), Schuette; Assistant Professors Potter, Sévère, M. Wagenaar; Lecturers Grantz, Jack. The English Department offers a variety of courses for both English majors and other students. These courses help students to use the English language maturely and sensitively and to develop their capacities to enjoy and understand imaginative literature. Many non-English majors enroll in upper division courses, and students can expect any class to display a spectrum of interests and backgrounds. Relatively small class size allows students to cultivate a close relationship with professors and to sharpen their analytical and expressive skills through writing and discussion. In addition to preparing a student for graduate work or for teaching in secondary schools, an English major provides an excellent qualification for numerous careers and professions. Many schools of medicine, law, and theology view an English major as highly desirable for acceptance into their programs. Businesses, not-for-profit agencies, and government offices employ English majors for positions in human resources, sales and marketing, public relations, systems analysis, and advertising, as well as editing and writing. The abilities to read and understand complex material, to write and speak precisely, to think clearly, thoroughly, and subtly remain in high demand. All students with an interest in literature are invited to join the English Society. Students of exceptional merit earn membership in Sigma Tau Delta, a national honor society, and may qualify for departmental scholarships. English elementary and secondary education majors may join the Valparaiso University affiliate of the National Council of Teachers of English. Bachelor of Arts – English Major (Minimum 33 Cr.) "

DeMaris, Duvick, Tomasik (chair); Associate Professors Ames, Hoult-Saros, Malchow, Miguel-Pueyo, Zamora-Breckenridge; Assistant Professors Fuchs, Karas, Kavanagh, Lien, López Martín, Simon; Clinical Assistant Professor Jennings; Lecturers Berrier, Cochran. To study a foreign language is to see the world through the eyes of another culture. In our increasingly global community, knowledge of a foreign language and awareness of transcultural issues are crucial for all citizens of the world. Foreign language study is thus an important facet of any area of University study. The Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures offers a diverse range of courses that not only teach students to express themselves in another language but also allow them to explore other literary and cultural traditions, both past and present. By immersing themselves in these other traditions, students gain insight into their own language and culture while deepening their understanding of what it means to be human, a central concern of the liberal arts. The department provides students with linguistic and cultural skills that can be effectively applied in their chosen professions, as well. A major or minor in a foreign language prepares students for success in a variety of careers ranging from international business, education, law, and government service to social work, the ministry, translation, and medical professions. Learning Objectives Students pursuing study in foreign languages and literatures will work toward the following objectives: 1. Students will attain a high level of language proficiency. In the modern languages, this proficiency includes reading, writing, listening, and speaking; in the classical languages, reading and writing. Reading: Students will comprehend and interpret a variety of texts. Writing: Students will write clearly and effectively in a variety of genres (e.g., narrative and persuasive essays, personal and business correspondence, and literary analysis). Listening and Speaking: Students will communicate effectively with native speakers in both formal and informal verbal contexts. 2. Students will recognize important authors and literary movements and will analyze and appreciate key literary texts, thereby becoming critical readers of literature. 3. Students will demonstrate knowledge of and appreciation for the relevant culture, both past and present. 4. Students will find, evaluate, engage with, and correctly cite sources of information in both the target language and in English, mindful of how these sources support their own academic work. Foreign Languages Across the University In addition to language majors and minors, the University offers a variety of programs that incorporate the study of a foreign language: Certificate in Business Spanish Chinese and Japanese Studies Enhanced International Business in German Global Service International Business International Economics and Cultural Affairs Latin American and Latino Studies Pre-Seminary Program Secondary Education Valparaiso International Engineering Program (VIEP) in China Valparaiso International Engineering Program (VIEP) ꟷ French, German, and Spanish Study Abroad Through University programs and affiliations, an opportunity to study abroad is afforded students of any of the foreign languages. Foreign language majors and minors are strongly encouraged to study abroad. See page 20 for details.   Foreign Languages and Literatures 143 Placement and Special Credit Before beginning the study of a foreign language already studied in high school, students are required to take a placement examination administered by this department. Students who wish to begin languages they have not studied before must register for course 101 of those languages. Those students must complete level 102 to fulfill the foreign language requirement. Students who have completed Level II of a foreign language in high school and also place into 101 of that language may enroll in 101 for elective credit only, but must complete level 203 to fulfill the foreign language requirement. Students who place directly into level 203 of a language shall receive 4 credit hours for level 102 and 4 credit hours for level 203 when they pass course 203 at Valparaiso University. Students who place directly into level 204 or higher in a language shall receive 4 credit hours for level 102, 4 credit hours for level 203 and the credit hours for the course into which they have placed when they pass this latter course at Valparaiso University. Students who have taken the equivalent of level 203 at another institution will not be awarded retroactive credit. However, they will have fulfilled their Valparaiso University foreign language requirement. Advanced Placement by Examination It is possible to fulfill the Foreign Language General Education Requirement through the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board or through the College Level Examination Program. Special Exceptions to Foreign Language Requirement International students whose native language is not English and who are studying on a nonimmigrant visa are exempt from the foreign language requirement provided that they have successfully completed  Colloquium on Environmental Science and Management 1 Cr. Note: No more than two courses for this minor may overlap with other requirements whether within general education or within requirements for any majors or other minors. Other appropriate topics courses may be substituted for requirements with the approval of the coordinator.  Ethnic Studies Administrative Committee: Professor Kilpinen (Geography and Meteorology, coordinator). Objectives The Ethnic Studies Minor offers an interdisciplinary perspective on race, ethnicity, and culture, especially on the nature of historical and social constructs that define group and individual experiences, attitudes, and identities. The focus of the minor will be on the following North American ethnic groups: African-American, Chicano/Latino, Native American, and Asian-American. The objectives of the minor have two complementary components. One, more narrowly academic, aims at helping students develop critical thinking using a multicultural perspective with reference to their own backgrounds and those of others, and with materials from within and without the traditional canon. The other, more social and experiential, involves becoming familiar with and appreciating diversity among students and the larger community. Both aim at providing knowledge and understanding which will Interdisciplinary Programs 375 help students reach across racial and cultural barriers and equip them to function effectively, both professionally and personally, in a multicultural and multiracial world.

Geography Geography studies the Earth and its diverse people and environments. It seeks to understand how humans perceive and transform places and landscapes around the world. Geographers also explore and analyze the spatial organization of natural and social phenomena by creating and analyzing maps with computerized geographic information systems (GIS). Geography students learn to integrate knowledge from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities in order to understand humanity's relationship with the Earth. Geography uniquely combines a strong liberal arts education with marketable professional skills. The major integrates dynamic classroom instruction with field and professional experience to prepare students for a wide variety of careers. Students completing the major may go on to careers in environmental management, urban planning, geospatial technology, cartography, location planning, real estate, tourism, marketing, demography, natural disaster preparation and recovery, international business, emergency management, social studies education, or earth science education to name just a few areas. Combining geography with a second major or pursuing graduate study in geography can enhance a student's opportunities. Geography majors also pursue graduate study in other areas including urban planning, architecture, landscape architecture, environmental science, resource management, climatology, oceanography, geology, archaeology, anthropology, law, or medicine. The Geography major at Valparaiso University emphasizes practical experience through field trips, field courses, internships, and opportunities to work with faculty on original research. Students taking physical geography courses regularly visit the nearby Indiana Dunes National Park to learn about dune formation and biodiversity. Students studying urban geography and planning take a short train ride into Chicago to experience the dynamism of the downtown Loop and to observe everyday life in its diverse neighborhoods. In field courses, students use the environment as their classroom; learning about glacial processes while hiking on a glacier in Alaska or about natural hazards by visiting volcanoes in Hawaii. Most geography students complete a paid or unpaid Geography and Meteorology 160 internship with national parks, urban planning agencies, Indian reservations, environmental organizations, non-profit organizations, and businesses. Many geography students also complete one of Valparaiso University's study abroad programs or the Chicago Urban Studies program. Motivated students may arrange to work with a faculty member on original research problems or work as a lab assistant for physical geography and GIS courses. Outside the classroom, students share their love for geography through the Geography Club, which organizes professional and social activities, weekend field excursions, and guest speakers. Students who distinguish themselves by high scholarship may be elected to membership in Gamma Theta Upsilon, the international geography honor society. The Alpha Xi Chapter of Gamma Theta Upsilon was installed at Valparaiso University in 1950. The geography program at Valparaiso University has access to state-of-the-art facilities including the F.P. Kallay Geographic Applications Laboratory, an extensive map library located in the Christopher Center, and media-equipped classrooms in Kallay- Christopher Hall. Bachelor of Arts - Geography Major (Minimum 30 Cr.)

Meteorology The atmospheric science course of study at Valparaiso University leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in Meteorology. The science of meteorology draws heavily on the fields of mathematics, physics, computer science, and chemistry. As such, students should possess a strong mathematics and science background. The required major courses prepare every student in the foundations of atmospheric science. The elective courses reflect the diverse nature of the science, enrich each student’s academic experience, and prepare them for post-graduate careers. The job market in meteorology, like the field itself, is rich and diverse. Many graduates enter employment with airlines, private forecasting and environmental consulting firms, or the National Weather Service. Others pursue professional opportunities with the U.S. Air Force through the University's Air Force ROTC program (see page 385). Still others pursue careers in research and academia, which require graduate training. Valparaiso University graduates have gone on to many of the finest meteorology graduate programs in the country. Broadcast meteorology represents another promising career sector, and many meteorology graduates have achieved success in this field. There is considerable demand nationwide for trained professionals able to communicate meteorological information effectively and accurately, either through the broadcast media (cable, television, and radio) or in association with various consulting firms. Students prepare for this field through hands-on training and experience in broadcasting in the VUTV studios in Schnabel Hall and through internships at a variety of broadcast stations across the country, including WGN-TV in Chicago. Those interested in careers in broadcast meteorology should complete a Bachelor of Science degree in meteorology and a Digital Media Minor through the Department of Communication (see page 97).    Geography and Meteorology 163 Students interested in extracurricular learning opportunities are encouraged to participate in the student chapter of the American Meteorological Society/National Weather Association, with the Valparaiso University Storm Intercept Team (VUSIT), and avail themselves of the program's field course opportunities, including the Severe Convective Storms Field Study.

Professors Rittgers, Schaefer; Associate Professors Carter, Ostoyich (chair), Seguin, Xia; Visiting Assistant Professor Schwartz Francisco. One of the central disciplines of the traditional liberal arts, history is concerned with understanding the development of societies and cultures which produced the world as we know it. The historian operates under the assumption that the past is of fundamental importance in today’s decision-making and in formulating tomorrow’s dreams. History provides a solid major for those with career goals in law, teaching, journalism, government, and the ministry. Combining a history major with a Fundamentals of Business Minor has proved to be a popular alternative for those who have strong interests in history and who plan to pursue a business career. Since the history student integrates materials from the social and behavioral sciences, literature, philosophy, religion, and the arts, history is also a field for students who view the undergraduate years as a time to explore a variety of subjects.

Associate Professors Geiman (chair), Preston; Assistant Professor Woodward. Philosophy is the oldest academic discipline, and the one broadest in scope and application. Courses in philosophy examine the big, foundational questions that have animated great thinkers in both Western and non-Western civilizations, such as the following: What is the right way to live? How should society be structured? What is the relationship between human beings and the rest of the natural world? What is ultimately real, and what is its nature? How is knowledge about these, as well as more mundane matters, to be obtained? The study of philosophy tends to develop and sharpen students’ analytical and critical thinking skills, not only in connection with topics traditionally deemed ‘philosophical,’ but in all areas. That’s why philosophy majors tend to outperform all other humanities majors, and in many cases even STEM majors, on tests such as the GRE, LSAT, and GMAT. Philosophical training has proven to be a “secret weapon” for leaders in many other fields including business, law, government, the military, and ministry. Thus, philosophical coursework naturally accompanies and enhances study in virtually any other field. Philosophy can also help Christians and members of other faiths think critically about various issues relevant to their religious commitments. VU philosophy majors have gone on to top law schools and graduate programs in business, medicine, linguistics, and, of course, philosophy. But even for those students who do not plan to pursue graduate study, a degree in philosophy is a prudent choice. Because of their exceptional critical thinking and communication skills, the employment rate of recent philosophy graduates exceeds those of any other humanities majors, and is comparable with that of graduates in business management, computer science, education, and chemistry.

Professor Lin; Associate Professors Atchison, Hora, G. Johnson (chair); Assistant Professors Feld, Old. Historically, political science has occupied a central position in liberal arts. The study of politics focuses on the values that humans should seek and the particular legal and structural organizations that allow us to realize our desired values. Contemporary political science combines this concern for normative issues with an additional focus on scientific procedures and empirical and quantitative methodology. The study of politics and international relations has never been more important than today. More so than ever before, events that occur across the globe and in remote places around the world impact our daily lives. As a result of revolutionary technological change, relations within and between states are being reconfigured almost daily. The majors in Political Science and International Relations at Valparaiso University give students the background, experience, and analytical tools to make sense of, and prepare for dealing with this dynamic and rapidly changing world. A major in political science may lead to careers in many fields including, but not limited to, law, criminal justice, business, education, government service at the state, national, local, and international level, politics, policy analysis, campaign management, and work for private interest groups. Many political science graduates eventually go on to law school and other graduate programs. The department sponsors a series of informal events where a variety of topics are discussed. The department also recognizes outstanding student achievement through membership in the Beta Nu Chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha, the national political science honor society. Special Programs For information concerning the Lutheran College Washington Consortium Semester see page 13. Community Research and Service Center The Department of Political Science and International Relations has established the Community Research and Service Center.

Bioengineering Program Overview Bioengineers analyze and design solutions to healthcare problems involving both biology and engineering. Typically these engineers design equipment, materials or software, or develop new procedures that will improve the quality and effectiveness of patient care. The Bioengineering Major offers three possible concentrations: Biomechanicals, Bioelectrical, or Biomedical. The biomechanicals and bioelectrical concentrations focus more heavily on an engineering foundation while the biomedical concentration includes additional science courses and is the main option for those engineering students interested in attending medical school after graduation. Courses are sequenced to build upon a firm foundation in mathematics, basic sciences, and engineering sciences. Courses progressively involve students in engineering design activities and culminate in a major interdisciplinary design experience during the final year of study. Alongside technical issues, design activities address economic, safety, environmental, sustainability, product development, and social factors.

Associate Professor Ringenberg (chair); Assistant Professor Barden; Clinical Associate Professor Crumpacker Niedner. The Department of Social Work offers the Bachelor of Social Work (BSW) degree. As sought after human service professionals, social workers seek to promote human and community wellbeing. Guided by a person in environment construct, a global perspective, respect for human diversity, and knowledge based on scientific inquiry, social work’s purpose is actualized through its quest for social and economic justice, the prevention of conditions that limit human rights, the elimination of poverty, and the enhancement of the quality of life for all persons (Council on Social Work Education, Educational Policy Accreditation Standards). Social Work is concerned with empowering people to develop capacities and strengths that will enhance social functioning. Our BSW graduates are prepared for generalist social work practice in a wide variety of settings. Alumni of our program are highly marketable and are employed in mental health services, schools, hospitals, elder care, churches, shelters, corrections, child welfare, and other social service agencies. Our graduates often pursue the Master of Social Work (MSW) degree within five years of earning their BSW and are eligible to apply for advanced standing in many MSW programs. Advanced standing typically offers students who have earned a BSW the opportunity to complete their graduate degree in two to three semesters, rather than the typical two years. Accreditation The Department of Social Work is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE) which is recognized by the Council for Higher Education as the sole accrediting agency for baccalaureate- and masters-level social work education in the United States. Mission Valparaiso University’s mission as a community of learning dedicated to excellence and grounded in the Lutheran tradition of scholarship, freedom, and faith, prepares students to lead and serve in both church and society (VU Mission). Our Social Work Department mission grows out of this University mission in that we provide a rigorous and stimulating educational environment characterized by a dynamic interchange between faculty and students that promotes critical thinking, conscious use of self, and active engagement in the learning process. Our vision is to foster the creation of coherent and integrated educational learning experiences that utilize an active learner model, valuing different ways of knowing, aimed at preparing students for generalist social work practice that will: • address the whole person in the context of their environment; • be informed by an ecological/systems and strengths perspective; • be actively involved in advocacy, empowerment, and social change; • serve vulnerable and oppressed people; • implement culturally sensitive practice strategies; and • contribute meaningfully to society by valuing service, social and economic justice, the dignity and worth of each person, importance of human relationships, and integrity and competence in all areas of generalist practice. As a values-based profession, it is critical that those who pursue an education and career in social work be aware of and ascribe to the core values of the profession as outlined above. Purpose The purpose of the Department of Social Work is to educate and prepare students for ethical, effective, and culturally competent generalist social work practice for service in the world. The program uses a competency-based educational model and outcome performance approach to curriculum and co-curricular design to meet this purpose. Admission Policies and Procedures Students who wish to major in social work must declare this intention with the University registrar and complete the departmental admissions process.  University-Level Process First-year students who enter the University with a declared social work major need take no further action at the University level. Students who wish to transfer from either another department or an exploratory major must complete the proper University-level paperwork to declare a social work major and submit it to the Office of the Registrar no later than May 1st of their sophomore year.   Social Work 256 Department-Level Process Both students who enter the University with social work as a declared major and students who change majors must complete the departmental admissions process no later than September 30th of their junior year. In order to have the process completed by this date, it should be initiated as soon as possible after entering the University or declaring the social work major with the University registrar. The departmental admissions process is fully explained in the admissions materials which must be obtained from the Department of Social Work office in 102 Heidbrink Hall. Requirements for formal admission include: 1. A strong desire to serve while promoting human and community well-being. 2. A cumulative overall University grade point average of 2.000. 3. A cumulative grade point average of 2.500 in Department of Social Work classes. 4. Completion of all essays and paperwork included in the admissions materials which must exhibit college-level writing skills. Should any piece of writing submitted with the admissions application not meet faculty expectations for quality, it will be returned to the applicant for re-writing. 5. A formal interview with a member or members of the social work faculty. In exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted to the department with a cumulative grade point average lower than 2.000 and/or a social work grade point average lower than 2.500. In such circumstances, a student would be admitted to the department on conditional major status and encouraged to raise their overall grade point average to 2.000 and/or their social work department grade point average to 2.500 in order to remain a social work major. Academic Progression Standards In order to remain a social work major and progress through the program, students must maintain a cumulative grade point average of 2.000 and a social work department grade point average of 2.500. Should a student’s grade point average fall below these requirements, she/he will be placed on conditional major status and will be allowed up to December of the junior year to raise the grade point average to the required standards. Failure to reach the required grade point average after this time frame on conditional major status will result in dismissal from the major. Should a social work major earn an F in a course in the social work major, she/he will be allowed to retake the course one time in order to earn a passing grade. Failure to earn a passing grade the second time taking a course will result in dismissal from the major. Field Education in Social Work Field education in social work sets our graduates apart, as this experience fosters the integration of empirical and practice-based knowledge and promotes the development of professional competence. The field component is systematically designed around program educational competencies and is supervised and evaluated according to stringent criteria established by the Council on Social Work Education. Field Education consists of educationally directed internships in a variety of community settings. In order to graduate with the Bachelor of Social Work degree, social work majors are required to successfully complete two internships- a 100-hour internship in the spring semester of their junior year and a 450 hour internship over the entirety of their senior year. These internships are sequential and must be completed in conjunction with specific coursework. Junior Internship Admission & Progression Standards The first required field internship takes place during the spring semester of the junior year. Screening of students for admission to the field practicum begins in the fall semester of the junior year. Social work majors must meet the following criteria in order to be considered for placement in a junior internship: 1. Successful completion of the foundation-level social work curriculum which consists of: "

Associate Professors D. Bartusch (chair), Lavin-Loucks, Yogan; Assistant Professor Raridon; Visiting Assistant Professor Blake. The Department of Sociology encompasses the disciplines of sociology, criminology, and anthropology, and seeks to provide a broad-based understanding of the organization and dynamics of human society and culture. Its subject matter ranges from intimate family life to the complex ways social institutions shape behavior, from crime to religion, from the divisions of social class to the shared beliefs of a common culture. Its primary focus is on social relationships and social structures in a wide variety of cultural and social settings. The department’s programs seek to help students achieve awareness of the world in which they live, and of the causes and consequences of human social behavior. Its basic objective is to help students understand themselves, the groups in which they participate, as well as the dynamics of everyday life. By expanding their knowledge of the field, its theories, concepts, and research methods, and by acquiring insights to their world from the study of different peoples and cultures, students develop skills in social analysis, enhance their capacity for self-evaluation, and grow in their ability to make informed judgments about key social issues in a multicultural society. To achieve these objectives, the department has developed a curriculum grounded in the liberal arts tradition that is flexible and responsive to student needs. While all majors are required to enroll in a core of basic sociology courses, the curriculum provides coursework that prepares students for a range of intellectual, professional, and occupational interests. Students who major in sociology may elect to concentrate either in general sociology or criminology. The department also offers minors in both general sociology and criminology. Sociology Concentration The general sociology concentration is intended for students interested in understanding society and social behavior. The sociology concentration can lead to careers in administration in a variety of community, government, and social service agencies, market research, or other vocations that require an understanding of the dynamics of human relationships in a multicultural society. The concentration also prepares students for graduate study in sociology and/or law. Students who seek careers involving agency administration should consider the Fundamentals of Business Minor (page 371). Criminology Concentration Students who are interested in the study of crime and criminal behavior are encouraged to concentrate in criminology. This concentration encourages students to think critically about crime, law, and justice. Students will complete coursework in subjects such as juvenile delinquency, criminological theory, policing and society, or the sociology of law. Students must complete at least one internship during their junior or senior year. International Honor Societies The department encourages qualifying students to join honor societies in sociology and the social sciences. Such organizations recognize outstanding scholarship and achievement. There are two international honor societies for which majors in the department may qualify. First, the department sponsors the NU Chapter of the international honor society in sociology, Alpha Kappa Delta. Second, the department, along with other social science disciplines at Valparaiso University, supports Pi Gamma Mu, the international honor society in social science.   Sociology and Criminology 263 Bachelor of Arts – General Sociology Major (Minimum 33 Cr.)

The Theology Department of Valparaiso University has as its main purpose the study, transmission, and interpretation of the Christian tradition as a part of and in relation to the wider religious heritage of humankind. It is the goal of the department to enable all graduates of Valparaiso University to be knowledgeable of the Christian faith, sensitive to religious issues in our global society, and prepared for roles in which their understanding of religion may enhance their contribution to church and society. Since this is a theology department within a university, our work is founded upon the liberal arts tradition of inquiry; competing ideas meet and are freely debated in the search for truth. The Theology Department plays an essential part in expressing and defining the University’s commitment to the Christian tradition, particularly to the Lutheran perspective. The department seeks to assist its students in becoming more aware of their own religious traditions, more critical and affirming in their appropriation of them, and more respectful of other traditions.

Howard, Schwehn, VanZanten; Associate Professors Jakelić, Prough, Smith; Assistant Professors Graber, Puffer, Upton; Lecturer Western; Visiting Assistant Professor C. Wagenaar; Adjunct Assistant Professors Creech, A. Howard. Christ College is the honors college of Valparaiso University. Established in 1967, Christ College celebrates over fifty years of providing honors-level liberal arts education that integrates fields of study and enables students to achieve a measure of intellectual independence. Christ College students are concurrently enrolled in one of the University’s undergraduate Colleges--Arts and Sciences, Business, Engineering, or Nursing and Health Professions--where they earn their bachelor’s degrees. Study in Christ College complements all academic programs, providing stimulating interdisciplinary study in the humanities with master teacher-scholars and academically talented students. Many Christ College courses fulfill the University’s General Education Requirements. Completion of a program of study in Christ College leads to graduation with the honors designation Christ College Scholar. A student may also earn a complementary major or an academic minor in Christ College humanities coursework. Requirements for these programs are described in detail beginning on page 286. Christ College is dedicated to the cultivation of intellectual, moral, and spiritual virtues. The college’s name suggests its compatibility with Valparaiso University’s definition of itself as a university in the Christian intellectual tradition, comprised of people of many faiths and beliefs. Christ College endeavors to develop among its members a sense of community: a community of seekers of knowledge and truth, a community within which free inquiry is encouraged and principled commitment is fostered, a community of scholars engaged in preparing themselves for active participation in the larger human community. Much of the curricular structure of Christ College and many of its co-curricular activities are devoted to developing this sense of community. Its attractive facilities also encourage community-building. Christ College is located in Mueller Hall, a modern building in the heart of campus where students and faculty interact in seminar-sized classrooms, a 60-seat multimedia lecture hall, a comfortable lounge/ art gallery, a landscaped courtyard, a multipurpose refectory, and faculty offices. By developing an academic community that gathers outside as well as inside the classroom, Christ College promotes a particular set of educational virtues and ideals among its members. Among these are direct and personal relationships between students and faculty, a spirit of cooperation and mutual growth through free exchange of ideas, a willingness to challenge and scrutinize ideas and beliefs (including one’s own), and a concern for the integration of academic learning into a responsible and meaningful life. While stressing intellectual excellence and the fullest use of one’s own mental gifts, the college also attempts to develop within its members the virtues of modesty and civility, a humble awareness of limitations and failures, and a sense that the more knowledge is gained, the more it is to be used wisely in the service of others. To the extent that these values are actually realized in its members, Christ College considers them prepared for responsible vocations in society and for leadership and service in their faith communities. Admission and Membership in Christ College Freshman Admission To be considered for membership in Christ College beginning in the freshman year, students must first be admitted to Valparaiso University. Admitted students with superior academic records, strong SAT or ACT scores, proven leadership in extracurricular activities, and a measure of curiosity and creativity are invited by the dean of Christ College to apply for the honors program. Between 90 and 100 freshmen are accepted into the Christ College Freshman Program each fall. The Christ College Freshman Program ("

Mission The mission of the College of Business is to cultivate values-based leaders in a dynamic and global environment. The general education curriculum exposes each student to a broad range of disciplines, problem solving techniques, and methods of inquiry. The business curriculum introduces students to concepts, tools of analysis, and techniques of evaluation which further develop skills in problem solving and decision making. These serve as a foundation for their growth into competent and ethically responsible business persons prepared for work in the global environment. The undergraduate education in business is concerned not only with preparation for business careers but with preparation for life in general. As the shared values indicate, “We view students as whole persons and strive to prepare them for personal, as well as professional success.” The Major Field The business core provides background in the production and marketing of goods and/or services and the financing of the business enterprise; it builds on the knowledge gained in the general education component.

Objectives Engineering is the art of applying scientific and practical knowledge to the solution of problems for the benefit of society. The curriculum integrates scientific and engineering principles, practical laboratory and computer experiences, engineering design experiences culminating in a major design project, and liberal learning in the tradition of Christian church-related colleges and universities. Special emphasis is given to communication skills, the humanities, and the social sciences. Students are enriched by participation in the academic, social, cultural, and spiritual life that is central to the Christian academic tradition at Valparaiso University. Graduates are prepared both for direct entry into the practice of engineering and for graduate school. The Academic Programs Bachelor of Science degrees may be earned in Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The goals of these programs are to build a strong foundation in mathematics, the natural and engineering sciences, and to provide an introduction to engineering design during the early portion of these programs. This is followed by courses with increased emphasis on engineering applications, design, teamwork, and interdisciplinary activity. Instruction in engineering design is integrated throughout the curriculum so that students advance toward higher levels of competence culminating in a senior design project which emphasizes formulation of problem statements and criteria, consideration of alternatives, and communication of results. The laboratory program provides for firsthand observation of physical phenomena, experience in data collection and analysis, verification of designs, written and oral communication, and teamwork. The use of computers in both the classroom and laboratory is fully integrated into the curriculum starting in the first semester. History Civil engineering topics were taught at Valparaiso University beginning in 1859. Sisters Ethel and Merle McCall were the first women engineering graduates each receiving civil engineering degrees in 1915. Full four-year programs were established in 1920, with offerings in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. During World War II, with the shortage of male students, the program was temporarily reduced to two years at Valparaiso University followed by two years at Purdue University. After the war, four-year engineering programs were reinstated on campus through the initiative of students who raised funds and then designed and built a new engineering laboratory building. The first post- World War II degrees were offered in 1951 in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering and have been accredited since 1958. The Indiana Delta Chapter of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society, was chartered in 1963. In 1968, the College of Engineering moved to the newly-constructed Gellersen Engineering and Mathematics Center. This facility was provided through the generosity of the late William A. Gellersen of Oakland, California. The building, located on the southeastern edge of campus, contains faculty offices, classrooms, and laboratories for the College of Engineering, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. The optional cooperative education program was initiated in 1983 and the first group of cooperative education students graduated in 1986. In 2003, the Computer Engineering program was accredited. The college added a fifth program, Bioengineering, in the fall of 2017. Accreditation for this program will occur after the first graduating class.   College of Engineering 317 With the beginning of the 2011-2012 academic year, the Donald V. Fites Engineering Innovation Center, a new state-of-the-art facility, was made available to College of Engineering students. It honors one of Valparaiso University’s most prolific graduates for his contributions as CEO and Chairman of the Board for Caterpillar Incorporated. The Fites Center is an approximately 14,000 square foot high-performance building, which houses innovative laboratory, design, and meeting spaces that foster faculty-student interactions. In 2013, it was awarded LEED® Platinum established by the U.S. Green Building Council and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute. LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) is the nation’s preeminent program for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. The James S. Markiewicz Manufacturing and Projects Center forms a physical link between the Gellersen Engineering and Mathematics Center to the north, and the Fites Center to the south. The Markiewicz Manufacturing and Projects Center includes the Projects Laboratory and the James S. Markiewicz Manufacturing Suite. The James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research Facility became operational during the 2013-14 academic year. This facility provides engineering students with extraordinary laboratory and research experiences involving concentrated solar energy to create commodities and fuels. Both the Manufacturing Projects Center and the Solar Energy Research Facility are named after James S. Markiewicz, '72 ME, whose generosity made these spaces possible. College Organization Administratively, the college is an instructional unit under the direction of the dean. The five programs, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, are directed by the faculty of the three engineering departments under the leadership of department chairs. Accreditation Bachelor of Science degree programs in Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. www.abet.org. Bioengineering will apply for accreditation after the first graduating class of students. Admission Requirements The requirements for admission of first-year students to the college are listed on page 398 of this catalog. Students who do not meet the mathematics and science requirements for admission to the College of Engineering may be admitted to the Pre-Engineering Program in the College of Arts and Sciences as described on page 62.

Amounts due the University are payable in full one week before the beginning of each semester. Before the beginning of each semester, students will receive a Student Account Center advanced billing notice to their University email address. Payment instructions are available in TMS. The Advanced Billing Statement will include charges based on current registration at the time of billing, financial aid, and balance due for the coming semester. The student will need to adjust the balance due for pending charges anticipated for special course fees and for outside scholarships not appearing on the Advanced Billing Statement. Amounts to be earned through campus employment will not be deducted, as these are paid directly to the student through the University's payroll system. Payment for the adjusted balance due must be made by August 15 for fall charges and December 31 for spring charges unless the student has enrolled in a tuition payment plan (see "Educational Expense Payment Plan" below). Each student registering at Valparaiso University assumes responsibility to pay all University-related expenses not covered by financial aid. Students who do not have sufficient financial aid, are not already enrolled in a monthly payment plan, and have not paid their initial semester charges (tuition, general fee, room and board) by the semester due date will automatically be charged a $100 late payment fee. An account restriction will also be placed on the students’ accounts that will suspend student services. Students who withdraw from the University must make arrangements to meet all outstanding financial obligations to the University. Examples of such obligations are tuition and fees, room and board, library fines, health fees, parking violations, etc. The student’s transcript is not released until payment of all obligations has been made. Each graduating student must pay any remaining financial obligations to the University before graduation. No degree is conferred upon and no transcript is given for a student whose account with the University has not been settled in full. Loans such as the Federal Perkins Program or Valparaiso University Student Loans become due as stated in the promissory note signed by the student. Transcripts are not released to students who are in arrears on these loans. Delinquent Accounts Each student registering at Valparaiso University assumes responsibility to pay all University-related expenses not covered by financial aid. Students who have not secured sufficient financial aid, who have a delinquent or insufficient monthly payment plan, and/or have not paid posted account charges after 30 days will be considered delinquent. If a satisfactory plan is not arranged, or if payments are not made in accordance with the payment plan and due dates, the entire balance shall be immediately due and payable, and the University has the right to take steps to collect the balance, including, but not limited to, the following:  excluding the student from classes and other campus services;  withholding course grades, academic transcripts, and diploma until the balance is paid;  turning the student's account over to a collection agency; or  taking legal action to collect the balance due. The student authorizes the University to release financial information about his/her account and other information useful in verifying the charges on the account to those concerned with collecting the balance due. In the event of collection efforts, procedures, or a suit to collect unpaid balances on the student's account and/or institutional loans, the student agrees to be charged and pay all of the University's fees for collections, including legal fees, not to exceed 50% of the entire outstanding balance. Delinquent accounts may be reported to credit bureaus and bear interest at 6% per annum. Educational Expense Payment Plan Valparaiso University partners with a third party provider to offer a deferred payment plan for the convenience of those students and parents who may wish to spread payment over the semester. Under the plan, monthly payments may be arranged for the payment of tuition, fees, room and board. The payment plan provider offers a plan for each semester. The enrollment fee is $30 for the semester plan. Payment plan accounts with delinquent or past due payments will receive a $100 late payment fee charged to the student's account. A link to an explanation of the plan will be included with the fall and spring advanced billing statement notices that are emailed to the student's University email address prior to the start of each term.  421 Housing Regulations Learn more about Housing Regulations online. Valparaiso University is residential by design. Living on campus represents an integral component of the mission of the institution by providing living and learning experiences which lead to a student’s growth and development, and an enhancement of one’s total education at Valpo. Because the residential experience is such an important aspect of the overall Valpo experience, Valparaiso University has a three-year residency requirement. All undergraduate students are expected to reside in campus housing for six (6) semesters. Exceptions are made for veterans, those who will be 22 before September 1 of the academic year in question, those living with parents, spouse, or legal guardian (commuter students), and sophomore and junior fraternity men who live in recognized fraternity houses. All sophomore and junior students who return from their fall semester of international studies or other cooperative off-campus programs are required to live in University operated residence halls during the spring semester. Graduate, and law students may apply to live in University residence halls, however, first priority is given to undergraduate students. The University reserves the right to deny housing to individuals who are not full-time undergraduate students. The Office of Residential Life also maintains a listing of rooms in private homes, apartments and homes for sale or rent. Students desiring such accommodations should plan to visit the campus at least six weeks before the semester of enrollment to inspect the available listings and make arrangements with the individual landlords. Every landlord whose property is listed has signed a nondiscrimination statement. The University is not involved in arrangements between students and landlords, except in the event of racial discrimination. The University provides a listing service only and does not inspect, approve, recommend, or authorize any off-campus living units. Commuter Students Although students are normally required to live in University residence halls, an exception is made for commuter students. A commuter student is defined as a full-time, undergraduate student who lives exclusively in the permanent or primary residence of a parent or legal guardian within "reasonable distance" of Valparaiso University. For students matriculating in the fall of 2018 and later, reasonable distance is defined as 30 or fewer miles. Students who otherwise would be required to live on campus may not reside at another off-campus address after registering as a commuter student. Questions related to this policy should be directed to the Office of Residential Life. Application New Students will complete an Online Housing Agreement application during their summer orientation program (FOCUS). At this time they will have the opportunity to preference residence halls and submit roommate requests. All returning students who are required to live in University residence halls according to University housing regulations must complete an Upper-class Housing Agreement form each year. Assignment Policy New freshman and transfer student assignments are made by the Office of Residential Life in the order in which their New Student Enrollment Agreements and deposits are received according to space availability. Returning upper class student assignments are made according to the guidelines established by the Office of Residential Life. Assignments are made with the goal of establishing and developing positive residence hall communities. All upper class housing agreements received before the deadline indicated by the Office of Residential Life will be given equal consideration as outlined in the instructions for the assignment process. The University will endeavor, but cannot guarantee, to assign accommodations according to the preferences indicated by the student. Any request for a change in residence hall assignment must be submitted in writing and approved by the Office of Residential Life. Residential Life adheres to the Valparaiso University non-discrimination policy in all of its programs, practices, and policies. Room assignments and changes are made without regard to race, color, or national origin. The University reserves the right to make changes in residence hall assignments if necessary for the most effective accommodation of the student body. Occupancy The University Housing Agreement is binding on the student for the fall and spring semesters of the designated academic year. Students who breach the residency requirement of the Housing Agreement, without prior written approval, will be responsible for the entire amount of the Agreement. Housing Regulations 422 Students may cancel the Housing Agreement only for the following reasons: graduation, authorized off-campus academic programs, withdrawal, marriage, or circumstances that are determined by the University, in the University’s sole discretion, to be an “Authorized Reason.” The Housing Agreement cannot be terminated solely for the purpose of living off-campus, because they match one of the exemption criteria mid-year, or to commute from home. Documentary evidence is required to demonstrate cause for cancellation. Depending on the reason for cancellation, students may be subject to a cancellation fee of up to $400. Students shall remain liable for room charges until written notice is received and cancellation approval is given by the Assistant Dean of Students for Residential Life or their designee. Vacation Periods The residence halls close at 12:00 noon on the day following the last day of classes or final exams prior to the Thanksgiving, semester, and spring breaks. The halls reopen at 12:00 noon on the day prior to resumption of classes following the Thanksgiving and spring breaks, and at 12:00 noon on the day prior to official spring semester registration and orientation activities following the semester break. Residence Hall accommodations are available during vacation periods for international students and other residents who meet certain criteria. Contact the Office of Residential Life for more information. Roommate Preferences should be listed on the housing application. All roommate requests must be mutually indicated by both students. New students are notified in July of their roommate assignments. Arrival at the residence hall for new students and new transfer students should coincide with the first day of orientation activities. All students are expected to report immediately to their assigned residence halls when they arrive on campus. Furnishings All rooms in the University residence halls are provided with the necessary basic furniture. Occupants supply their own bedding, pillows, towels, lamps and floor coverings if desired. Washers and dryers are also provided within each residence hall. Draperies are provided. Further information is available from the Office of Residential Life. University residence halls are staffed by full-time professional residential learning coordinators, undergraduate paraprofessional assistant coordinators, and resident assistants. All students residing in University owned residence halls are financially responsible for damage to rooms, furnishings, and equipment. Residence Hall staff members report such damage to the Finance Office and the student or the parent is billed for the cost of repair or replacement. Dining Locations and Dining Plans Dining Locations The primary venues for undergraduate dining are located in the Harre Union which features two dining locations, the Founders Table and the Campus Café. In addition, Grinders coffee shop is located in the Christopher Center. Founders Table is located on the east side of the Harre Union and is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner Monday through Friday, as well as for brunch and dinner on Saturday and Sunday. Founders Table features a wide variety of offerings, which include four display cooking stations that offer ethnic, vegetarian, and home-style favorites: The Chef's Corner features creative dishes with whole meal options; The Grill offers many all-time favorites such as chicken tenders, fries, burgers, and more; Sizzle provides unique choices such as stir-fry, pasta, and panini sandwiches; and the Brick Oven features pizza and specialty subs baked in a Wood Stone oven.

Grinders is open late most evenings and serves a wide variety of specialty coffee drinks from Starbucks, a deli sandwich bar, and a variety of grab and go items, including pastries, salads, and wraps.   Housing Regulations 423 Dining Plans Dining Plans are all à la carte, which means all items are purchased on a declining balance and are priced on an individual basis. Students begin each semester with a set amount of dollars for purchasing à la carte items and are not limited to a fixed number of meals. À la carte plans provide flexibility when making meal purchases, as students only pay for what they choose to eat, when they choose to eat. All students living in residence halls, who are freshman, sophomore, or junior classification, other than sorority members living in Scheele Hall, are required to purchase the Dining Plan associated with the student's classification. Students are required to purchase a meal plan until they have reached senior classification. The mandatory rates are posted on page 418. The dollars remaining, after the reduction of a $100 administrative fee, may be used to make purchases in the University's dining facilities. Student ID cards have the Dining Plan encoded and are used for purchases at University dining locations. All Dining Plans require two semesters of buy-in. Unused balances will be rolled over from the fall semester only and added to the spring semester buy-in as long as the student has purchased a plan for the spring semester. The rollover amount is automatically added to the student's account. If a student does not sign up for a spring plan, then they forfeit the remaining dollars. Unused balances at the end of the spring semester are not refunded or carried over. Dining plans are non-refundable. If a student has special dietary needs such as medical restrictions or vegetarian/vegan diets, they can be accommodated by contacting the Dining Services online at valpo.edu/dining, by email at dining@valpo.edu, or in the dining office located in the Harre Union, room 170.   424 Refund Policy Withdrawal From All Classes If, for whatever reason, a student needs to withdraw from Valparaiso University during the fall of spring semester, they may be eligible for a prorated refund of their tuition and room charges according to the following schedule: During the add/drop period 100% During the second week of classes 90% During the third week of classes 80% During the fourth week of classes 70% During the fifth week of classes 60% During the sixth week of classes 50% During the seventh week of classes 40% During the eighth week of classes 30% During the ninth week of classes 20% During the tenth week of classes 10% After tenth week of classes None  The unused meal plan credit is refundable throughout the semester. The refund amount equals the balance of the unused contract less a ten percent administrative fee. There will be no refund of general, special, and laboratory fees. The date of withdrawal and basis for calculating all refunds will be the date on which the student notifies the Office of Student Affairs of their intent to withdraw from the University, provided the withdrawal form is completed and submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the end of the next working day. Each semester, a schedule of the applicable refund dates is available in the Finance Office, the Financial Aid Office, and the Office of the Registrar Adjustment of Financial Aid Due to Complete Withdrawal The University and/or the student may be required to return some of the federal financial aid, if any, awarded to the student. If the student received financial aid from state, University, or private funds (other than family), a portion of the refund may also be returned to the grant, scholarship, or loan source from which it was received. The above refund schedule will be used to adjust institutional aid. The federal "Return of Title IV Funds" formula dictates the amount of Federal Title IV aid, other than Federal Work Study, that must be returned to the federal government by the school and the student. For students receiving Indiana State grants, if full time status is not maintained through the end of the fourth week of the semester, the University must return 100% of those funds to the state. Federal “Return of Title IV Funds” Formula: If a student withdraws on or before the 60% point of the semester, the percentage of funds that must be returned to the federal government is equal to the number of calendar days remaining in the semester, divided by the number of calendar days in the semester. Scheduled breaks of more than four consecutive days are excluded. The calculation of the return of these funds may result in the student owing a balance to the University and/or the federal government. Note: If funds are released to a student because of a credit balance on the student's account, then the student may be required to repay some of the federal grants if the student withdraws. Students considering withdrawing from all classes should consult with the staff in the Student Accounts and/or Financial Aid Offices if they are concerned about the financial impact of withdrawing. Dropping Courses Tuition charges will be reassessed at the end of the add/drop period. There will be no adjustments to tuition for courses dropped after the add/drop period. There will also be no refund of the special, laboratory, or general fees. The financial aid award, if any, will be reviewed at the end of the add/drop period and, if needed, will be adjusted to reflect enrollment at that time. Unofficial Withdrawals If a student does not successfully complete any courses during a given semester, their federal aid may need to be adjusted. If the University cannot document that a student attended at least one course past the 60% point of the semester, federal aid will be adjusted according to the “Return of Title IV Funds” policy above. The date used in that calculation will be the mid-point of the given semester unless a later date can be documented.  425 Financial Aid Visit the Office of Financial Aid online. The Office of Financial Aid at Valparaiso University is committed to providing resources necessary to help students complete their education. As such, we place primary emphasis on the student’s academic achievement and financial need. Financial aid consists of scholarships, grants, loans, and campus employment, which may be offered to a student singly or in various combinations. The family of a student is expected to make a maximum effort to assist with college expenses. For more information about financial aid programs, contact the Office of Financial Aid. Method of Application The following procedure should be followed by any student entering the University for the first time who wishes to apply for financial aid: 1. File an Application for Admission with the Office of Admission. No student will be considered for assistance until they are admitted to the University. 2. Submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA requires no fee and can be completed online at www.fafsa.ed.gov. All students should file the FAFSA before March 1 for priority consideration. (For Indiana residents, the FAFSA must be received by the federal processor by March 10 to be eligible for Indiana awards.) The filing of the FAFSA may be completed after October 1.  Renewal All need-based financial assistance requires the annual filing of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Students should file by March 1 for priority consideration. Renewal depends on continued need, the availability of funds, and eligibility as described below, including meeting the requirements for satisfactory academic progress. The policy can be found on page 429. Financial Aid Programs Financial aid awards may include gift aid (grants and scholarships) and/or self-help (loans and employment). Financial Aid Eligibility To be eligible for most federal, state, and Valparaiso University assistance, undergraduate students must be enrolled full-time (some federal and state assistance is available to part-time students) in a degree or certificate program with at least twelve credits per semester; maintain satisfactory academic progress; demonstrate financial need as determined by filing the FAFSA; be a U.S. citizen or an eligible noncitizen; not be in default on a federal loan or owe a refund or repayment on any federal or state program. Graduate students also must meet the above requirements. However, they must be enrolled in a degree program with at least four and one half credits per semester. Initial financial aid awards are based on the assumption that the recipient will be enrolled as a full-time student. Students who enroll for less than full time or who withdraw during a semester could have their financial aid award reduced or canceled. Enrollment status is determined at the beginning of each semester. For federal aid, enrollment status is determined when the aid is disbursed. Scholarships and Special Awards Valparaiso University makes available to new students a variety of scholarships and awards based on academic and other qualifications. Eligibility for all scholarships and awards is determined by the University Scholarship Committee whose decision is final. Scholarships and awards are offered in good faith by the University with the intent they will be renewed under the conditions specified. Specific renewal requirements for scholarships and awards are stated in the scholarship award letter sent to each recipient upon admission. Annual scholarships awarded for four years are to be evenly divided each year between fall and spring semesters. If a student recipient graduates after only seven semesters of enrollment, the eighth semester of the scholarship is no longer available. Some exceptions are possible for students who enroll in summer terms with the express purpose of graduating early. Students should contact the Financial Aid Office as soon as they begin to consider graduating in less than four years to review how their financial aid awards will be affected. If an award is not renewed because the cumulative grade point average falls below the standard, the award may be restored if the student's cumulative grade point average meets the standard at a later time. The student should contact the Financial Aid Office to request restoration of the award.  Financial Aid 426 The University does reserve the right to alter any scholarship or award should circumstances dictate. Some scholarships and awards may not be offered in combination with each other. Please refer to our website at valpo.edu/student-financial-services/planning for a list of scholarships and for more information. Need-Based Aid Grant Programs Valpo Fund Alumni Awards are institutional awards that are not repaid. All students who file the FAFSA will be considered. These scholarships are funded, in large part, by the endowed and donated scholarships listed on page 431. Federal Pell Grants are available to all students who have demonstrated financial need according to a federal formula. The FAFSA is required. Award amounts vary based on federal guidelines; may be enrolled full-time or part-time. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) are federal grants, awarded to Valparaiso University students with the greatest financial need with first preference to Federal Pell Grant recipients. Although by regulation the awards can range from $200 to $4,000, the actual awards determined by Valparaiso University are dependent upon the amount of funding provided by the federal government and the number of Pell Grant recipients. Recipients may be enrolled either full-time or part-time. State Grants (Freedom of Choice Award and 21st Century Award) are for eligible Indiana residents and may be used at Valparaiso University. Non-Indiana residents should contact their state agencies for information and application procedures for any state grants for which they may be eligible. The FAFSA must be received by the federal processor by March 10 to be eligible for Indiana Awards. Awards are based on need, and are determined annually by state formula. Students must be enrolled full-time for the standard grant programs. Loan Programs Need-based student loans feature subsidized interest and deferred payments. Students must be enrolled at least half-time. Repayment of these loans does not begin until six to nine months after graduation or after dropping below half-time status. Payments may be deferred for attending graduate school or for a variety of special circumstances. Repayments usually extend over a period of ten years although extended terms and income-based plans are also offered. There is no penalty in student loan programs for prepaying interest and principal. Many Valparaiso University students receive loans as part of their financial aid packages. In addition to the loans listed below, there are other private lenders who specialize in educational loans that are not based upon financial need. The following federal need-based educational loans are available through Valparaiso University. To be eligible, you must complete and submit the FAFSA. Valparaiso University notifies the student of eligibility via an Award Notification. Federal Direct Subsidized Student Loans Undergraduate students enrolled at least half-time who demonstrate financial need. Monies come from the federal government. The federal government pays interest while the borrower is in school. Repayment begins six (6) months after the borrower is no longer enrolled in college at least half-time. Students should complete and submit the FAFSA to apply, and all first-time borrowers must complete entrance counseling and sign a promissory note online at studentloans.gov. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loans These loans are available to students who are enrolled at least half-time and who are not eligible for or were partially eligible for the Federal Direct Subsidized Loan. Terms and limits are the same as Federal Direct Subsidized Loans, except the student is charged interest on the loan from the date funds are disbursed. Federal Direct Loan Limits • Freshmen = $5,500 ($3,500 max in a subsidized loan) • Sophomore = $6,500 ($4,500 max in a subsidized loan) • Junior = $7,500 ($5,500 max in a subsidized loan) • Senior = $7,500 ($5,500 max in a subsidized loan) For independent undergraduates, the loan limits are higher than the Federal Direct Loan maximums. Freshmen/sophomore independent students may receive up to $6,000 in additional unsubsidized loans and juniors/seniors up to $7,000 more per academic year. Federal Direct Parent Loans for Undergraduate Students (PLUS) These loans are for parents of dependent students enrolled in at least six semester hours. Monies come from the federal government. This loan is not based on financial need, but a credit check is required. Financial Aid 427 The loan limits are up to the cost of education, less other aid, per student. Repayment of the principal and interest may begin 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed or the parent may request deferred repayment. The filing of the FAFSA is required. Parents may apply for the Parent PLUS at studentloans.gov. Alternative Loans Available from a variety of private lenders. Principal and interest may be deferred while in school, and a co-signer is usually required. Valparaiso University Loans Limited, low interest loans are administered by Valparaiso University. The amounts vary. Contact the Office of Financial Aid for details.  The Garland Loan Fund Loans for students majoring in the sciences or mathematics. These will be non-interest bearing loans.  Garman Loan Fund A loan fund has been established by Benjamin L. Garman to help students who cannot qualify for a scholarship but who must have financial assistance or those with scholarships who need more help.  Nellie Winifred Cheney Overton Memorial Loan Fund This fund was established by Mr. William J. Overton as a memorial to Mrs. Overton. The income from the fund is available for loans to students from Lake County, Indiana.  Schell Loan This loan is funded by the Schell Foundation and is available to undergraduate students from select states.  Henry Strong Educational Foundation Provides loans to qualified full-time upper class students under thirty years of age.  Loan Repayment Terms Each of the loan programs contains specific repayment terms and conditions which are a part of the promissory note the student signs upon receipt of the loan fund. Students are responsible for being aware of the various loan provisions and thus should review the terms of the repayment obligation prior to accepting funds under these loan programs. Loan Repayment Information Sensible borrowing can not only help pay for college but also help establish a good credit history. Similarly, not making regular payments can result in a poor credit rating or even default status on student loans. To estimate future repayment obligations, go to studentloans.gov and use their repayment calculators. For example monthly payment on $20,000 in Direct Loans at 6.8% interest will be $230.16 per month for ten years. Federal Direct Loan borrowers will be notified by their loan servicer about repayment of loans. There are a variety of repayment options and options for deferring repayment. Alternative Sources of Aid The following sources are not based on financial need. Non-need based loans are limited to the cost of education less other financial aid, or the annual loan limits, whichever is less. Vocational Rehabilitation Under the provision of Public Law 565, the federal government and the State of Indiana jointly provide funds for scholarship grants-in-aid to students who have a physical or mental impairment which constitutes a vocational handicap. The State Vocational Rehabilitation Division is responsible for the determination of the grants.   Financial Aid 428 Veterans' Programs In addition to working with the Veterans' Administration (VA), military veterans should consult with the Financial Aid Office as soon as possible when preparing to enroll at Valparaiso University. The University does participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program under the Post 9/11 GI Bill, otherwise known as Chapter 33. The University awards the Patriot Award which in conjunction with the base Chapter 33 benefit and the additional Yellow Ribbon benefit will cover 100% of tuition and general fee for undergraduate students. Graduate and law students should refer to their schools' respective policies. The University does limit the number of Yellow Ribbon recipients it funds and priority goes to returning students already in the program and then on a first come, first-served basis for new students. Veterans are asked to meet with Financial Aid Office staff to discuss their options before enrolling. ROTC Programs Students who participate in the Air Force or Army ROTC programs may receive scholarship assistance through ROTC. Army or Air Force ROTC students who receive full tuition scholarships along with ROTC living and book stipends will also be guaranteed additional scholarships/grants from the University such that the total of all aid will equal at least the tuition, general fees, on campus room and meal plans appropriate for the students' academic grade levels, and books. Air Force ROTC students who receive partial tuition scholarships through ROTC will also receive University scholarship/grants at least in the amount of on campus room and meal plans appropriate for the students' academic grade levels. A student must live in University-owned or controlled housing and be enrolled in a full-time meal plan in order to receive the additional University funding. If University scholarships/grants are part of the ROTC student's award, then total resources including ROTC scholarships and stipends may not exceed the student's cost of attendance as determined by the Financial Aid Office. ROTC students may elect to decline University scholarship/grant aid in order to utilize federal student loan assistance which allows the students to receive aid in excess of the cost of attendance. ROTC students are asked to meet with Financial Aid Office staff to discuss their options before enrolling. Valparaiso University Lilly Community Award Indiana students selected by their local Lilly Community Foundation to receive its full tuition and fees scholarship will also be guaranteed University scholarship/grant aid such that the total of all aid will cover tuition, general fee, on-campus room and meal plan appropriate to the student’s grade level, and books. A student must live in University-owned or controlled housing and be enrolled in a full-time meal plan in order to receive the additional University funding. Campus Employment Students are employed in a variety of positions on campus. Open positions are posted on Valparaiso University's “Handshake” web site at valpo.joinhandshake.com/login. Students should contact the individual departments with job openings to apply for positions. Students with demonstrated financial need may work under the Federal Work Study Program (FWS). FWS students may also apply for off-campus jobs in the Community Service component of the program. Students may work on campus under the Valparaiso University Work Study Program regardless of financial need. Payment of Financial Aid Most aid is divided and credited to student accounts in equal amounts for each semester. Most aid is ready to disburse at the beginning of each semester, although the actual date that funds are disbursed varies and no aid can be disbursed until all requested documentation has been submitted to and reviewed by the Office of Financial Aid. Aid is credited regularly throughout the semester. Students must be enrolled for the sufficient number of credits (according to the requirements of each program) in a semester to receive financial aid. Students whose financial aid exceeds the University charges for the semester, may request a refund from the Office of Student Accounts. It is each student's responsibility to verify semester charges, financial aid credits, and refunds for accuracy. Students receive work-study awards as a direct deposit to their financial institution every two weeks for hours worked in the previous pay period, not as a credit on their student account. Financial aid for students who withdraw from Valparaiso University will be adjusted based on the University's refund policy. Specific information may be found in the Refund Policy section of this catalog (beginning on page 424). Off-Campus Study Students enrolled in an off-campus program, including study abroad programs, which are approved for credit by Valparaiso University, are eligible to apply for financial aid. University grants and scholarships are available only for selected Valparaiso University programs. Financial Aid 429 Exit Interviews Prior to graduation, leaves of absence, or withdrawal from the University, students who have accepted loans must complete separate interviews for Federal Direct Loans. Appeal Procedure A review of any decision concerning a financial aid package may be requested. First, contact the Office of Financial Aid. If the outcome of the initial review is unsatisfactory, then an appeal may be presented to the vice president for Enrollment Management. The decision of the vice president is final. Financial Aid Refund Policy If a student is due a refund under the Valparaiso University refund policy, and the student has received any financial aid other than Federal Work-Study, part of the refund must be returned to the sponsoring aid programs. The amount of refund is determined in accordance with the University refund policy listed in the catalog (see page 424). Policies for returning a portion of that refund to sponsoring aid programs are as follows. Valparaiso University Awards and Scholarships If a refund balance remains after funds have been returned to the federal programs, a prorated percentage of Valparaiso University funds will be refunded. Privately Funded Grants and Scholarships Some students will be recipients of funds from private donors such as churches, civic groups, foundations, etc. Many of these organizations will provide specific instructions concerning disbursement of their funds to students who withdraw. In the absence of specific instructions, the full scholarship will be applied to one semester. Funds on deposit with the University that the donor designated for future terms of enrollment within the academic year will be returned to the donor. Title IV Programs (Federal) Federal law determines the total amount of refund due, if any, when a student withdraws and how much of that refund must be returned to the federal programs. See page 424. State Grants and Scholarships Refunding proration is done according to specific regulations of the sponsoring state. Standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy Financial Aid recipients must maintain minimum standards of satisfactory academic progress for receipt of federal, state, and most Valparaiso University aid programs. All students receiving financial assistance must maintain an active status in a degree program. Regulations require a maximum time frame for degree completion, a quantitative measurement (credits earned toward a degree), and a qualitative measurement (cumulative grade point average). These three criteria are checked at the end of each academic year in May to determine whether students are maintaining satisfactory academic progress. Graduate and Law students should refer to the Graduate and Law Bulletins for specific policy requirements. Time Frame Measurement Students may attempt up to 150 percent of the hours required for a bachelor's degree. The 150 percent cap is the maximum limit according to federal regulations. The actual credit hour limit may vary depending on the requirements of each degree program. Most programs require 124 hours: for those programs the maximum attempted hours allowed is 186. Other programs, including music, engineering, nursing, and business degrees require more than 124 hours; therefore the maximum number of attempted hours allowed would be greater. All attempted hours at Valparaiso University, including regular semesters and summer sessions, as well as any credits transferred from other schools, will apply toward the 150 percent. Quantitative Measurement To comply with the 150 percent time frame requirement, students must complete at least two thirds (2/3) of all Valparaiso University hours attempted with a passing grade. At the end of each academic year, each student’s Valparaiso University total hours completed will be compared to the Valparaiso University total hours attempted to determine whether they are meeting this requirement.   Financial Aid 430 Qualitative Measurement Minimum cumulative grade point average standards are as follows: Freshmen (less than 24 hours completed) 1.650 Sophomores (24 to 55 hours completed) 1.750 Junior and above (56 or more hours completed) 2.000 Incompletes, Withdrawals, Repeated Courses, and Non-Credit Remedial Courses Incompletes and withdrawals will count as hours attempted but not completed. If incompletes are later completed, they will be reflected when progress is again checked, or sooner if the student appeals. Repeated courses will add to total hours attempted and hours completed. The new grade will be included in the grade point average calculation, which will be considered when progress is again checked, or sooner if the student appeals. Valparaiso University does not offer noncredit remedial courses. Appeals and Reinstatement Students whose academic progress is not in compliance with these standards will be notified in writing after the spring semester that their eligibility for aid has been terminated. They will also be advised of the appeal and reinstatement policy at that time. Students may appeal termination of their financial aid eligibility based on extenuating circumstances, which may include illness, death in the family, other circumstances beyond the student's control, or special academic circumstances. If the appeal is approved, the student will normally have one semester to attain grade point average and completed credit hour standards specified by the appeals committee. Students who do not appeal, or whose appeal is denied, will not regain financial aid eligibility until the semester after they have attained the appropriate grade point average and completed credit hour standards. The student should contact the Office of Financial Aid to initiate reinstatement. Appeals should be directed to the Office of Financial Aid Appeals Committee. Other Considerations Summer school credits may be considered in evaluating attainment of the academic progress standards on an appeal basis. Certain aid programs have shorter timeframe limits, and different grade point average requirements. Recipients of Valparaiso University Scholarships and other merit awards should refer to their scholarship award letter for the terms and conditions for renewal. In addition, federal loan programs have cumulative limits that may be reached before the maximum time-frame limits are reached. Student Financial Aid Responsibilities Students have the following responsibilities regarding financial aid assistance: 1. To pay special attention to their application for financial aid, complete it accurately, and submit it on time to the proper place. 2. To know and meet all deadline dates for applying or reapplying for aid. 3. To provide all documentation, corrections, and new information requested by the Office of Financial Aid or the agency to which the application is submitted. 4. To notify the institution of any information that has changed since first applying for financial aid. 5. To read, understand, and keep copies of all forms that they are asked to sign. 6. To repay student loans on a timely basis and keep the University informed of current address. 7. To attend any necessary interview sessions related to the loan. 8. To be aware of all published financial aid policies, understand them, and comply with these policies. Student Financial Aid Rights 1. To know what financial assistance is available, including information on all federal, state, and institutional financial aid programs. 2. To know the procedures and deadlines for submitting applications for each available financial aid program. 3. To know how the institution selects aid recipients. 4.

To know how the institution determines whether the student is making satisfactory progress and what happens if he or she is not. 7. To be fully informed of the terms and provisions of loan payments, including typical repayment schedules. 8.

Student Advisement First year engineering students are advised by the CoE Assistant Dean and the Engineering Academic Advisor for the first three semesters of their program. During the fourth semester, the student is assigned a faculty advisor from the department they are majoring in. This faculty advisor will help them prepare for their junior and senior years, as well as transition to graduate school or the workforce. Herman and Helen Hesse Learning Resource Center Staffed by a team of engineering peer tutors, the Hesse Learning Resource Center provides academic support and resources for all students taking classes included in the engineering program.

GEM 121,", the Hesse Center promotes student success through walk-in peer tutoring, course-specific help sessions, personalized tutoring schedules, and academic coaching for students in academic recovery. Senior Project All students in their senior year are required to complete a major design project. Students are organized into teams to plan, organize, execute, present, and document multidisciplinary design projects under the supervision of the faculty. Professional Licensure Licensure of those who wish to practice professional engineering is required by law in each of the states and the District of Columbia. The purpose of the law is to assure the general public that those professing to practice engineering have been examined and accepted by a State Board of Examiners. Graduate engineers will be able to more fully practice engineering if they are licensed as a Professional Engineer. Licensing requires passing the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination typically followed by four years of engineering experience, after which the candidate can sit for the Practice of Engineering (PE) Examination. Senior engineering students are provided with information about the licensing process and an invitation, which they are urged to accept, to take the FE Examination during their senior year. The FE exam is administered at an area testing center in an online environment. Student Professional and Service Organizations To heighten student interest in the profession of engineering and in activities of the College of Engineering student body, the college provides general interest programs for all engineering students and sponsors social and recreational activities. Upon selecting a major, students are encouraged to join the student chapter of the related professional society. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) all have active student chapters on campus. The College of Engineering supports other organizations of interest to its students. These include the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), a vibrant section of the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and a newly formed National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) student chapter. In alignment with the University's and College of Engineering's mission statements to develop servant leaders, the Engineers Without BordersTM (EWB) - Valparaiso Chapter was formed in the spring of 2002. In 2015, that organization has expanded to form Working Across Vocations Everywhere Through Service (WAVES), which includes EWB and other service-related activities. The students have also formed a University organization called Valpo Robotics. The goal of this organization is to design and build robots for various competitions. Junior and senior students who have distinguished themselves by high scholarship, exemplary character, unselfish activity, and breadth of interest in their profession may be elected to membership in Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society. Sophomore, junior, and senior students majoring in Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering who have distinguished themselves by high scholarship, character, and attitude may be elected to membership in Eta Kappa Nu, the national Electrical and Computer Engineering honor society. Placement The Career Center arranges on-campus interviews with a variety of employers who are interested in hiring our graduates. Comprehensive services are also available to assist students seeking employment opportunities with organizations which do not interview on campus. Assistance is also available within and outside the College of Engineering for students wishing to find graduate study opportunities, cooperative education positions, summer employment, or part-time employment during the school year. Resource libraries provide information on employment and graduate school opportunities throughout the United States. College of Engineering 319 Special Programs of the College of Engineering Cooperative Education The Cooperative Education Program provides an optional five-year program for personal and career development which integrates classroom theory with career-related work experience. Employment in a salaried position allows students to gain valuable experience, to test career interests and to apply classroom knowledge in an environment related to their professional degree areas. The cooperative education student acquires engineering experience through a planned and supervised program which provides alternating periods of full-time campus study and full-time off campus employment with co-op partners throughout the United States. The initial work assignment normally starts during the summer after the sophomore year. Academic credit is earned for each work period. Students typically complete four or five summer and semester work sessions with the same employer. The Cooperative Education Program enhances the graduating engineer’s placement status, and some employers count the time served as a cooperative education student toward benefits provided to full-time employees. To participate in the program, students’ cumulative GPA must be 2.400 or higher. Internships The Engineering Internship Program is an optional program in which all engineering students in good standing, except those participating in the Cooperative Education Program, may participate during their summer breaks. Participation is typically limited to the summer between the freshman and sophomore years through the summer between the junior and senior years. Academic year internships may be accommodated on a case-by-case basis. Students interested in this program can earn up to three credit hours of academic credit for their participation in the program. Interdisciplinary Studies Programs can be arranged to meet special needs or interests of students studying engineering at Valparaiso University. Students interested in career fields such as electromechanical, biomedical or chemical engineering, or medicine can enrich their engineering programs by careful selection of electives. These programs involve replacing technical, professional, and free electives with courses from other disciplines. Each student plans a program of study in consultation with a faculty advisor. Upon graduation, the student receives a Bachelor of Science degree in Civil, Computer, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering. Double Degree Program Some students wish to obtain a second engineering degree, a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree in the College of Arts and Sciences or the College of Business, in addition to their first degree in engineering. In general, this will require an additional year or more of study. To earn two degrees, students must earn at least 157 credit hours and attain a grade point average of at least 2.000, as well as complete all other graduation requirements for each degree independently. Please refer to the University policy regarding second degrees under the Academic Policies section on page 410. Engineering and Masters of Business Administration (MBA) Program. An engineering student interested in acquiring business, values-based leadership, and entrepreneurial acumen to augment their engineering skillset should consider pursuing the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree with an Engineering Management concentration. Through careful academic advising and proper selection of either a Business Administration minor or a Fundamentals of Business minor, an engineering student can complete the B.S. in Civil, Computer, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering and the MBA in five years. Interested students should speak with their academic advisor as early as possible when formulating their plan of study. Majors and Minors An engineering student may earn multiple majors or minors in other colleges of the University by satisfying catalog course and credit requirements for each major or minor. Each major or minor will require at least one course (of at least three credits) above any and all coursework presented for the engineering degree. The extra course cannot include any courses below the curricula requirements for an engineering degree. The use of engineering courses that are cross-listed or that have equivalent course content with courses required for the major or minor is established by official action of the other college. The major or minor will be noted on the student’s official academic record. Departmental Minors An engineering student seeking further breadth in their plan of study may earn one or more minors within the College of Engineering. The following minors are available: biomedical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering. See the requirements for each in their respective departmental listing.   College of Engineering 320 Engineering Minor The Engineering Minor offers non-engineering students an introduction to areas of engineering. This minor is especially appropriate for students with an interest in pursuing a career in an engineering related field. This minor would be of interest to science students who need an approved minor to graduate (see page 56). The College of Engineering assistant dean for student success will serve as the advisor. A minimum of 18 credit hours of engineering courses is required for this minor. Of these, at least 9 credits must be from 200-level or higher courses. "

Mission The mission of the Department of Civil Engineering is to provide the highest quality of technical education, which is grounded in the arts and sciences by faculty dedicated to exceptional teaching and extraordinary care for individual students. The department will strive to develop graduates who will be effective members of engineering teams, managers of engineering projects, and serve as leaders in the civil engineering discipline and within the broader community of church and society.   College of Engineering 325 Program Educational Objectives The Program Educational Objectives help to direct and measure the success of the Civil Engineering Department in accomplishing its mission. They are broad statements that describe what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation and are based on the needs of the program's constituencies. The Civil Engineering Program Education Objectives state that within five to ten years of graduation, civil engineering alumni will have: 1. Attained a position within the civil engineering community through which they are able to make a positive contribution to the engineering profession and society as a whole. 2. Participated in continuing education activities, such as courses taken for advanced degrees, seminars, workshops, and conferences, demonstrating their commitment to lifelong learning; and 3. Advanced in their profession. Advancement may be demonstrated through achievements such as promotions and licensure. “Civil engineering is the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and physical sciences gained by study, experience, and practice is applied with judgment to develop ways to utilize, economically, the materials and forces of nature for the progressive wellbeing of mankind in creating, improving, and protecting the environment, in providing facilities for community living, industry, transportation, and in providing structures for the use of mankind.” --American Society of Civil Engineers The Civil Engineering Program is designed to prepare the graduate to enter the practice of engineering or to pursue graduate study. The program is broad in scope requiring students to complete course work in five major branches of civil engineering (i.e., environmental, geotechnical, structural, transportation, and water resources engineering). Additional depth in one or several branches can be obtained through appropriate electives. The program emphasizes the importance of effective communication (e.g., written and oral); the ability to work in teams; the importance of ethical and professional responsibility; the need to be lifelong learners; and the need to hold paramount the safety, health, and welfare of the public. Design is an important component of the Civil Engineering Program. This includes distinguishing between analysis and design, exposing students to various design methodologies, and requiring students to develop and evaluate (i.e., using economic, social, safety, and engineering criteria) alternative solutions to realistic engineering problems. The design experience (i.e., individually and in teams) is spread throughout the program and is incorporated into both classroom and laboratory exercises. In the sophomore year, students are introduced to fundamental aspects of the design process in the mechanics of materials and their introductory courses in structural and transportation engineering. In the junior year, additional aspects of the design process and the use of standards, specifications, and building codes are discussed in courses in environmental engineering, water resources engineering, soil and foundation engineering, structural engineering, and transportation engineering. In the senior year, students apply their design skills in their civil engineering electives and capstone design experience. The capstone courses include a major, comprehensive design project in which students work in teams to bring together their accumulated knowledge of civil engineering to solve engineering problems with realistic constraints. Laboratory work is designed to develop written communication skills, ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, self-confidence, and to aid in the interpretation and application of classroom theory. The majority of introductory courses in the five branches of civil engineering require a laboratory component. The civil engineering department has modern, well-equipped laboratories in materials engineering, fluid mechanics, soil mechanics, and environmental engineering.

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers two degree programs: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. These two degrees share a fundamental theoretical background that is reflected by many common courses and shared laboratory facilities. In the sophomore year students take foundation courses in analog circuits, digital circuits, and programming. Computer-aided design tools and laboratories supplement the material taught in the classroom. During their junior year, students build on their foundation by studying electronics, linear systems, and embedded microcontrollers. Students also participate in group design projects and are introduced to a variety of realistic design constraints including engineering ethics, safety, and economics. The senior year is anchored by an interdisciplinary capstone project where students begin a systematic study of the design process and apply the knowledge acquired in earlier courses. Projects require the consideration of realistic constraints and standards, formal project management, the building and testing of a prototype, and thorough documentation. College of Engineering 331 The department supports a diverse set of laboratory facilities. The electronics laboratory supports work in digital and analog systems including power electronics. The digital systems laboratory is used for logic design, embedded microcontrollers and digital filtering systems.

Mechanical engineering contributes to almost every aspect of our society. The Mechanical Engineering Program prepares the individual for leadership roles on multidisciplinary teams that will address both technical and nontechnical issues. A curriculum solidly comprised of fundamental engineering course work and the humanities and social sciences is an essential element in the preparation process. Courses are sequenced to build upon a firm foundation in mathematics, basic sciences, and engineering sciences. Courses progressively involve students in engineering design activities and culminate in a major interdisciplinary design experience during the final year of study. Alongside technical issues, design activities address economic, safety, environmental, sustainability, product development, and social factors. Graduates of the Mechanical Engineering Program at Valparaiso University are qualified to enter industry as practicing engineers or to pursue advanced degrees. Mechanical Engineering Laboratories The Mechanical Engineering Program contains a significant laboratory component which is closely correlated with lecture courses. There are four primary laboratory facilities within the department, and these facilities are home to the eight different laboratory experiences within the program. Personal computers with appropriate hardware and software are available in the laboratories for mechanical design, to acquire and analyze data, to control hardware, and to report results in graphic and tabular form. Additional laboratory facilities support senior design projects and computational assignments. The Energy Systems Suite includes the Mechanical Measurements Laboratory, the Small Engines Laboratory, and the Engine Test Cell. This facility provides the opportunity to study the laws governing energy transformations due to energy transport as work and heat. The space also enables the students to learn the science of experimental methods by working with state-of-the-art measurement equipment, calibration techniques, and computer data acquisition. This facility includes laboratory equipment such as an internal combustion engine, a gas turbine, a supersonic nozzle, a solar collector, a heat pump, and a wind tunnel. The Manufacturing Processes and Systems Laboratory supports instruction in methods and theory of metal working, automation, product design and development, and the design, operation, and control of production systems. In addition to metal cutting, forming, welding, grinding and inspection equipment, this laboratory contains Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools. The Materials Science Laboratory contains equipment for conducting a variety of materials experiments including impact, tension, creep, cold working, hardness, and nondestructive testing. Special emphasis is placed upon modification of material properties by heat treatment. Metallurgical specimens are prepared and examined. The Analog Circuits, Automatic Control, and Vibrations Laboratory supports instruction in the study of mechanical and electrical systems. For example, the facility is used to control experiments with simulated process systems and the associated instrumentation to control these processes.

Military Leadership - Army Valparaiso University has an enrollment agreement with the University of Notre Dame enabling Valparaiso University students to participate in their Army ROTC program. As one of the premier Army ROTC programs in the country, the mission is to educate, train, develop, and inspire participants to become officers and leaders of character for the U.S. Army and the nation. The program does this through a combination of classroom instruction, leadership labs, and experiential learning opportunities focused on developing the mind, body, and spirit of participants. These opportunities are designed specifically to enhance character and leadership ability in the students/cadets and to allow them to practice the essential components of leadership: influencing, acting, and improving. Participants become members of the Fightin' Irish Cadet Battalion and complete a planned and managed sequence of classroom courses and practical exercises intended to develop each participant into what an officer must be – a leader of character, a leader with presence, and a leader of intelligence – to enable them to reach their full potential as an individual and as an effective leader of groups. The program affords students an excellent opportunity to serve and focuses on the role of Army officers in the preservation of peace and national security, with particular emphasis placed on ethical conduct and the officer's responsibility to society to lead, develop themselves and others, and achieve success. The experience culminates ideally with participants earning commissions as Second Lieutenants in the Active Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard. As an organization committed to lifelong learning, participants may elect to pursue one of the Army's numerous opportunities for follow-on postgraduate study as well. Course numbers ending in an odd number are taught during the fall semester; course numbers ending in an even number are taught during the spring semester.

Dean Jennifer Ziegler, Ph.D.  A program of graduate studies was initiated by Valparaiso University in 1963 to serve a variety of educational needs, including those of Northwest Indiana and the Great Lakes region. Today, through the Graduate School, Valparaiso University offers graduate degrees and certificates in programs in nine departments in the College Arts and Sciences, as well as in the College of Nursing and Health Professions, and the College of Business. A number of degrees may be earned in conjunction with the J.D. degree from the Valparaiso University Law School. With an emphasis on professional master’s degree programs including accredited programs leading to licensure, Valpo graduate programs emphasize career and professional development and prepare graduates to lead and serve in a global society. Although most graduate students attend full time, a significant number attend the University while holding full- or part-time employment. Select graduate programs draw strong interest from international applicants such that international students comprise over a third of graduate students at Valpo; and, Valpo graduate alumni hail from over 40 countries. Current initiatives include strengthening pathways that integrate undergraduate and graduate programs, and expanding into online formats. Details about all of the graduate programs and opportunities may be found in the Graduate Catalog, which can be found online. Contact the Graduate School, Valparaiso University by phone (219.464.5313) or visit their website valpo.edu/grad for more information. The graduate programs are under the general supervision of the provost and the faculty of the University. Its policies are defined by the Graduate Educational Policy Committee and are administered by the dean of the Graduate School.  391 Law School Visit the Law School online.  Interim Dean David R. Cleveland, J.D.  Associate Dean of Law Library and Information Services Steven Probst, J.D., MLS Assistant Dean for Students Stacey Turmel, J.D. Professors Blomquist, Brown, Cichowski, Cleveland, Herzig, Huss, Straubel, Telman, Trujillo, Welter; Associate Professors Ahmedkutty, Bushbaum, Carter, Denslaw, Heeren, D. Howard, Kass, Lesniewski, Wilks. In the late 1870s, Valparaiso attorney and Civil War Colonel Mark L. DeMotte decided that the importance of formalized legal education warranted a new department for the study of law at the local college. Convincing the college president that such training was crucial to the quality of legal representation throughout the country, Colonel DeMotte founded in 1879 a program for legal study that would become the Valparaiso University Law School. From the beginning, the Law School graduated new lawyers able to effectively practice law as soon as they joined the bar. This remains true today. By immersing its students in a rigorous program, Valparaiso Law School produces graduates that are successful, respected, and prepared. The Law School provides a range of course offerings recognized for its breadth, depth, and blend of legal theory and practice. The required curriculum provides a comprehensive and intensive study in the foundations of law, and a wealth of elective courses covering many substantive areas. Clinical programs, externships, and co-curricular organizations introduce students to advanced study in various areas of law and offer meaningful opportunities for innovation and specialization. By limiting enrollment, the school provides a learning environment where the rigors of legal education can be experienced with the help of careful guidance and support by the extraordinarily accessible faculty. From the classroom to the courtroom to the boardroom, our graduates thrive on the ongoing support of faculty, staff, students, and alumni. Continuously accredited by the American Bar Association since 1929, and the Association of American Law Schools since 1930, the School offers both the Juris Doctor (JD) and Masters in Law (LLM) degrees; and dual degrees, JD/MA in Psychology, JD/MBA, and JD/MS in Sports Administration. The JD degree options include the traditional three-year, full-time program; a part-time, five-year program; and an accelerated two-and-one-half- year program. The Law School also offers and invitation-only Honors Program, designed to offer a special academic challenge to highly talented students. The LLM degree is offered through a one-year, full-time program. This particular program is designed primarily for international lawyers who have a law degree from their home country and wish to enhance their understanding of the American legal system. The dual degrees are four-year programs. Admission to a dual degree program requires separate applications to both the Law School and Graduate School. Detailed program information about the Law School is available from the Law School (1.888.VALPOLAW, or valpo.edu/law).  392 Summer Sessions The University offers one twelve-week and two six-week sessions. Although most courses are six weeks, within each six-week term usually a number of specialized courses are offered in shorter periods of time. These sessions are an integral part of the year-round program of course offerings for both graduate and undergraduate students. They are specifically designed to serve a variety of publics: traditional Valparaiso University students accelerating their study, in-service teachers desiring further professional education, visiting students from other colleges earning credit while on summer vacation, junior and senior high school students beginning their college careers early, and other interested persons who would like to take coursework toward degree objectives or simply for personal enrichment. Undergraduate students may earn a maximum of seven credit hours in each six-week term, or 14 for the entire summer, which is nearly the equivalent of one semester's work. Graduate students may earn a maximum of six credit hours in each six-week term, or 12 for the entire summer. Courses on the undergraduate and graduate levels are offered in each session in virtually all areas of the College of Arts and Sciences, together with selected undergraduate and graduate courses in the College of Business, the College of Engineering, and the College of Nursing. Students in Arts and Sciences, Nursing, and Engineering may complete most of the coursework for the Fundamentals of Business Minor through one summer of intensive academic coursework. Each summer session features a variety of courses in the morning and evening to accommodate the student who wishes to take course work while employed full- or part-time. A selection of online courses offers maximum flexibility in scheduling and permits students to take coursework with minimal residency on campus. Also offered in the summer for academic credit are several one-week workshops and other abbreviated format courses. Educational tours, both domestic and international, are regularly offered during the summer. Information regarding tours is normally included in the Summer Session schedule, as well as in special descriptive brochures. Valparaiso University features the three-year baccalaureate program which offers students in selected programs the opportunity to complete their degree in three years by careful planning and the utilization of summer sessions. To complete their program as planned, students must apply for participation in the spring of their freshman year to make certain that they have the proper advising. Students should contact their academic advisor or the Office of the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for more information.

The College of Adult Scholars is a special program for highly motivated nontraditional (adult) students starting or returning to college to seek their first degree, or returning to college for further professional training by seeking a second degree or certificate of specialization. The college has its own mission, students, and tuition structure, and although the admission criteria are intended to recognize the special needs and experiences of adult learners, admission to the college is selective. Students in the college may select from all the majors and programs as full-time students, and they may take courses in the evening, daytime, or both. To qualify for the special tuition rate, a student's credit load may not exceed eleven hours during the spring and fall semesters. Admission and Registration Application to the College of Adult Scholars is made through the Office of the Graduate School and Continuing Education. Students who meet any one of the following four criteria are eligible to apply for admission: 24 years or older; have interrupted their formal education for more than three years; have a baccalaureate degree; or plan to take a Valparaiso University course approved and offered by the college at an offsite location or to a special population. Applicants who have completed an undergraduate degree or significant prior college coursework (minimum of 30 credits) with a grade point average of 2.000 or higher may be admitted unconditionally. Applicants not meeting these criteria but who show ability and promise for success may be admitted on a conditional basis. ACT/SAT scores are not required.
