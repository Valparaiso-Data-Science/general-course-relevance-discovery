COLLEGE OF DISTINCTIONVision StatementAn Alma College education seeks to instill a love of learning and celebrate the joy of discovery. Each Alma student will experience a deeply interdisciplinary education that provides opportunity for self-reflection, hands-on learning, and personal and professional development. It will embrace the principle of local, national and global learning communities, build upon strong mentoring relationships, and integrate rapidly changing technology essential for current and future career paths.The Core ValuesStudent-centered education in a residential settingAll members of the community — faculty, staff and trustees — are committed to creating an institution of quality centered on the growth and development of undergraduate students. The purpose of the residential college experience is to better prepare students to enter seamlessly into lives in community, vocation, family and faith.Disciplinary expertise within an interdisciplinary context of learningThe Alma Experience expects students to apply intellectual rigor to the exploration of a range of disciplines, building a broad foundation in the sciences, humanities, fine and performing arts and social sciences. This liberal arts education also prepares students to pursue advanced work, independent research and creative performances with the depth of understanding to excel in one’s discipline and to perceive the connections among disciplines. The practical knowledge and skills of the liberal arts prepare students for lifelong learning and leadership within a wide array of settings.Engaged learningBecause education takes place everywhere and all the time, it is important both to create an exciting residential learning environment and to extend opportunities for significant learning into the community and wider world. Active participation in learning, engaged citizenship, service-driven leadership and committed stewardship are fostered through research-based undergraduate scholarship as well as programs that support experiential, international and service-learning opportunities.Ethical integrity, aesthetic appreciation, spiritual sensitivityWith knowledge comes obligation. To live a complete life that withstands the scrutiny of self and others, individuals must exhibit personal integrity, respect for the value of all humanity and sensitivity to the spiritual and material beauty of one’s existence. We expect these prin-ciples to be modeled in the educational programs, work and daily interactions of all members of the college community.A College of DistinctionThe Alma College MissionAlma College’s mission is to prepare graduates who think critically, serve generously,  lead purposefully and live responsibly as stewards of the world  they bequeath to future generations.3WELCOME; ALMA COLLEGE IN BRIEFThe Alma College Catalog for 2018-2019 provides details on all of the College’s academic programs, policies, and procedures.

Whether you are deciding on a major, planning your Venture, seeking an internship, engaging in service learning, exploring summer research opportunities, or preparing to study abroad, we are here to help. At Alma you’ll find a faculty, staff and administration committed to helping you plan your own Alma experience for an engaged and rewarding academic career on campus and beyond.Welcome to Alma!— Kathleen Poorman Dougherty, Ph.D.Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic AffairsWelcome to Alma CollegeAlma College in BriefA Liberal Arts EducationMore than 130 years ago, a group of devoted Presbyterian clergy and laymen had a dream: to establish a liberal arts college based upon the loftiest of ideals — unifying the human mind and spirit through knowledge.The essence of a liberal arts education is learning how to learn. Once acquired, this skill can be applied to any task, any profession. Career success is determined by our abilities to exercise such skill. The college’s membership in Phi Beta Kappa is an indication of excellence in the liberal arts. Only 10 percent of colleges and universities share this distinction.A liberal arts education holds up a mirror to the world around us, and in its reflection we see ourselves: as we were, as we are, as we might be. Through such self-discovery comes inspiration and, from inspiration, lifelong commitment. The highest moral and ethical character is built upon such foundations. Our best leaders are shaped by such beliefs.Academic Programs and DegreesAlma is classified as a selective Baccalaureate College — Arts and Sciences by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The College confers bachelor’s degrees in five areas: arts, sciences, fine arts, music and nursing.Religious AffiliationAlma College, affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), affirms its Christian heritage in which all people are made in the image of God. We seek to foster a diverse community by welcoming people of all faiths, as well as those with no faith tradition, into the Alma College experience. Founded by Presbyterians in 1886, Alma is a highly regarded four-year liberal arts college. Though it is church affiliated, the college does not make religious affiliation or doctrinal uniformity a condition for admission or employment. Our heritage af-firms that faith and critical thinking reinforce each other. We are committed to cultivating intellectual, spiritual, and vocational discovery in all aspects of campus life.Scholarship and Assistance OpportunitiesTo recognize students’ academic achievements in high school, Alma College administers a strong pro-gram of scholarships. Regardless of financial need, Alma students can receive scholarship support based on outstanding academic achievements.Also available are State of Michigan scholarships, grants and loans; federal grants and loans; and federal and College work study program funding.Undergraduate ResearchAlma students are often invited to team up with faculty on scholarly research or to collaborate on creative or performing arts projects. An annual Honors Day features student presentations, performances and exhib-its. Many students also present such work at regional, national and international meetings.4ACCREDITATION AND COMPLIANCE STATEMENTSAlma College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commis-sion.

Alma’s academic catalog contains the most accurate infor-mation available at the time of publication. Alma College reserves the right to change without notice, statements in this catalog con-cerning, but not limited to, curricula, fees, rules, policies, scholar-ships and tuitions.5ACADEMIC RULES AND PROCEDURESAcademic Rules and ProceduresAcademic Advising ProgramUpon admission to Alma College, each student is assigned a faculty advisor on the basis of academic and career interests. Working with this advisor, students plan their courses and evalu-ate their progress. For those students who are uncertain about their interests, advisors are specially selected who can assist them in exploring and establishing a career direction through a well-developed plan of coursework and co-curricular experiences. Students’ academic goals may also change during the course of their college careers. Accordingly, students may change advisors at any time, especially when an academic major is declared.Conditions of EnrollmentRegistration. Returning students usually select courses dur-ing the registration period in the preceding term. Newly admitted students make course selections during Becoming A Scot Days. The selections are then reviewed with their faculty advisors during Orientation week, at which time the schedule may be adjusted.Changes in Registration. Students must file changes through the approval process with the Registrar’s Office. Courses may be added during the first week of each term if approved by the advisor and during the second week if approved by both the advisor and the instructor. No courses, except for those scheduled for the last seven weeks of the term, may be added after the second week.Withdrawal. Withdrawal from an individual class may occur through the ninth week of a 14-week course, the fifth week of a seven-week course, or the third week of a four-week course. Neither the course nor the withdrawal will appear on the student’s record. Please refer to the Alma College Academic Calendar for specific course add and drop dates.Class Load. The class load for a 14-week term shall be no less than 13 and no more than 18 credits for full-time status. Students who wish to qualify for full benefits from the Veterans Administra-tion, Social Security or other financial aid sources are advised to enroll for not less than 13 credits. Athletes should be aware that the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association requires a 13-credit load for eligibility.Class Attendance Requirements. Class attendance require-ments are set by each individual instructor. Among the options available is mandatory attendance, with absences resulting in a lower grade. Faculty members who do not implement a mandatory attendance policy will take measures to combat a common student misconception — that if attendance is not required (with penalties attached), it is not important. To this end, the syllabi for all classes will explicitly state the attendance policy.Commencement Attendance. Seniors are required to participate in Commencement unless excused by the Provost or the Registrar.Final Examination Schedule. The Final Examination Schedule is established by the Registrar and published at the beginning of each term. Instructors will announce testing plans in the course syllabus; the final test or activity (presentation, paper, etc.) must be at the officially-scheduled time. Make-up examinations are given only with the permission of the instructor and may be charged a fee.Withdrawal from College. Students who wish to withdraw from Alma College must complete the withdrawal process by contacting the Center for Student Opportunity. If this process is not com-pleted, students will forfeit their deposits and refunds. The College assumes that students beginning a term intend to complete it. Stu-dents who leave during a term without completing the withdrawal process may receive failing grades for course enrollments.Service members who must withdraw during the term due to unanticipated deployments or mobilization, activation, and/or tempo-rary duty assignments may have the option to complete the term off campus, if feasible. The student would need to consult with faculty members and the Registrar’s Office to review the options available.If completion of the term is not an option, students withdraw-ing would be assigned non-punitive grades of “W” (for “withdraw”) for the term.Grading PracticesGrading System. The following letters and grade points are used to record evaluations of student work: “A” (4.0); “AB” (3.5); “B” (3.0); “BC” (2.5); “C” (2.0); “CD” (1.5); “D” (1.0); “DE” (0.5); and “E” (0.0 — failing). An “E” will be recorded for such reasons (other than failure to meet course requirements) as dishonesty, excessive absence or failure to comply with other conditions specified by the instructor.Incomplete Grades. Incomplete (“IN”) grades must be replaced by letter grades within six weeks after the end of the term or they automatically convert to “E.”Work in Progress. Work in Progress (“IP”) must be successfully completed and graded within one year of the date of enrollment, or the grade automatically converts to “E” unless the instructor initiates Withdrawal Pass (“WP”) or Withdrawal Fail (“WF”). Work in Progress grades may be used only for independent study or practicum courses. A grade of “Z” is assigned by the Registrar when a grade has not been received from an instructor.Satisfactory Grade Option. Students may elect the Satisfac-tory Grade Option (“S” or “F”) by filing the approved form with the instructor’s consent at the Registrar’s Office before the deadline to drop the class. If the student elects this option, evaluation of the course work is recorded as “S” (equivalent to a “C” or better) or as “F” (failing, no credit). Neither grade is computed in the GPA.Application of the “S/F” option is limited as described below:1. It is available only to students of sophomore, junior or senior standing.2. No more than 16 credits may apply to the 136-156 required for the degree.3. No more than six credits per term may be elected under this option.4. No course counting for a Teaching Major or Minor and no education course presented for teacher certification may be graded using this option.5. No more than four credits of the 36 required for the major (or six credits of the 56 required for an interdepartmental major or POE) may be graded under this option.Some classes are graded only “S” or “F” and the student has no option. Credits earned for these courses are not subject to the limitations described above.Grade Reports. Grade Reports are made available to all students on the student portal at the end of each term and to first-year students and sophomores at mid-term.Appeal of Grades. Appeal of grades may be made when the student has evidence that the final grade is unfair, but the appeal must be made not later than six months after the recording of the initial grade. The appeal proceeds first to the instructor, then to the department chair, and, if the disagreement still stands, it may go to the Provost.Academic ProgressClassification of Students. Students admitted to Alma College may earn degree credits. If enrolled in a full class load, students will be certified as regularly enrolled students and classification will be based on the number of credits earned: freshman (0-24); sophomore (25-55); junior (56-89); or senior (90 plus). Eligibility for some forms of financial aid may depend upon progress toward the degree as indicated by these classifications.6ACADEMIC RULES AND PROCEDURESProbation and Dismissal. Students must achieve a 2.0 GPA to graduate. Students with less than a 2.0 GPA will be placed on pro-bation and may be dismissed or barred from registration whenever such action is considered to be in the best interest of the student or the College.Probation Guidelines. The Probation Guidelines in the chart below are based on an ascending scale of grade point deficien-cies and the number of terms enrolled in college. Normal progress is defined as any condition above unsatisfactory progress (i.e., jeopardy).Only students who are making unsatisfactory progress will be subject to restrictions on athletic eligibility, extracurricular activities and/or financial aid eligibility. Students will qualify for the recom-mended status when either the GPA equals or falls below, or the grade point deficiency equals or exceeds, the posted criteria.Probation Guidelines Unsatisfactory Progress Satisfactory Progress# Terms Dismissal Jeopardy Probation Warning1  — 1.25 (-12) 1.75 (-4) <2.00 (-0.5)2  1.50 (-16) 1.70 (-10) <2.00 (-0.5)3  1.70 (-14) 1.85 (-8) <2.00 (-0.5)4  1.80 (-12) 1.90 (-6) <2.00 (-0.5)5  1.90 (-10) 1.95 (-4) <2.00 (-0.5)6  1.95 (-6) <2.00 (-0.5)7-10 <2.00 (-0.5)Academic Dismissal. Academic dismissal constitutes involun-tary separation of the student from the College for a minimum of one Fall or Winter term. Re-enrollment, on academic jeopardy, is contingent upon approval of the Academic Standards Commit-tee. Approval typically will be granted upon evidence of improved performance in academic work as demonstrated by success-ful (cumulative 3.0 or higher) completion of the equivalent of 13 credits of coursework which meets the requirements for transfer credits. In no case will a student be readmitted for the regular term succeeding the term in which the student was dismissed. First-term freshmen and first-term transfer students are not subject to academic dismissal.Academic Jeopardy. Academic Jeopardy represents “unsatisfac-tory progress toward the degree” for determining eligibility for such programs as intercollegiate athletics and financial aid. Unsatisfac-tory progress also results from failure to complete credits accord-ing to this schedule: first year — 25; second year — 56; third year — 90; fourth year — 110; and fifth year — 136. Students who are subject to this level of probation may re-enroll at Alma College in a subsequent term according to the conditions as follows:1. Arrangement with the academic advisor of a plan for improving academic performance to include repetition of classes, change of academic program, participation in the academic enrichment program, weekly meetings with the advisor to monitor progress and/or reduction of course load.2. Agreement to the restriction of participation in extracurricular activities including varsity athletics, Greek societies, community government and/or hours of employment.3. Completion of an interview with an administrator in the Center for Student Opportunity to verify understanding of and compli-ance with these conditions prior to re-enrollment.First-term transfer students will qualify for jeopardy status ac-cording to the criteria for first-term freshmen. After the first term of enrollment at Alma, however, the published guidelines will apply.Academic Probation and Warning. Academic Probation and Warning are categories of probation which should warrant the student’s concern, but are not subject to the extracurricular restrictions cited above. Eligibility for some forms of financial aid, however, may be affected.Right of Appeal. Individuals or groups affected directly by com-mittee actions or decisions have the right to appeal such actions or decisions by submitting dissenting reports first to the com-mittee, and second to the Faculty Organization and/or Student Congress (except in those cases where appeal procedures are delineated in the description of committee functions.)Notification of these actions will be sent from the Office of the Provost to the student after review by the Academic Standards Committee of the faculty.In accordance with Veterans Administration regulations, students who receive VA benefits and remain on probation for two consecutive terms will be deemed ineligible for further VA certification. To qualify again for VA benefits, such students must achieve a 2.0 GPA.Other ProceduresAcademic Minors. Students may obtain a minor in some fields of study. The minor must be a concentration of at least 24 cred-its including the requirements listed by the department. Every 24-credit concentration does not constitute a minor; to qualify, it must be approved by the department on a minor declaration form available at the Registrar’s Office.The GPA in the area of the minor concentration must be at least 2.0 (“C”).Repetition of Coursework. Repetition of coursework is permit-ted. In each case, the most recent effort is counted. Each effort is recorded on the student’s permanent record. Students may repeat a course that they passed previously to try to improve the original grade; however, no additional credits will be earned for the repeat.Waiver Petitions. To secure waiver of College policies or require-ments, students may petition the Academic Standards Commit-tee. Comments from the advisor and other concerned parties are often required before the petition will be reviewed. There is no charge for the petition process. Petition forms are available in the Registrar’s Office.Academic Dishonesty. Appropriate disciplinary action, including possible separation from the College, will be taken when students engage in plagiarism; the exchange of information on examinations; assisting or receiving assistance in the completion of an exami-nation, the writing of an essay or the preparation of a laboratory report; or any other attempt to obtain deceptively an unearned grade.Disciplinary Procedures. Disciplinary action following academic dishonesty is handled initially by the faculty member in whose class the offense occurred, who may impose penalties up to and includ-ing failure in the course. (Note: A student may not drop a course in which he or she has been failed for cheating.) All infractions and actions are to be reported to, and recorded in, the Provost’s Office. These cases are then reviewed by the Provost, who, especially in the case of repeated offenses, may apply more severe penalties than those imposed by the instructor. Finally, the Provost may refer cases to the Campus Judicial Committee, which may impose penal-ties up to and including suspension or expulsion from the College.Appeals Procedures. A student may appeal the instructor’s decision to the Provost. The student may appeal the Provost’s decision to the Campus Judicial Committee.7ACADEMIC HONORS; SPECIAL PROGRAMSDean’s ListStudents who achieve a 3.5 term GPA while carrying a mini-mum load of 13 credits (eight of which must be graded A-E) qualify for the Dean’s List. The Dean’s List is compiled at the end of both the Fall and Winter terms.Departmental HonorsTo graduate with Departmental Honors, students must demon-strate superior performance on the departmental comprehensive evaluation (where offered), present a thesis of honors caliber and achieve a GPA of at least 3.5 in the major field. Each department has autonomy over the comprehensive evaluation and the thesis.President’s Outstanding Senior AwardThe President of Alma College may select seniors who have com-pleted seven full (Fall or Winter) terms at Alma College and demon-strated scholastic superiority to receive the President’s Outstanding Senior Award.Academic HonorsPresidential Honors ProgramIn addition to academic excellence and a more thorough under-standing of the liberal arts, the Presidential Honors Program’s pri-mary goals include stewardship, citizenship and leadership. Honors scholars are encouraged to immerse themselves in campus and community service and act as role models for their student peers.Freshman Year. Honors students enroll in a one-semester 2-credit First Year Honors course, usually in the winter term. During this seminar, you will learn the history and rationale of the liberal arts and begin to consider how the liberal arts can best serve the needs of a 21st century student.

Exchange Programs — defined as programs with institutions or organizations that have a reciprocal exchange agreement with Alma College to both send and receive students. Students are assessed Alma College tuition and mandatory fees for semester programs. Tuition for summer programs and all room and board fees are assessed for either Alma College or the host institution, depending on the College’s agreement with the host institution. Alma College, state and federal financial aid may be applied toward semester exchange programs.2.

All students except those who have declared a World Languages and Cultures major requiring study abroad are assessed the tuition and mandatory fees of the selected host program. External funding, including state and federal financial aid, may be applied to off-campus study. Alma College financial aid, including Tuition Exchange Programs, is generally not applied toward study abroad and domestic off-campus study programs. Employee Tuition Grants (ETG) may be applied to off-campus study up to the cost of Alma College tuition.b. Students who have declared a World Languages and Cul-tures major that requires study abroad may choose either of the following:i. Students may be assessed Alma College tuition and receive all Alma College and state and federal financial aid during their study abroad in the fall, winter or spring terms. No financial aid is available for summer programs. If the host institution’s tuition cost exceeds the cost of Alma College tuition, the student is charged for the ex-cess amount in addition to the cost of Alma’s tuition.or:ii. Students may be assessed the host institution tuition and receive only state and federal financial aid for semester programs. No financial aid is available for summer programs. ETG may be applied up to the cost of Alma College tuition. Unused ETG may occasionally be used in a subsequent semester.Orientation. All new incoming students are required to attend Orientation before the Fall Term. Transfer students are strongly encouraged to attend Orientation. The charge for Orientation is $350 and includes room and board.Student Activity Fee. The students of Alma College have elected to assess a fee on themselves at the rate of $260 per year.

Payments can also be made online with a Visa, Mastercard, American Express or Dis-cover card, or with an e-check at the Financial Services Office Web site: www.alma.edu/paymybill. A 2.5% convenience fee is charged for all credit and debit card payments. There is no fee to make an electronic check payment.If the amount of the payment is more than the amount due, students may request a refund or the amount will be credited to their account.Advance billings are available to be viewed and/or downloaded from the student portal approximately one month before the start of each term. Payment may be made by mail, online or in person at the Alma College Financial Services Office.Payment must be received by the College prior to registration, or the student will have to make payment at the Financial Services Office during registration. Students are not permitted to attend class without making satisfactory financial arrangements.12COLLEGE EXPENSESAccount Holds. A student’s account is placed on a financial hold for the following reasons:1. The student has withdrawn or graduated and has not paid their account balance in full. Until the account balance is paid in full, a student’s transcript and/or diploma cannot be released.2. The student is an active, current student with an account balance of $1,000 or higher. An active, current student is not able to register or be placed in (or retain) a housing assignment for a future term until the account is under $1,000. Default of the repayment plan may result in loss of the student’s registration and housing assignment.Late Payment Fees. Tuition and fees are due before classes start for each term. A late payment fee of $25 per month is assessed on student accounts with a past due balance.Failure to Meet Financial Obligations. In accordance with stan-dard practice at colleges and universities, students are required to make satisfactory arrangements with the Financial Services Office for the settlement of all financial obligations. These include student accounts, student loans, parking fines, library fines, music record rentals and other expenses.When a student fails to meet financial obligations, Alma College reserves the right to withhold the issuance of grades, transcripts and diplomas, and to suspend a student until the obligations are met. Unpaid balances on inactive student accounts will be referred to a collection agency. The student has responsibility for all costs and fees associated with the collection of the debt.Financial Aid. Any financial aid other than a work-study grant awarded by the College for the entire year will be prorated; 50% to be available Fall Term and 50% to be available Winter Term. A work-study grant may not be deducted from charges because this aid represents funds to be earned during the year. Scholarships and grants awarded by organizations other than Alma College will not be credited until actually received. The Director of Financial Aid must be notified of any scholarship or grant awarded by organiza-tions and agencies other than Alma College. You may review all financial aid policies at https://www.alma.edu/admissions/financial-aid/policies/ as it is your responsibility to be familiar with situations that may affect your financial aid.Refund of Federal Title IV Financial Aid. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 mandates the formula for calculating the amount of financial aid a student and school may retain when a student withdraws from all classes before completing 60% of the term. Under Title IV financial aid regulations, the withdrawal date is defined as the earlier of:1. The date the student began the withdrawal process or officially notified the institution of the intent to withdraw, or2. The student’s last date of documented attendance at an academically-related activity. If a student stops attending and fails to officially withdraw from classes, the student is consid-ered to be unofficially withdrawn.Unofficial withdrawal dates are determined by an end-of-term report from the Registrar’s Office to identify students who have no passing grades. Faculty are contacted to determine the last date of attendance or academic activity for a student and that date is used as the withdrawal date.If there is no proof of attendance beyond 60% completion of the term, the student is considered unofficially withdrawn and a refund calculation is performed.Section 484B (c) of the HEA states that it is the institution’s respon-sibility to determine a student’s withdrawal date. Therefore, the insti-tution, not the student, must document a student’s attendance at an academically related activity. A student’s certification of attendance that is not supported by documentation by the institution would not be acceptable documentation of the student’s attendance.The percentage of Title IV assistance earned is determined by dividing the total number of calendar days in the semester into the number of calendar days completed as of the withdrawal date. Any unearned aid must be returned to the Title IV program(s). Funds are returned in the following order: Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Subsidized Stafford Loan, Perkins Loan, PLUS Loan, Pell Grant, SEOG and other Title IV programs. The student must either repay the federal overpayment in full or make satisfactory arrangements with either the Alma College Financial Services Office or the federal Department of Education. The payment or arrangement for pay-ment must be made within 45 days of the date of notification of the federal overpayment or the student will lose further eligibility of federal Title IV aid until the debt is paid in full. Withdrawal from College Refund Policy. Tuition and the student activity fee are refunded according to the following table.Refunds for Fall and Winter Terms Withdrawal During Percentage of  Calendar Week No. Tuition Refundable 1 90% 2 85% 3 80% 4 70% 5 65% 6 60% 7 50% 8 45% 9 40% 10 and after No RefundCollege scholarships, grants and/or loans received by the stu-dent will be refunded on a comparable percentage basis.Refunds for other non-College financial aid will be made in accor-dance with the rules and regulations applicable to those programs.Withdrawal from College. Students who wish to withdraw from Alma College must complete the withdrawal process by contacting the Center for Student Opportunity. If this process is not completed, students will forfeit their deposits and refunds. The College assumes that students beginning a term intend to complete it. Students who leave during a term without completing the withdrawal process may receive failing grades for course enrollments and will be respon-sible for any tuition, and room and board charges for the term. If a student has registered for a future term and decides not to attend that term, the student must contact the CSO to formally withdraw and be removed from those classes. Failure to do so will result in the student being responsible to pay for tuition, fees, and room and board for the term, in its entirety.Course Fees. Course fees are assessed for courses that incur unusual or extra expense. These expenditures are made on the basis of course registrations. Therefore, no refund is allowed for these fees.Overload Charges. Full refunds will be made for overload charges up to the second Friday of the term. No refunds for overloads will be allowed after that time.13COLLEGE EXPENSES; REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREESAlma College CreditAlma College defines its credit hour in the context of the 4-4-1 calendar, just as institutions using semester systems link their cred-its to that calendar. The credit value of Alma courses is measured by “the Alma College 4-4-1 Credit Hour,” hereafter referred to as an “Alma credit.”An Alma credit is equivalent to 120/136 – or, rounded to nearest tenth, .9 –  of a semester credit hour. It is likewise equivalent to 136/108 –or, rounded, 1.3 – of a quarter credit hour. These equiva-lences are used when calculating compliance with the federal definition of the credit hour (34"

CFR 600,".2): A credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achieve-ment that is an institutionally-established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than:(1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a min-imum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or 10–12 weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or(2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in para-graph (1) of this definition for other activities as established by an institution, including laboratory work, internships, prac-tica, studio work, and other academic work leading toward the award of credit hours.Area of ConcentrationEach student must declare an area of concentration before the end of the sophomore year by filing the approved form with the Registrar’s Office. This area of concentration may be a Departmen-tal Major (at least 36 credits as prescribed by the department), an Interdepartmental Major (56 credits in courses approved by two or more departments and the Educational Policy Committee), or a Program of Emphasis [POE] (56–68 credits in courses selected by the student to meet a specific educational goal as approved by the POE Committee no later than November 15 of the junior year).The GPA in the area of concentration must be at least 2.0 (“C”) for the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music and Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees. For the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree, a 3.0 GPA in the major is required. For teacher certification purposes, a 2.75 GPA is required for all coursework. For additional certification requirements please see the Education Department section of this catalog. Courses outside the area of concentration must total 68 credits.Comprehensive EvaluationMost departments require graduating seniors to complete a comprehensive evaluation. Departments will determine the form of the comprehensive evaluation and may require students to take a nationally normed test, such as the Graduate Record Examina-tion. Regardless of the form of the evaluation, the department shall determine the minimum criteria for passing with distinction, passing and failing.Departments have the discretion to require satisfactory per-formance on a comprehensive evaluation for completion of the major. Results of evaluations that are non-credit bearing will not be recorded on the student’s transcript.Failure of the comprehensive evaluation will not affect degree status unless a department specifies that successful completion is necessary to satisfy major requirements. Students may retake the comprehensive evaluation only with the permission of the department (or in the case of a POE, the POE Subcommittee of the Educational Policy Committee of the faculty). Only the results of the most recent effort will be recorded.Contact HoursSixty minutes a week of classroom or direct faculty instruction constitutes 1 contact hour.Room and Board.

The student completes all requirements for both degrees.Note: Students who earn a Bachelor of Music degree cannot also earn a Bachelor of Arts degree unless they qualify on the basis of a major other than music. Students who earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree cannot also earn a Bachelor of Arts degree unless they qualify on the basis of a major other than art.Students who desire multiple degrees must notify the Regis-trar’s Office by the end of the term prior to the one in which they plan to graduate. All degrees for which a student qualifies will be awarded as completed.Double-counting CreditsA student may count up to eight credits of one major or minor in a different major or minor when those courses appear within the requirements, unless a department states otherwise within a departmental listing.If a course is a required prerequisite or cognate to a major, it is automatically available for application to a different major or minor when that course appears within the requirements.Note that no course, which counts toward any teaching major or teaching minor, may count toward any other teaching major or teaching minor.Graduation Requirements and Full Time EnrollmentThe minimum number of Alma credits required for graduation is 136. A full-time student shall take between 13 and 18 credits in each Fall or Winter term, with 16 credits being a standard load, and work beyond 18 credits constituting overload. Full-time enrollment shall be 4 credits in each Spring Term.LimitationsOf the 136–156 credits required for a degree, students may ap-ply up to the following number of credits from the classes listed here:8 credits Music 151, 152, 153, 153G,154, 155, 156, 157, 158 and 1596 credits Exercise and Health Science 100–1658 credits Theatre/Dance 150, 151 and 1528 credits Practicums (numbered 385 or 386 in any department)24 credits Independent Study (in a single department)36 credits Practicum, Independent Study, Field Experience, Internship or Directed Teaching  (in total)A minimum of 68 credits applied toward graduation must be earned at Alma College or through Alma College-approved programs. Credit earned by enrollment in English as a Second Language, "
ACP 100,", "
EDC 090,", or "
EDC 091," do not count toward the 136–156 credits required for graduation.Programs of Emphasis (POEs)With the assistance of a faculty advisor, students may design an area of concentration composed of 56–68 credits in courses chosen to meet specific educational or career goals. In recent years, students have graduated with POEs in such fields as arts management, political science, environmental policy and sustain-ability, and music technology. For more information, contact the Registrar’s Office.Residency RequirementSeniors are required to enroll in classes offered on the Alma campus or through Alma College programs during the Fall and Winter terms immediately prior to graduation.Spring Term RequirementsTwo Spring Term courses must be successfully completed, one of which must be a designated S (“S”) course. Transfer students of sophomore standing or above must successfully complete one Spring Term course and it must be an S course. These designations are found in the Spring Term course booklet published each January.S courses take advantage of the unique format of Spring Term and provide learning opportunities not possible within a traditional academic term. The Registrar’s Office maintains a list of approved S courses. A term spent off campus in an approved Alma College program (ex. Philadelphia, Germany, France, etc.) may meet the S requirement. The student must still take two Spring Terms.15REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES; GENERAL EDUCATION GOALSThe purpose of the general education program is to provide each student with a broad liberal arts education and a solid foundation for all fields of concentration. The following goals have been established for the general education curriculum.1. Depth of knowledge in one or more disciplines. Through majors, minors and POEs, all students will achieve mastery in one or more focused disciplinary or approved interdisciplinary path(s) of study.2. Breadth of knowledge in the Liberal Arts tradition. Stu-dents will demonstrate comprehension and application of the different ways of knowing in disciplines from the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences.3. Effective communication. Students will demonstrate abilities to communicate effectively, in a variety of settings and for diverse audiences, through writing, speaking and other forms of expression.4. Development of intellectual tools. Students will demonstrate skills in critical analysis, quantitative and qualitative analysis and synthesis, scientific methods, and the use of information resources and technology.5. Understanding of societies and cultures. Students will develop understanding of:• the variety in human cultures, societies, histories, and aes-thetic and ethical systems both within their own nation and in the larger global community;• the interrelationships between different parts of the global community;• their own place within and responsibility to this community.To achieve the major objective of each area outlined above, students must complete courses or demonstrate proficiency in a variety of disciplines. Transferred courses must be approved for application.LiteraciesAlma College assumes that incoming students will have devel-oped the basic skills for reading, listening and studying to a level adequate for success at the beginning level of college. Programs are available to support students who wish to improve their skills in these areas.CompositionStudents are urged to complete the first year writing course in their first year and are required to have done so by graduation. During orientation, they receive a recommendation about whether to take the transition course in writing, "
ENG 101,", and discuss the recommendation with their advisors. This recommendation is based on the student’s responses to a short questionnaire and their standardized writing test scores.As a requirement for graduation, each student will successfully complete 16 credits of designated Quill writing courses. These credits will include  (or its equivalent) during the first year of residency, as well as at least one upper level Quill course (2 or 4 credits) in the student’s major field of study.By definition, a Quill course is designed to improve the qual-ity of student writing. To qualify as a Quill course, at least 25 percent of the final course grade must be based on written work, and at least 15 percent of the final course grade must be based on written work that has been submitted, evaluated, revised and resubmitted for final evaluation. In this catalog, Quill courses are marked with a .MathematicsAll students are required to successfully complete at least four credits of college-level mathematical or computational science coursework as part of the Distributive Requirements listed on the following page. To ensure that all entering students are prepared for college-level work in mathematics, the College will determine the mathematical competency level of all entering freshmen and transfer students. Students who are not exempt on the basis of a qualifying ACT Mathematics sub-score are required to take a placement exam to determine a recommended initial course. , 201, or 202 with a grade of “C” or better, plus 12 additional credits of Quill writing courses.

(cid:143)Because graduate programs in Art History typically requireproficiency in at least two foreign languages, students whoare considering advanced studies in this discipline shouldplan to include at least four terms of foreign languagecoursework in their curriculum. (cid:143)A Program of Emphasis (P.O.E.) in Art History or in Arts orGallery Management is also available in consultation withthe Art History faculty. Art History courses aresupplemented with other appropriate courses in coordinatedisciplines (Business, Anthropology, History, ReligiousStudies, etc.). Each P.O.E. is tailored to the student'sparticular interests and goals. (cid:143)Completion of a senior thesis is strongly encouraged ifstudent is considering graduate school.
