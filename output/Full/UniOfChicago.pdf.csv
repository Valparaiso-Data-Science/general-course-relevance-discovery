A minimum of 4200 units of credit (forty-two 100-unit courses) is required for the undergraduate degree. Of all credits earned, at least 3800 must be earned viacourse enrollment, as opposed to credit earned via examination.Students choose courses across the curriculum in consultation with College advisers and faculty counselors.Courses valued at less than 100 units may not be used to satisfy degree requirements.General EducationGeneral education requirements are designed to teach the skills of critical inquiry, argumentation, andanalytical thinking in both quantitative and qualitative settings. These requirements are largely completed withintegrated, often interdisciplinary, sequences comprised of two or three courses. (Note: The courses designed tosatisfy these requirements cannot be replaced by other courses, except in the sciences, as indicated. Substitutesfor general education courses are rarely approved (1) to accommodate a second major or a minor, or (2) to avoidcurricular and scheduling conflicts that result from postponing general education requirements until a student'sthird or fourth year.)Meant to be a foundation for later study at the College, the general education requirements are aquintessential element of the University of Chicago experience and should be completed by the end of the secondyear. Most general education requirements are completed with sequences comprised of two or three courses.These requirements are completed with 1500 units of credit (fifteen 100-unit courses) spread over sevenareas of study. These seven general education requirements fall into three broad categories. Students must alsosatisfy a language competence requirement, which is outlined below.1. Humanities, Civilization Studies, and the Arts (total: 600 units/6 quarter courses)Students take a total of six quarter courses in this category, distributed in the following way: at least twoquarters in the humanities, at least two quarters in civilization studies, and at least one quarter in the arts. Theremaining (sixth) course may be taken in any one of these categories. Each of these requirements has its owndetailed page under the heading "The Curriculum" in this catalog.An essential component of general education is learning how to appreciate and analyze texts intellectually,historically, and aesthetically. Through this general education requirement, students learn how to interpretliterary, philosophical, and historical texts in depth; how to identify significant intellectual problems posedby those texts; and how to discuss and write about them perceptively and persuasively. They also learn howto study a visual or performing art form and how to study texts and art forms within a specific cultural andchronological frame.2. Natural Sciences (Biological Sciences and Physical Sciences) and Mathematical Sciences (total:600 units/6 quarter courses)Students take a total of six quarter courses in this category, distributed in the following way: at least twoquarters of physical sciences, at least two quarters of biological sciences, and at least one in mathematicalsciences. The remaining (sixth) course may be taken in any one of these categories, unless calculus is being usedto satisfy the requirement in mathematical sciences. In that case, the student must take two calculus courses forthe general education requirement. In general, be aware that a student's major and/or preparation for the healthprofessions may dictate which of the available options the student should select.Courses and sequences in the natural sciences are designed to explore significant features of the naturaluniverse and to examine the exciting process of scientific inquiry. These courses consider the powers andlimitations of diverse forms of scientific observation, scientific reasoning, and natural laws. Courses in themathematical sciences develop the powers of formal reasoning through use of precise artificial languages foundin mathematics, computer science, statistics, or formal logic.Each of these requirements has its own detailed page under the heading "The Curriculum" in this catalog.3. Social Sciences (total: 300 units/3 quarter courses)Each of these year-long (three-quarter) social sciences sequences introduces fundamental questions andtheories from the social sciences and shows how they enhance our understanding of important issues facing theworld. Some sequences focus on classic texts, others on substantive fields of inquiry or research methodologies,but all explore how the social sciences formulate questions and inquire into the nature of social life through actsof imagination as well as through systematic analysis. The social sciences general education curriculum requiresactive engagement in small seminars, close reading, and analytic writing; some sequences may also includelectures.Courses must be taken in sequence. Once students begin a sequence, they are expected to remain in the samesequence. NOTE: Students registered in any of the social sciences sequences must attend the first and second2018-2019 The College            7class sessions or their registration will be dropped. This requirement has its own detailed page under the heading"The Curriculum" in this catalog.Major ProgramsMore than a set of course credits, a sound major is an effort to understand the methods and experienceof a discipline or interdisciplinary field. Majors complement the breadth of the University of Chicago generaleducation requirements with an opportunity to come to grips with the depth of knowledge and the complexitiesof developing knowledge in a particular area of inquiry. Majors range from nine to nineteen courses, though themajority of them require between ten and fourteen courses. Each major is described in detail in the Programs ofStudy section of the catalog.More than half of the requirements for a major must be met by registering for courses bearing University ofChicago course numbers. Courses used to meet general education requirements cannot also be counted toward amajor.Students officially declare a major through the student portal (my.uchicago.edu), but they should meet withtheir College adviser and with the director of undergraduate studies in the department as part of that process.Students may declare a major starting in their second year; unless otherwise specified by the department, thedeadline for declaring a major is Spring Quarter of a student's third year.The following major programs are available in the:Biological Sciences Collegiate Division (BSCD)Biological SciencesNeuroscienceHumanities Collegiate Division (HCD)Art HistoryCinema and Media StudiesClassical StudiesComparative LiteratureCreative WritingEast Asian Languages and CivilizationsEnglish Language and LiteratureGender and Sexuality StudiesGermanic StudiesInterdisciplinary Studies in the HumanitiesJewish StudiesLinguisticsMedieval StudiesMusicNear Eastern Languages and CivilizationsPhilosophy (Options: Philosophy; Philosophy and Allied Fields)Romance Languages and LiteraturesRussian and East European StudiesSouth Asian Languages and CivilizationsTheater and Performance StudiesVisual ArtsNew Collegiate Division (NCD)Fundamentals: Issues and TextsLaw, Letters, and SocietyReligious StudiesTutorial StudiesPhysical Sciences Collegiate Division (PSCD)AstrophysicsBiological ChemistryChemistryComputational and Applied MathematicsComputer ScienceEnvironmental ScienceGeophysical SciencesMathematics (Options: Applied Mathematics; Mathematics; Mathematics with Specialization inEconomics)Molecular EngineeringPhysics (Options: Physics; Physics with Specialization in Astrophysics)StatisticsSocial Sciences Collegiate Division (SSCD)Anthropology8         The CurriculumComparative Human DevelopmentComparative Race and Ethnic StudiesEconomicsEnvironmental and Urban StudiesGeographical SciencesGlobal StudiesHistoryHistory, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and MedicineLatin American and Caribbean StudiesPolitical SciencePsychologyPublic Policy StudiesSociologyElectivesThe number of courses required for a major primarily determines the number of general electives requiredfor an individual student. A student needs at least forty-two 100-unit courses to graduate: fifteen toward generaleducation and twenty-seven more split between the major and electives. Programs that specify thirteen coursesrequire fourteen electives; twelve-course majors require fifteen electives, and so on.Additionally, the amount of credit by examination (e.g., AP, IB, placement credit, etc.) may also impact thenumber of electives required. For students matriculating in Autumn 2017 or later, of the 4200 units requiredto graduate, at least 3800 units must be completed via course enrollment, i.e., not credit by examination. Forexample, a student who satisfies more than 400 units of general education or major requirements throughexamination may increase the number of electives required.Elective courses may be taken in any subject matter or discipline, including the same discipline as thestudent's major. They provide students the opportunity to shape their studies toward their distinctive curiositiesand interests. At their broadest, they provide an opportunity to explore freely across the richness of opportunitiesfor learning at the University of Chicago.Courses taken in exploration of alternative majors and in study abroad programs, as well as courserequirements completed by examination, are often included in electives. Some students also choose to usegroups of electives to create minors or second majors. These options, though suitable ways to formalize students'interests outside their major, should not be undertaken in the mistaken belief that they necessarily enhance astudent's transcript. Courses taken as electives should not displace courses in, and should not displace attentionto, the student's general education program and major.Credit for language courses, whether it is earned by course registration or petition, is usually countedtoward electives, unless a major requires or permits language courses for credit as part of the major. Coursesused to satisfy the language competence requirement ordinarily contribute to the elective totals.Minor ProgramsSome majors offer minors to students in other fields of study, and a few programs offer minors only. Aminor requires five to seven courses, all of which count toward the student's general elective totals. Courses ina minor cannot be (1) double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors, or (2) counted towardgeneral education requirements. Courses in a minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of therequirements for a minor must be met by registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.For specific requirements, see the descriptions of the programs listed below that appear elsewhere in this catalog.Students can indicate their interest in a minor via the student portal (my.uchicago.edu), but can onlyofficially declare a minor by meeting with the director of undergraduate studies in the department and with theirCollege adviser. Students submit to their College adviser the director's approval for the minor on a form obtainedfrom the adviser. The deadline for declaring a minor is Spring Quarter of a student's third year.Minor programs are offered in the following areas:Architectural Studies (from Art History)Art HistoryAstronomy and AstrophysicsBiological SciencesChemistryCinema and Media StudiesClassical StudiesComparative Race and Ethnic StudiesComputational Neuroscience (from Biological Sciences)Computer ScienceDigital Studies of Language, Culture, and HistoryEast Asian Languages and CivilizationsEnglish and Creative WritingEnvironmental and Urban Studies2018-2019 The College            9Gender and Sexuality StudiesGermanic StudiesHistoryHistory, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and MedicineHuman RightsJewish StudiesLatin American and Caribbean StudiesLinguisticsMathematicsMedia Arts and DesignMedieval StudiesMolecular EngineeringMolecular Engineering Technology and InnovationMusicNear Eastern Languages and CivilizationsNeuroscienceNorwegian StudiesPhilosophyPhysicsReligious StudiesRenaissance StudiesRomance Languages and LiteraturesRussian and East European StudiesSouth Asian Languages and CivilizationsStatisticsTheater and Performance StudiesVisual ArtsWhile not a minor, the Dougan Scholars Certificate Program (http://www.chicagobooth.edu/programs/full-time/admissions/early-career-candidates/dougan-scholars-program) is a selective program forundergraduate students offered by the Booth School of Business. The Chicago Studies Program (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu) also offers a certificate for students who complete a series of courses andcocurricular activities related to the city of Chicago.Language CompetenceStudents in the College are required to possess understanding of more than one culture and to demonstratecompetence in a language other than English. The language competence requirement must be met bydemonstrating linguistic proficiency equivalent to one year of college-level study. For information about whichlanguages are currently being taught and which may be used to meet the language competence requirement,visit humanities.uchicago.edu/about/languages-uchicago.Students who matriculate in or after September 2009 may meet the language competence requirement in oneof the following ways:•passing a College-administered competency examination. The language competency exams aregiven each Winter Quarter; students can sign up through their advisers. To qualify for the competencyexam, students must have placed into the second year of that language or completed an approvedbeginning-level sequence at another institution with a C or above (see Transfer Credit rules);•completing (with a quality grade) the third course of a first-year language sequence or a higher-level course offered at the University of Chicago;•receiving a score of 5 on an AP examination in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin,or Spanish, or a score of 5 or above on an IB Higher Level (HL) exam in a foreign language;•placing into 10300 or higher in a foreign language offered at the University of Chicago, thenparticipating in one of the College's study abroad programs (visit study-abroad.uchicago.edu for moreinformation) where that language is spoken and completing (with a quality grade) a language courseat the intermediate or advanced level;•participating in a College-approved one-quarter intensive foreign language study abroadprogram and completing all required courses with a quality grade (visit study-abroad.uchicago.edufor more information);•passing one of the College's Practical or Advanced Language Proficiency assessments in a foreignlanguage. File the Language Petition (https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions),using the second option, to complete the requirement; or•taking approved intermediate-level (or above) courses at another institution and passing with a Bor above. (See Transfer Credit rules.)Students who are foreign nationals may meet the language competence requirement if their formalschooling experience in a country other than the United States enables them to demonstrate the criteria ofcultural understanding and language competence described above. They must submit a petition (https://10         The Curriculumcollege.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) to Catherine Baumann (Cobb 214, 773.702.8008,ccbauman@uchicago.edu). Supporting documentation must also be provided; the requirement is notautomatically waived.NOTE: Students are strongly urged to complete the language competence requirement in their first twoyears in the College. Students who wish to establish language proficiency via summer course work should seethe Summer Language Institute (https://summerlanguages.uchicago.edu)’s offerings.After meeting the language competence requirement, students may work toward Practical andAdvanced Foreign Language Proficiency Certificates. More information can be found here (https://languageassessment.uchicago.edu/page/foreign-language-proficiency-certificates). (http://college.uchicago.edu/academics-advising/academic-opportunities/advanced-language-proficiency)PetitionsAny student who wishes to appeal for special consideration under a College regulation or an interpretationthereof may file a petition (http://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/GeneralPetition.pdf) withthe Dean of Students in the College. Students are encouraged to speak to their adviser for more information.Physical EducationPhysical education is not required for an undergraduate degree. However, students are encouraged topursue physical fitness as part of their College experience. For further information on fitness opportunities, visitathletics.uchicago.edu.Archived CatalogsStudents fulfill requirements that are in place when they enter the College.

Since the 1930s the curriculum of the College has varied in its details, but its intellectualfoundations have been constant.Undergraduate education at Chicago begins with a common core curriculum, conducted from thestandpoint of multiple disciplines but beholden to none, which provides opportunities for critical inquiry and thediscovery of knowledge. Chicago's long-standing commitment to a rigorous core of general education for first-and second-year students emphasizes the unique value of studying original texts and of formulating originalproblems based on the study of those texts. The objective of our faculty-taught general education courses—whichconstitute the major component of the first two years in the College—is not to transfer information, but to raisefundamental questions and to encourage those habits of mind and those critical, analytical, and writing skills thatare most urgent to a well-informed member of civil society.Just as general education provides a foundation for addressing key intellectual questions, the major programof study insists upon depth of knowledge and sophistication in a defined field—whether a traditional academicdiscipline, an interdisciplinary program, or, in unusual cases, a program of the student's own design undertakenin conjunction with a tutor. Majors afford students invaluable opportunities to develop and defend complexarguments by means of extended scholarly research.The curriculum, however, extends beyond the general education requirements and the major. The facultyhas always believed that maturity and independence of mind are enhanced by exploration in intellectualuniverses outside or transcending required programs of study. Electives—that is, courses drawn from othermajors, independent research projects, programs of overseas study, and advanced training in a second language—provide a breadth and a balance that is critical to a true liberal education. Hence the Chicago curriculumallows up to one-third of a student's academic work to consist of electives that will build upon the work of ourgeneral education courses, but do so on more advanced and more focused levels.Many national figures in higher education have been identified with Chicago's undergraduate curriculum—including William Rainey Harper, Robert Maynard Hutchins, and Edward Levi—but learning at Chicago hasnever been the province of one person or one vision. Rather, the curriculum devoted to "the knowledge mostworth having," and the critical cast of mind that it develops, has been the product of generations of collegialdebate and constant re-examination, processes which are themselves a part of the intellectual adventure to whichthe curriculum is devoted.12         Academic Regulations and ProceduresAcademic Regulationsand ProceduresBecause students are held responsible for this information, they are encouraged to discuss any questionsthey have with their College advisers. For a general overview, students are urged to review the Policies andRegulations (http://registrar.uchicago.edu/policies-regulations) page published by the University Registrar. Thefollowing pages describe some of the College's regulations and procedures in greater detail.•Academic and Enrollment Statuses•Course and Grade Policies•Registration•Academic Advising•Academic Integrity2018-2019 The College            13Academic and Enrollment StatusesAcademic Probation and SuspensionIn each quarter of registration, students must complete, by the end of the quarter, 300 units of course creditwith passing grades and with a minimum GPA of 2.0. Incompletes are not considered sufficient for coursecompletion.A student who fails to meet this minimum requirement will ordinarily be placed on academic probationfor the following quarter. Academic probation is a formal sanction but is not permanently notated on the officialtranscript.Students on academic probation are expected to complete, by the end of the quarter, 300 units of coursecredit with passing grades in the next quarter of registration and with a minimum GPA of 2.0. Please note thatIncompletes are not sufficient for course completion. Students on academic probation who meet those minimumexpectations will be returned to good standing at the end of the quarter. Any student who fails to meet theminimum requirements while on probation will ordinarily be asked to leave the College for a period of time,usually at least one year.If any student fails to complete, by the end of a quarter, a minimum of 300 units of course work and alsofails to attain a GPA minimum of 2.0 in the same quarter, the student may be immediately suspended regardlessof whether the preceding quarter was satisfactory.NOTE: Students on financial aid who fail to meet the completion rate (70 percent of registered courses) andGPA requirements and/or fail to complete their degree within 150% of the program timeframe may jeopardizetheir financial aid packages.For the purpose of determining eligibility to participate in varsity sports, all students eligible to register areconsidered to be in good standing.Extended Enrollment StatusStudents who (1) have satisfied their course requirements for graduation and (2) are within their 12 quartersof enrollment but (3) still have outstanding work to complete, namely BA theses or Incompletes, may request tospend their final quarter of enrollment in "Extended" status. Students must make the request with their Collegeadviser prior to the end of the first week of the quarter during which the student intends to be on ExtendedEnrollment Status. Students in Extended Enrollment Status do not register for courses but retain many privilegesafforded to students. Students should ask their College adviser about administrative fees associated with thisstatus.Students in Extended Enrollment Status will be expected to graduate at the end of the Extended quarter.If a student does not graduate at the end of the Extended quarter, the student will be placed in the status of NoFurther Enrollments Required, if applicable.No Further Enrollments RequiredStudents who have either (a) exceeded their 12 quarters of enrollment but still have work to completeor (b) exceeded their one quarter of Extended Enrollment Status will be placed in a status called No FurtherEnrollments Required. Students on this status will not pay any fees and will retain access to the Library andUniversity email. Students may remain in this status until they have reached the maximum of eight quartersof leave, cumulative or consecutive, after which they will be administratively withdrawn from the College.However, petitions may be granted to extend a leave for up to 12 cumulative quarters for students as areasonable accommodation for a disability or otherwise as required by law. Students seeking an exception to theeight-quarter maximum must petition the College Dean of Students no later than the end of the eighth quarter ofleave.Leaves of AbsenceStudents planning a leave should consult with their College adviser and also arrange for an interview withone of the deans in the Office of the Dean of Students. For full tuition refund, a leave of absence must be arrangedeither at the end of the quarter prior to the leave or by Friday of first week of the quarter that a student is goingto be on leave. For the refund schedule, visit bursar.uchicago.edu/tuition-refund-schedule.In connection with certain leaves (e.g., some medical leaves or leaves taken because of behavioral issues), thedean of students may require, among other things, information from a physician or therapist as a condition forresumption of studies. All conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis.Withdrawing from the CollegeStudents who decide not to return to the College must formally withdraw their registration. To do so,students should contact the Office of the Dean of Students in the College. At the time of withdrawal, students areadvised of the conditions under which they may resume their studies in the College. For a complete overview of14         Academic and Enrollment StatusesCollege policies regarding leaves of absence and withdrawals, visit https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/leave-absence-withdrawal.Applying to Graduate with Non-active Enrollment StatusesStudents in Extended Enrollment Status or in the status of No Further Enrollments Required, or withdrawnas described above, can apply to graduate provided they have:1. met all of their remaining graduation requirements and have cleared all restrictions;2. informed their College advisers; and3. submitted a College Degree Application Form by the Friday of the first week of the quarter. TheCollege adviser can provide this form.Twelfth Grade CertificatesStudents who entered the College before graduation from high school and who expect to qualify for aTwelfth Grade Certificate in the Spring Quarter should file an application with the registrar before the first weekof Spring Quarter of their first year. In order to be eligible for the certificate, they must have completed duringtheir first academic year a minimum of nine courses with an overall GPA of 1.75 or higher. Certificates are mailedfollowing the end of Spring Quarter. No certificate is awarded without an application.2018-2019 The College            15Course and Grade PoliciesGrading ScaleThe following grades are awarded in undergraduate courses:Letter GradeGrade Point AverageA4.0A–3.7B+3.3B3.0B–2.7C+2.3C2.0C–1.7D+1.3D1.0F0.0PN/A (See below)WN/A (See below)NGRN/A (See below)IN/A (See below)The grades A through F are known as quality grades and carry a specific weight in calculating official gradepoint averages (GPA). The mark F indicates unsatisfactory work and does not confer credit. A grade of F may notbe subsequently changed, except when entered in error by the instructor or the registrar. Be aware that while a Dis considered passing, some programs require a higher grade minimum for any course counting in the major orminor.These averages are regularly calculated to determine Dean's List, academic probation, and general honors.They may influence awards like Phi Beta Kappa and departmental honors. Note that College students who takea course at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business may receive an A+ grade according to the ChicagoBooth grade system, but will receive 4.0 grade points in the College grade system for that Chicago Booth course.For College students, other Chicago Booth grades convert to grade points according to the College scale above.NOTE: Only grades for University of Chicago courses are calculated into a student's GPA. Grades fromcourses taken at other institutions do not contribute to the GPA. Grades from off-campus study abroad ordomestic programs do not contribute to the GPA unless the courses are listed on the transcript with University ofChicago course numbers.Pass/Fail GradingStudents who wish to receive a passing grade rather than a quality grade have one option open to them:Pass/Fail (P/F). Students considering P/F grading should consult with their College adviser early in the quarterbecause this option is subject to conditions and restrictions. Whether a course with a grade of P can be countedtoward a student's degree depends on how it is to be used in the student's program. All general educationcourses must be taken for quality grades, and most courses satisfying requirements in the major must be takenfor quality grades. However, some majors permit a limited number of P marks. For P/F grading, the student andinstructor reach an informal agreement, at the discretion of the instructor and according to departmental policy,before the instructor submits a grade for the course; no action is required by the student's adviser.The P grade indicates that the student has submitted sufficient evidence to receive a passing grade. As somedepartments give credit only for a grade of C– or higher, students should establish with the instructor whatconstitutes passing work. A mark of P may not later be changed to a quality grade, and a quality grade may notbe changed to a P. Although the P confers course credit, it is not calculated in the GPA. Students who do notpass a P/F course receive an F, which counts as a zero in the calculation of the GPA. A grade of F may not besubsequently changed, except when entered in error by the instructor or the registrar.Course WithdrawalsThe “W” (Withdrawn) grade means that the student has decided after week 3 of the quarter not to completethe work of the course. Students who wish to exercise this option must request a W from their adviser by theFriday of 10th week or the day before the final project/exam is due, whichever is earlier. When made before thedeadline, a request for a withdrawal cannot be denied except in cases of academic dishonesty. A withdrawal maynot be granted after completion of the course.16         Course and Grade PoliciesOnce a student requests a W, it may not subsequently be changed to any other mark. W grades do not confergrade or impact GPA; however, they will count against the completion rate needed to maintain good academicstanding.Students who register for graduate-level courses are subject to the policies governing graduate grading.Students should discuss the implications of these policies with their advisers before registering for coursesnumbered 30000 and above. NOTE: Grades earned in graduate-level courses contribute to a student's GPA asindicated earlier in this section.IncompletesThe mark “I” (Incomplete) is intended for a student who has not completed the requirements of a coursebefore the end of the quarter but who has1.participated actively in the course,2.completed the majority of the requirements of the course with work that is of a passing quality, and3.made satisfactory arrangements with the instructor to complete the remaining work.The student must submit the request for an Incomplete to the instructor before the end of the course.Approval to complete work late is at the discretion of the instructor and/or according to departmental policy.The student is also responsible for completing and submitting an official Incomplete Form, which must beobtained from the student’s College adviser and turned into the registrar’s office by Friday of the first week ofthe following quarter. After this point, students who are otherwise qualified for an "I" may petition the Dean ofStudents in the College for approval to arrange the Incomplete. If the required form has not been submitted bythe deadline, a grade of "W" will be entered for the course.Incompletes must be finished within a period of time agreed upon between student and instructor. In theabsence of a specified due date, the work must be completed within one year. In the interim, an "I" will appear inplace of a grade. When the course is completed, the "I" notation will remain on the academic record alongside thestudent’s final grade, indicating that the work was completed outside the course’s standard timeframe. Studentswith compelling reasons for the Incomplete may petition the Dean of Students in the College to remove the "I"from the transcript.If the course work has not been completed within the specified time period and an extension has not beengranted, the student will receive a W unless the instructor indicates a specific grade on the Incomplete Form.NGR (No Grade)The mark “NGR” (No Grade) is entered on the student’s grade report by the registrar’s office when theinstructor has failed to submit a final grade for a student. The NGR may be resolved by submission of a finalgrade or a formal Incomplete Form. If neither has been submitted by Friday of the first week of the followingquarter, the NGR will be converted into a W. After this point, students who are otherwise qualified for anIncomplete may petition the Dean of Students in the College for approval to arrange the Incomplete.When a final grade is submitted to replace an NGR, that grade will be entered on the academic record withan "I" notation, indicating that the work was completed outside the course’s standard timeframe. That "I" may beremoved only if the instructor states that the student’s work was completed before the end of the quarter or if thestudent successfully petitions the Dean of Students in the College.The intermediary NGR should not be interpreted as an informal Incomplete or as a way to avoid an "I" onthe transcript. Rather, students are strongly urged to protect themselves against misunderstandings and misseddeadlines by arranging for an official Incomplete if one proves necessary.Academic ProbationIn each quarter of registration, students must complete, by the end of the quarter, 300 units of course creditwith passing grades and with a minimum GPA of 2.0. Incompletes are not considered sufficient for coursecompletion. A student who fails to meet this minimum requirement will ordinarily be placed on academicprobation for the following quarter. For details and information about implications, please see the "AcademicProbation and Suspension" section on the Academic and Enrollment Statuses page.Dean's ListDegree-seeking students whose cumulative grade point averages are 3.25 or above for an academic year(in which they have completed a minimum of nine courses with at least seven quality grades) are placed on theDean's List for that year and their official transcripts are marked accordingly. Students are only considered forDean’s List once all of their grades for the academic year have been recorded. A determination is made each yearon the basis of grades available in the registrar's office after July 1. For course work that does not contribute to theGPA, see Grading Scale.HonorsFor honors within a major, students should refer to that department's program description for the eligibilityrequirements. Students are awarded general honors at the time of graduation if their overall GPA is 3.25 or2018-2019 The College            17above. For the purposes of assessing eligibility for honors, major GPA and overall GPA are calculated based oncourses taken in all quarters except for the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. For information oncourse work that does not contribute to the GPA, see Grading Scale.Class AttendanceIt is the expectation of the College that students will attend all classes for which they have registered.Nevertheless, it is up to the individual department, faculty member, or instructor to set the attendance policyfor their individual courses. Students should keep in mind that attendance at the first class is required in manycourses to confirm enrollment. Many courses will automatically drop students who do not attend the firstclass meeting or even the entire first week of class meetings. The academic calendar can be found at academic-calendar.uchicago.edu.Course LoadA full-time course load is three or four courses per quarter; the tuition is the same in either case. Over thetypical four-year program (i.e., twelve quarters), a student who registers for six four-course quarters and sixthree-course quarters will successfully reach the 4200 units of credit required to graduate.Students who wish to take a fifth course in a given quarter, pushing them over 400 units of credit, mustformally petition (http://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/GeneralPetition.pdf) the Dean ofStudents in the College for permission to do so. To confirm the instructor’s willingness to allow a late registrationinto the course and the student’s participation in the course, the petition must include a signed consent form fromthe instructor. The petition will be considered in week 3 of the quarter.Although students may progress at varying rates toward the degree, no student may register for more than12 quarters without the permission of the Dean of Students in the College. No student may register for more than13 quarters.Repetition of CoursesWhen a student repeats a course, both courses appear on the student's transcript and both grades areaveraged into the student's GPA. However, only one registration for the course counts toward the total numberof credits required for graduation.In the quarter that a course is repeated, students on financial aid must register for 300 units in additionto the repeated course unless (1) a failing grade was received in a course that a student needs to meet generaleducation requirements or requirements in their major, or (2) the student’s major mandates a higher grade thanwas previously received.Reading PeriodTwo days of every academic quarter (Thursday and Friday of tenth week) are designated "College Readingand Review Period." Instructors and/or teaching assistants may hold review sessions on these days. However, nonew material may be introduced, assignments may not be due, and final examinations may not be given (exceptas necessary for graduating students) during the reading period. The Reading and Review Period may not bedispensed with by classroom vote.Examination ScheduleStudents should verify that travel arrangements do not conflict with their final examinations. For the Collegeexamination schedule, visit registrar.uchicago.edu/final-exams.18         Earning a DegreeEarning a DegreeRequirements for the DegreeThe College awards the BA or the BS degree to qualified students who are recommended by the faculty. Inorder to qualify for the degree, students must complete the following:1.The general education requirements2.The requirements of a major program3.The minimum number of electives4.The language competency requirement5.Course credit for a minimum of 42 quarter courses (4200 units): This number may be reached inpart by examination where appropriate. For students matriculating in Autumn 2017 or later, of the4200 units, 3800 units of credit must be earned by course enrollment. Course enrollments may includedirect enrollment study abroad programs affiliated with the College and approved transfer credit.6.An overall GPA of 1.75 and a GPA of 2.0 in the major7.A residency requirement: A student must be in residence at the University of Chicago campusfor at least six quarters and must successfully complete a minimum of 1800 units of credit while inresidence. NOTE: Certain College-sponsored study abroad programs (chiefly the civilization studiesprograms) may be used to meet this residency and course requirement.8.Completion of a degree application prior to the quarter in which the degree is to be received9.Payment of all outstanding bills and return of all equipment and library books2018-2019 The College            19RegistrationPre-registrationAt the end of each quarter, students in residence preregister for the following quarter. Prior to AutumnQuarter, each student must confirm that he or she will be a registered student in Autumn Quarter. To confirm,please go to https://confirm.uchicago.edu.Registration ChangesCourse registration may be changed during the first three weeks of each quarter. A change of registrationis any course "drop," any course "add," or any substitution of one course for another. No changes in registrationare permitted after Friday of third week without a petition to a dean in the Office of the Dean of Students. Fordetails, visit college.uchicago.edu/academics-advising/course-selection-registration/add-/-drop.Registration for Professional School CoursesIf certain requirements are met, advanced undergraduates may register for up to six courses in the followingprofessional schools at the University of Chicago: the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, the LawSchool, the School of Social Service Administration, or the Irving B. Harris Graduate School of Public PolicyStudies. With the exception of Chicago Booth courses, interested students must petition to the Office of theDean of Students in the College for approval to register for a professional school course. This petition mustbe submitted in the quarter prior to the quarter of planned registration. Students interested in Chicago Boothcourses must follow their guidelines for registration at https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/chicago-booth-school-business. For more information about requirements and registration procedures, students should consulttheir College advisers.NOTE: Professional school courses generally do not substitute for courses in the major; and no more thanfour can count toward the forty-two courses (4200 units) required in an undergraduate degree program.RestrictionsThe privilege of registration (as well as the use of University services and facilities) will be denied studentswho have been placed on restriction. Restriction may result from a student's failure to fulfill financial obligationsto the University or to comply with University rules and regulations. Whenever possible, students are warnedof an impending restriction and are notified when one has been imposed. Students must clear the restrictionwith the administrative or academic office which imposed it before they can register for subsequent quarters. Formore information, visit registrar.uchicago.edu/page/restrictions-and-enrollment. Restrictions are also listed in thestudent's account on my.uchicago.edu.20         Academic AdvisingAcademic AdvisingOffice of the Dean of Students in the CollegeUpon matriculation, every student is assigned to a professional academic adviser on the staff of the dean ofstudents. The primary responsibility of advisers is to support students as they address the range of decisions theywill make during college. Advisers help students discover how to pursue their interests within the curricularrequirements of the College and plan an appropriate program of study leading to a degree in their selectedmajor. Students should direct questions about courses and programs of study and about University rules andregulations to their College advisers. Advisers are also a good first source of assistance with personal problems.Every effort is made to keep students with the same adviser throughout their time in the College, although forvarious reasons students are sometimes reassigned to a different adviser within the office.College advisers can provide students with information about the full range of educational opportunitiesavailable in the University community and can assist students in preparing for careers and graduate study.Information about study abroad, fellowships and scholarships, and careers (health professions, law, business) isprovided by advisers with expertise in those areas.Students can view a list of the staff members (http://college.uchicago.edu/about/college-staff-directory) of the office of the dean of students in the College, and the office can be reached by writingcollegeadvising@uchicago.edu.The Collegiate DivisionsThe masters of the Collegiate Divisions (Biological Sciences, Humanities, New Collegiate Division, PhysicalSciences, Social Sciences) have curricular and staffing responsibilities for their divisions. The senior advisersof the divisions, assisted by faculty committees, rule on interpretations of the general education requirementsin response to questions from advisers or students. Lists of the masters and divisional administrators oradministrative assistants for all of the Collegiate Divisions are available at college.uchicago.edu/about-college/collegiate-divisions.Major ProgramsStudents typically select a major no later than the end of their second year, often sooner. This decisionshould be discussed with the student's College Adviser. After students choose a major, they should have regularcontact with the appropriate director of undergraduate studies and other counselors in their department.Among the topics that students discuss with counselors are questions about requirements, study and researchopportunities, graduate school and career planning, and departmental events, both social and academic. Someprograms of study admit students on the basis of an application procedure. Before officially declaring an intentto pursue such a major, a student must receive consent from the department. Contact information is available atthe beginning and end of each program of study description in this catalog.Minor ProgramsStudents who elect to pursue a minor program should meet with the appropriate director of undergraduatestudies to declare their intention. Before the end of Spring Quarter of their third year, students must submit totheir College adviser the director's approval for the minor on a form obtained from the adviser. Students choosecourses to meet the requirements of the minor in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies.2018-2019 The College            21Academic IntegrityAs students and faculty of the University of Chicago, we all belong to an academic community with highscholarly standards of which we are justly proud. Our community also holds certain fundamental ethicalprinciples to which we are equally deeply committed. We believe it is contrary to justice, to academic integrity,and to the spirit of intellectual inquiry to submit the statements or ideas or work of others as one's own. Todo so is plagiarism or cheating, offenses punishable under the University's disciplinary system. Because theseoffenses undercut the distinctive moral and intellectual character of the University, we take them very seriously;punishments for committing them may range up to permanent expulsion from the University of Chicago. TheCollege, therefore, expects that you will properly acknowledge your use of another's ideas, whether that useis by direct quotation or by paraphrase, however loose. In particular, if you consult any written source andeither directly or indirectly use what you find in that source in your own work, you must identify the author,title, and page number. If you have any doubts about what constitutes "use," consult your instructor and visitcollege.uchicago.edu/policies-regulations/academic-integrity-student-conduct.22         Examination CreditExamination CreditIn order to earn a degree from the College of the University of Chicago, a student must obtain credit for atleast forty-two quarter courses (4200 units), distributed among general education requirements, major programrequirements, and electives, as described in the section on the curriculum at the front of this publication. Forstudents matriculating in Autumn 2017 or later, of the 4200 units, 3800 units of credit must be earned by courseenrollment, i.e., not credit by examination.All students receive credit toward their degrees by taking courses in the College. In addition, studentsmay receive credit and/or satisfy College requirements in the following ways: by placement test; by AdvancedPlacement (AP) examinations; by accreditation examination; by International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme; andby credit transferred from another institution. The limits and conditions placed on credit earned in these variousways are explained in the following section and on the Transfer Credit page. A student must be in residenceat the University of Chicago for at least six quarters and must successfully complete a minimum of eighteencourses (1800 units) while in residence. More than half of the requirements for a major or minor must be met byregistering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.Placement TestsPlacement tests serve to adapt the needs and backgrounds of individual students to the College curriculum.They place entering students at the proper level of study in a given subject. On the one hand, placement testsminimize the repetition of subjects already mastered and, on the other, they reduce the possibility that studentsmight begin their programs with courses for which they are inadequately prepared. Placement tests measureskill in problem solving as well as general knowledge in a subject field. Students who have some background inthe areas being tested are urged to review it, but incoming students without such knowledge are not expected toacquire it over the summer preceding entrance.Placement tests may be taken only at the time of matriculation and each test may be taken only once.Information that describes these tests is sent to incoming first-year and transfer students.Chemistry Placement TestStudents who wish to enroll in chemistry must take the online chemistry placement test along with theMathematics Placement Test (or they must have earned a score of 5 on the AP Chemistry exam).Economics Placement TestStudents who wish to begin their economics major with "

Programs qualifyingstudents for the degrees of BS require more emphasis in the physical sciences, while the BS in mathematics withspecialization in economics has its own set of specialized courses with more electives in economics in place ofelectives in the physical sciences. All degree programs, whether qualifying students for a degree in mathematicsor in applied mathematics, require fulfillment of the College's general education requirements. The generaleducation sequence in the physical sciences must be selected from either first-year chemistry or first-year physics.Except for the BS in mathematics with specialization in economics, each degree requires at least five coursesoutside mathematics (detailed descriptions follow for each degree). These courses must be within the PhysicalSciences Collegiate Division (PSCD) or from Computational Neuroscience (CPNS). One of these courses mustcomplete the three-quarter sequence in basic chemistry or basic physics. At least two of these courses must befrom a single department and all must be chosen from among Astronomy (20000 or above), Chemistry, ComputerScience (not including 10100, 10200, 11000, 11100, or 11200), Physics (12000s or above), Geophysical Sciences,Statistics (22000 or above), CPNS, or Molecular Engineering. Graduate courses from these departments mayalso be used to fulfill these requirements. No courses from the Financial Mathematics program may be used inany of the undergraduate degree programs in mathematics. Please note in particular the different requirementsoutside of mathematics described below in the degree program for the BS in mathematics with specialization ineconomics.Degree Programs in MathematicsStudents who are majoring in mathematics are required to complete: a 10000-level sequence in calculus(or to demonstrate equivalent competence on the calculus accreditation examination); either 0.

The late University of Chicago professor and Nobel laureate SubrahmanyanChandrasekhar, who predicted the existence of black holes based on theoretical considerations, described wellthe importance of science in our lives when he said, "Science is a perception of the world around us. Science is aplace where what you find in nature pleases you."Under the designation PHSC, the Physical Sciences Collegiate Division offers several sequences of coursesfrom the Astronomy and Astrophysics, Chemistry, Geophysical Sciences, and Physics departments, tailored toprovide an interesting and useful education for non-scientists in their goal of satisfying their general educationrequirement in the physical sciences. The goal of general education in the physical sciences is to engender inthe student the ability to understand and assess our understanding of the physical world. One can argue thatthe fundamental tenet of liberal education at the University of Chicago is to cultivate an appreciation for criticalinquiry and the basis for judgement. The physical sciences contribute to this mission in teaching the principlesof experimentation, observation, and the principles of scientific inquiry. Chemistry and physics are advancedthrough laboratory experiments that study the structure of nature and build models which we extrapolate fromthose observations. Astronomy and geophysical sciences develop methods to make inferences about the worldaround us based on observations which cannot always be recreated in a laboratory.While the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science Departments do not offer PHSC courses, thesesubjects are strongly connected to the physical sciences. Mathematics is the language of science and the onlyknown way to make quantitative assessments about the experiments. Statistics teaches us how to interpretexperimental results and how to assess a level of confidence in the conclusions derived from them, whilecomputer science enables us to analyze large and complex data and simulate physical processes whoseproperties cannot be determined mathematically. The techniques developed and applied to scientific inquiryprovide valuable tools to the basis of inquiry in any field, and indeed in our lives in general.Students are required to take at least two courses in the physical sciences to satisfy the general educationrequirement. This requirement may be met by taking an introductory sequence in Chemistry, Geosciences, orPhysics, or by taking any acceptable pairing of Physical Sciences (PHSC) courses, which generally have a broaderfocus than the disciplinary sequences. It is strongly recommended that the general education sequence in thephysical sciences be completed in the first two years.General Education Sequences for Science MajorsThe following introductory sequences may be used to satisfy the general education requirement in thephysical sciences for all students, although these tend to be taken by sciences majors or by students who have aparticular need for science (namely, premeds).

The decisionto grant credit is reported at the end of the first year in residence and units of credit awarded appear on thestudent’s official academic record.While AP scores alone are sometimes used to establish placement or to confer credit, satisfactoryperformance on the College’s own placement tests may supplement AP scores and lead to additional credit.The following chart shows how AP credit is automatically awarded. For further information on how creditmay be used toward individual degree programs, a student should consult his or her College adviser. For moreinformation on how AP credit may be used to meet major requirements, refer to the major requirements listedunder “Programs of Study” in this catalog.NOTE: For students matriculating in Autumn 2017 or later, at least 3800 units of credit must be earned bycourse enrollment, i.e., not credit by examination. For students matriculating in Autumn 2018 or later, only scoresof 5 on approved tests will confer language competency.Students who matriculated prior to 2017 should refer to the Advanced Placement credit table in the catalog oftheir year of matriculation for earlier guidelines regarding AP credit.

Uponcompletion of the BA at the end of the fourth year, the students continue to be registered as graduate students forthree contiguous quarters in the second year of the Middle Eastern Studies program.Qualifications and EligibilityPermission to receive both the BA in a major field and the MA in Middle Eastern Studies is not an automaticperquisite of undergraduate study at Chicago. It is a privilege extended only to those undergraduate studentswho have demonstrated, in their undergraduate work, a record of uncommon excellence and who are sufficientlyadvanced in the fulfillment of the undergraduate degree requirements. The academic demands on these studentsare significant, and applicants are carefully reviewed in the context of both their undergraduate major and themaster’s degree requirements.Applicants should have a minimum GPA for their undergraduate work comparable to that required forhonors in their major and have completed the College general education requirements as well as 39 courses,including some graduate-level courses.Furthermore, applicants are required to have completed by the end of their third year:•one year (three courses) of a Middle Eastern language, and•three courses related to Middle Eastern studiesApplicants who are pursuing an undergraduate major that requires a BA thesis will be permitted to registerfor the BA thesis workshop as a fourth course during the fourth year of undergraduate studies.In addition to a distinguished record of achievement during their time in the College, applicants mustconvincingly demonstrate that they will be able to complete all requirements for the two degrees by the endof the allotted six quarters of full-time residence. For this purpose, potential applicants should meet withtheir adviser in the College and fill out a BA/MA Worksheet. The adviser’s signature certifies that prospectiveapplicants are far enough along in their College program to complete the course requirements for both degreeswithin five years.Time LimitsThis course of study prolongs registration at the University to five years. Students are expected to completethe BA requirements at the end of the fourth year in the College to be allowed to continue into the second year ofthe MA program and receive their BA at the end of the fourth year in the College.Students enrolled in the second year of the Middle Eastern Studies program as part of this BA/MA programwill be enrolled as any other students in the second year of the Middle Eastern Studies program and subject tothe same rules and requirements for graduation.Registration, Tuition, and Financial AidTo receive both the BA in an undergraduate discipline and MA in Middle Eastern Studies requires that thelast three quarters of the regular undergraduate course of study be spent in full-time (three courses per quarter)registration status in the Middle Eastern Studies program and an additional three quarters of registration inthe Middle Eastern Studies program. For each of the six quarters in which students are registered in the MAprogram, the students are charged the graduate tuition rate, which is somewhat higher than the undergraduatetuition rate.Students are not eligible for financial assistance from the Social Sciences or Humanities Division in the firstyear of the MA program (their fourth year in the College). Therefore, students admitted to this program shouldconsult the College Aid Office to determine if their financial aid will be affected. In the second year of the MAprogram, students are eligible for financial aid from the Social Sciences or Humanities Division on the sameterms as any other second-year graduate student in the Middle Eastern Studies program.A minimum of six quarters of undergraduate residence in the College is required, including the threequarters of registration of the first year in the Middle Eastern Studies program.2018-2019 The College            867Courses and RequirementsNo more than three graduate-level courses taken in the fourth year in the College may be double-counted;that is, applied to both the College requirements and the MA requirements. Graduate courses taken during thesecond or third year in the College may not be counted toward the BA/MA in Middle Eastern Studies. Onceadmitted to the BA/MA program, students will be required to complete the core course requirements of the MAdegree.During their fourth year in the College (first year of the MA program), students retain their undergraduateprivilege of registering for four courses per quarter. However, students are encouraged to take no more thanthree, if possible. During the second year of the MA program, students must follow MA rules, which restrictenrollment to three courses per quarter. The MA program requires a master’s thesis which must be planned,researched, and written, and this requires a significant amount of time.Application ProceduresThird-year students in the College who have been certified by the BA/MA adviser that they are prepared topursue both the BA and MA degrees in Middle Eastern Studies in five years should obtain a graduate programapplication. Depending on the undergraduate major of the student, the graduate application should be obtainedfrom either the Dean of Students Office in the Social Sciences (Foster 103) or Dean of Students office in theHumanities (Walker 111). The application should be completed, signed, and returned to the same office with allthe necessary supporting documents by February 1.The following documents must be on file with the divisional Dean of Students Office before the applicationwill be reviewed:1.the application2.two letters of recommendation3.a writing sample4.official transcript(s)5.BA/MA Worksheet: Filled out and signed by the College adviser6.BA/MA Form: Top portion filled outApplicants are not required to pay the application fee nor are they required to sit for the GraduateRecord Examination. Applicants will be interviewed by the Center for Middle Eastern Studies deputy directorfor academic programs. These conversations will focus on the program’s requirements and the applicant’squalifications and objectives.Admissions decisions are usually not released before College preregistration for the following year takesplace. Admissions committees often wish to see Winter Quarter grades before making decisions. Thus, applicantsshould preregister for the coming academic year as any other undergraduate student.Other Guidelines•Students who begin work towards the MA degree in Middle Eastern Studies and then leave theUniversity without completing the program will not be allowed to complete the MA at a later date.•Once a student has begun to pursue both the BA and the MA degree, a leave of absence is not normallypossible. Students who find that they must take a leave of absence for a medical or family emergency duringthis period must obtain the approval of the dean of students of the applicable graduate division as well asthe dean of students in the College.ContactFor more information, please contact Paul Walker, Deputy Director for Academic Programs(pwalker@uchicago.edu; 773.702.4619).868         Joint BA/MPP in Public Policy Studies (Harris)Joint BA/MPP in PublicPolicy Studies (Harris)The University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy offers students an opportunity to begintheir professional training in public policy while still in the College, leading to the awarding of a four-yearundergraduate degree in their declared major and a two-year master of public policy (MPP) degree after fiveyears of studies at the University of Chicago.The MPP is a professional degree program designed for students who wish to gain rigorous training in publicpolicy skills and issues. The core curriculum draws on a variety of disciplines and fields, including economics,statistics, sociology, political science, political economy, organizational theory, and program evaluation. Theseareas provide a foundation in critical analysis, reflecting Harris Public Policy's belief that mastering quantitativeand analytical skills prepares students to be effective public policy leaders.Program RequirementsStudents selected to participate in the joint degree program must meet all normal BA requirements for theirparticular field of study, as well as all general education requirements. In addition, joint degree students in theBA/MPP program must satisfy the following criteria:1.Students are encouraged to complete all general education and BA requirements in their third yearin the College before beginning the MPP degree in the fourth year. Students with two or fewer coursesremaining in the BA, excluding any thesis, research, or final paper requirements, are eligible for admissionwith approval from the Harris Department of Academic and Student Affairs. The remaining courses can bedouble-counted toward the BA and MPP, but courses must be graduate level courses (courses numbered30000 or above). Students must complete all BA requirements before beginning the fifth year.2.Applicants are expected to have a GPA of 3.25 or higher.3.All majors are strongly encouraged to apply.4.Students must have completed at least one course, at any level, in at least two of the following threeareas at the College: microeconomics, statistics, or calculus.

The courses emphasize texts rather than surveysas a way of getting at the ideas, cultural patterns, and social pressures that frame the understanding of eventsand institutions within a civilization. And they seek to explore a civilization as an integrated entity, capable ofdeveloping and evolving meanings that inform the lives of its citizens.Unless otherwise specified, courses should be taken in sequence. Note the prerequisites, if any, included inthe course description of each sequence. Some civilization sequences are two-quarter sequences; others are three-quarter sequences. Students may meet a two-quarter civilization requirement with two courses from a three-quarter sequence.Because civilization studies sequences offer an integrated, coherent approach to the study of a civilization,students cannot change sequences. Students can neither combine courses from a civilization sequence witha freestanding course nor combine various freestanding courses to create a civilization studies sequence.Students who wish to use such combinations are seldom granted approval to their petitions, including petitionsfrom students with curricular and scheduling conflicts who have postponed meeting the civilization studiesrequirement until their third or fourth year in the College.Civilization Studies Courses on Campus0-0 HonorsGeneral Chemistry, they may take 0 Honors General Chemistrysequence, they may take 0 Honors General Chemistry sequence, they may take0-12200 Honors GeneralChemistry I-II also satisfy this requirement.

We encourage students to take theirelective courses across the four areas of Comparative Human Development, given the department's commitmentto transdisciplinary scholarship. All CHDV course numbers are labeled to describe the areas in which they aremost closely aligned. The four areas are the following:1.Comparative Behavioral Biology: includes courses on the biopsychology of attachment; evolutionarysocial psychology; evolution of parenting; biological psychology; primate behavior and ecology; behavioralendocrinology.2.Life Course Development: includes courses on social and psychological development through the lifecourse, including courses on childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and aging; education and development;introduction to language development; the role of early experience in development; sexual and genderidentity; the study of lives and families in social and cultural context.3.Culture and Community: includes courses on cultural psychology; psychological anthropology; socialpsychology; cross-cultural child development; language, culture, and thought; language socialization;education in ethnic and cultural context; psychiatric and psychodynamic anthropology; memory andculture.4.Mental Health and Personality: includes courses on personality theory and research; social and culturalfoundations of mental and physical health; modern psychotherapies and their supporting institutions;psychology of well-being; conflict understanding and resolution; core concepts and current directions inpsychopathology; emotion, mind, and rationality; body image in health and disorder; advanced concepts inpsychoanalysis.PetitionsStudent petitions will be accepted only in very limited circumstances to request that courses not taughtor cross-listed in CHDV count toward CHDV major requirements. These limited circumstances may include arelevant course offered during study abroad if a CHDV course is not available. Students may petition for onerelevant course per quarter of study abroad to count toward the CHD major, but only one, barring unusualcircumstances. Only university-level courses credited by the University of Chicago or study abroad may bepetitioned for CHDV requirements; no other form of credit (including Advanced Placement) is allowed.

Students who matriculated prior toAutumn 2017 may choose to follow these updated requirements; otherwise, they should consult the archivedcatalog from their year of matriculation (or, at their option, any later year) for the degree requirements inStatistics. All students who matriculated in Autumn 2017 or later should follow the updated requirementsdescribed below.Every candidate must obtain approval of his or her course program from the Departmental Adviser forMajors. Students majoring in Statistics should meet the general education requirement in mathematical scienceswith courses in calculus. The major program includes four additional prescribed mathematics courses, fourprescribed statistics courses, and two prescribed computer science courses. Students are advised to completethe four mathematics courses by the end of their third year. Additional requirements include four approvedelective courses in Statistics. The BS also requires an additional prescribed mathematics course and an approved,coherent, three-quarter sequence at the 20000 level in a field to which statistics can be applied. Students whoare majoring in Statistics must receive quality grades of at least C+ in both 0 Statistical Models and Methods,neither of which count toward the major, but which could serve as a prerequiste for courses such as 0 Statistical Models andMethods, 0 Statistical Models and Methods,but not both, may be used as an elective if taken prior to any other courses for which at least 0 Statistical Models and Methods is prerequisite.

To havenon–University of Chicago courses considered for transfer credit, students must follow these steps:1.Submit a petition (http://petition.uchicago.edu) to the Office of the Dean of Students inthe College, including course descriptions and/or syllabi, units of credit, and the name of theinstitution where courses will be taken. This information should be submitted online well inadvance of taking the course. (Students with inactive logins should contact College Advising(collegeadvising@uchicago.edu) for a PDF version of the petition form.)2.If approved by the College, the student may seek additional approval for use of that pre-evaluated credit toward major/minor/general education requirements. Instructions will be providedif/when the initial petition is approved. Note that approval is not guaranteed and should be sought asearly as possible.3.Have an official transcript sent to their College adviser upon completion of the course work.Note: Students should petition for approval well in advance of the start date of the desired courses. Students submittingpetitions without a sufficient window should not expect to receive a final decision before the courses begin, especially if theyhope to use the course toward a particular requirement.For students participating in a University of Chicago–sponsored direct enrollment program:These students do not need to petition the College Dean of Students office and should instead speak to theirprogram director in Study Abroad about the appropriate next steps.For transfer students:See Transfer Students below.College Courses Taken Prior to MatriculationCourses taken during high school:Students should not petition until they determine (in their second year or later) that they will need thecredit. Students may petition earlier if previous course work may serve as a prerequisite for an Universityof Chicago course. The petition (http://petition.uchicago.edu) must be submitted to the Office of the Deanof Students in the College, including course descriptions and/or syllabi, units of credit, and the name of theinstitution where courses were taken. These restrictions also apply to courses completed at the University ofChicago prior to matriculation.To be considered for credit, petitions must comply with the preceding regulations and the followingrestrictions:•Courses may not have counted toward high school graduation requirements.•Credit for science and calculus courses is not accepted; students should take the appropriateplacement or accreditation exams at the time of matriculation.•Approved credit may only be used as general elective credit. Credit will not be awarded forgeneral education requirements or foreign language courses.•Courses must have been offered to a cohort that included undergraduate students. Coursestaught specifically for high school student programs will not transfer.Undergraduate courses taught in the College at the University of Chicago are exempt from these restrictions.28         Transfer CreditCourses taken in the summer prior to matriculation:Admitted students are not allowed to register for University of Chicago courses in the summer prior tomatriculation. It is important that admitted students first learn about curricular issues and academic expectationsalongside their classmates during Orientation Week.Admitted students who take college-level courses at another institution may submit a petition (http://petition.uchicago.edu) for transfer credit after matriculation. They should discuss the process with their Collegeadviser during first-year advising meetings. The transfer credit petition will be evaluated based on all of theabove criteria. Credit will be awarded for general elective credit only.Early College ProgramsStudents who have attended what are commonly known as early college programs (i.e., programs in anundergraduate setting attended in lieu of one or more years of high school) will fall into one of two categories:•Students who may apply as traditional first-year students. In this case, any credit earned in the earlycollege program will be subject to the regulations described above in Courses taken during high school, or•Students who must apply to the College as transfer students. If accepted these students will be held to thestandards described in the Transfer Students section below. It is essential to note that all students acceptedas transfer admits will be subject to the same expectations, including a shorter timeline for completing theircollege education.Students from a number of early college programs, including Bard High School Early College and TAMSat North Texas, are considered by the University of Chicago to be first-year applicants, which means their creditwill be subject to the Courses taken during high school regulations. Additionally, any courses that were taken tofulfill high school graduation requirements will not be accepted for credit under any circumstances.Students should contact College Admissions (collegeadmissions@uchicago.edu) for clarification of theirentry status.Transfer StudentsAfter admitted transfer students have committed to attending University of Chicago, they receiveinformation from the Admissions Office about how to submit the materials necessary for an evaluation of theirprevious college course work. Students must also have their previous institution send a final, official transcriptto the Admissions Office. These materials should be submitted no later than June 15. Transfer evaluations cannotbe completed before a student has accepted an offer of admission. Note that transfer credit does not count toward theUniversity of Chicago GPA, nor do the grades appear on the University of Chicago transcript. Students may notreceive more than 1200 units of transfer credit for one academic year of work, nor may they receive more than400 units of credit for one summer of study.The evaluation of transfer credit is based on the guidelines and restrictions listed in the previoussection.Note the following restrictions in particular:•Credit for calculus and pre-calculus is not accepted. Credit for calculus will be granted only byCollege accreditation or AP exam, or on the basis of completion of a higher-level course.•Depending on the student’s major and on the level of work to be evaluated, credit for somecourses in other sciences may also be subject to examination.•The restrictions on college course work taken during high school (outlined in the previoussection) apply to all undergraduate students.•Completion of an approved beginning-level language sequence at a different institution doesn'tsatisfy the language competency requirement; ordinarily, it would qualify the student to take an on-campus competency exam.Residency Requirements and Enrollment Limits for Transfer StudentsA transfer student must be in residence as a degree-seeking student in the College for at least six quarters(excluding summers) and successfully complete a minimum of 18 courses (1800 units) while in residence. Morethan half of the requirements for a major and/or minor must be met by registering for courses bearing Universityof Chicago course numbers. Course credit approved to transfer will count toward the 3800-unit credit minimumstudents are required to earn via course enrollment.The Dean of Students in the College expects all students to complete their degrees in a timely fashion,ordinarily within 12 quarters. This expectation will be tailored for transfer students who enter the College witha substantial number of credits. Based on the transfer evaluation, transfer students will be assigned a time framein which they are expected to complete their requirements—typically six or nine quarters. Transfer students maypetition the Dean of Students in the College for one additional quarter of study if academically necessary for theundergraduate degree. Transfer students may not register beyond their allotted quarters without the permissionof the Dean of Students in the College.2018-2019 The College            29After matriculation in the College, transfer students may not earn additional credits from schools other thanthe University of Chicago. Faculty-led study abroad programs sponsored by the College may be used to meetboth the residency and course requirements. Transfer students will be allowed to participate in direct enrollmentstudy abroad programs affiliated with the College, but these courses cannot be used to satisfy the residencyrequirement.30         ArtsArtsThe general education requirement in the arts provides an introduction to methods for analyzing,comprehending, and appreciating works of dramatic, musical, or visual art by examining their formalvocabularies and how these vocabularies are used to create meaning. This is accomplished either by the intensivestudy of selected masterpieces or by producing original works.The courses that satisfy this requirement, listed below, come from a variety of departments and are designednot as specialized introductions to one single field or creative practice, but instead are expressly designed tobroadly investigate the arts through study and practice. For that reason, only these courses can be used to satisfythe general education requirement in the arts. Substitutes, including upper-level electives, will not be approved.General Education Course Options0. Beginning Elementary Spanish III. 100 Units.This course expands on the material presented in 0.

The usual prerequisiteis consent of instructor or any 10000-level course in art history or visual arts. The 20000-level art history coursesinvestigate the arts of specific periods and places from a variety of perspectives. Some courses embrace largebodies of material defined by national culture; others follow developments in style, iconography, and patronageas they affect works in selected media.Major in Art HistoryThe BA in art history furnishes students with a broad knowledge of art, including architecture, even asit provides an opportunity for the complementary, intensive study of an area of special interest. The basiccomponents of the concentration are: a Special Field, devised in consultation with departmental instructors andthe Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS); a distribution of courses outside the special field; at least tworesearch papers in art history (emerging from ordinary course work in the department); and a third-year seminaron art-historical methods and issues. Fourth-year students who wish to pursue honors in the major conductindependent research on a topic of their own devising, producing a BA Paper with the guidance of a facultymember and a graduate preceptor.Program RequirementsBeginning with the Class of 2020, art history majors will follow the requirements outlined below. Students in theClass of 2019 have the option of adhering to the new or to the old requirements. They should meet with the Director ofUndergraduate Studies to address their options and any questions or concerns.All art history majors are expected take at least one (1) course in art history at the 10000-level to fulfilltheir general education requirement in the arts. Although general education courses do not count for the major,2018-2019 The College            111they are useful preliminaries to advanced work. It is, therefore, strongly recommended that students take such acourse as early as possible in their undergraduate careers. Note: Students who have formally declared the majorin art history are guaranteed admission to 10000-level courses by notifying the instructor in advance.The Standard CurriculumThe standard formula for requirements in the major goes by the sobriquet “4-3-2-1.” All art history majorsmust complete the following:•Four (4) courses at the 20000-level to meet a distribution requirement within the department. Thesecourses shall be selected in consultation with the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Courses should beselected for maximal geographical, chronological, cultural, and methodological diversity, and for minimaloverlap with the Special Field.•Three (3) courses at the 20000-level in a Special Field. Students develop the Special Field inconsultation with departmental instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies. Because SpecialFields reflect the interests of individual students, they range widely in topic, approach, and scope. Readingcourses with art history faculty may be used to pursue specific questions within a Special Field. For more onthe Special Field, seeSpecial Field below.•Two (2) courses at the 20000-level as free electives. Any art history courses at the 20000-level maysatisfy this requirement. Courses outside the Department of Art History that relate directly to the SpecialField are eligible to meet this requirement by petition to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.•"

DoVA's faculty consists of a core of artists and other humanists interested in making and thinkingabout art. Students who major in visual arts take an individually arranged program of studio, lecture, andseminar courses that may include some courses outside the Humanities Collegiate Division. The program seeksto foster understanding of art from several perspectives: the practice and intention of the creator, the visualconventions employed, and the perception and critical reception of the audience. In addition to work in thestudio, these aims may require study of many other subjects, including but not limited to art history, intellectualhistory, criticism, and aesthetics.All students take 0 Visual Language: On Time and Space in the first two years of their studies. After completingone of these general education courses but no later than Winter Quarter of their third year, students meet withthe Director of Undergraduate Studies to plan the rest of their program. At least six of the courses beyond thegeneral education requirement in the arts must be drawn from the second level of studio-based offerings (studioart courses numbered 21000 and above). Please note that only courses that are primarily focused on art makingcan be applied toward this requirement. Students may take up to two studio-based independent study courses(0Visual Language: On Time and Space0Visual Language: On Time and Space0 Visual Language: On Time andSpace), and five are drawn from visual arts studio courses numbered 21000 to 29700, chosen in consultation with2018-2019 The College            809the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

Spacetravel is enabled by the ingestion of enormous quantities of a geriatric spice a messianic figure auspiciouslylearns to manipulate. A drug trip?! Among popular genres, science fiction is the riskiest conceptually and amongthe trickiest to master. The difference between an amazing idea and a rotten story is often slim. What makesgood sci-fi work? And how best to write it? Let's put on our gravity boots and solar visors and see what we candiscover. In this course, you'll read some novels (by Frank Herbert, Alfred Bester, and Ursula K. LeGuin), poetry(by Andrew Joron), a graphic novel (by Chris Ware), and screenplays (by Damon Lindelof, and Stanley Kubrick& Arthur C. Clarke).

Reading as a Writer: Crime and Story. 100 Units.If prostitution is the earliest profession, then crime is probably the earliest narrative engine. Crime has alwaysbeen a driving force behind story, a vehicle not only of plot but of human psychology, social exploration,philosophical investigation, and just plain old suspense. There's something about the darker side of humannature that invites explorations of characters pushed to their extremes. Through analyzing the writing techniquesand processes-such as point of view, scene, setting, voice, narrative structure and research methodologies-of suchwriters and poets as Raymond Chandler, Patricia Highsmith, Walter Mosley, Joyce Carol Oates, Denis Johnson,Carolyn Forché, CK Williams, Nami Mun, James Ellroy, and Richard Price among others, students will examinehow elements of crime in story can be transformed beyond simple genre. By examining writers' choices, studentswill explore how they may use these techniques to develop such mechanics of writing as point of view, poetics,dramatic movement and narrative structure in their own work.Instructor(s): Augustus Rose Terms Offered: WinterPrerequisite(s): Open bid through classes.uchicago.edu.

We study how painting, photography,writing, film, song, and other media have allowed for new forms of knowledge, expression, and experience—but have also been seen as ethically dangerous or politically disruptive. The sequence traces philosophical andaesthetic debates about media from antiquity to the present in various cultural contexts; we examine discussionsof image, text, and sound in Plato, Shakespeare, Nietzsche, W. E. B. Du Bois, Alfred Hitchcock, Toni Morrison,and recent critical theory. Throughout, we develop attention to the “aesthetics” of media by closely studying howspecific aspects of complex works of art and literature lead audiences to think and feel in particular ways.0.

ANTH 2142,"8, 0 Ethnographic Methods, 0Ethnographic Methods0. Ethnographic Methods. 100 Units.This is a course on how to do ethnographic research. While recent decades have seen scholars rightfully insiston the artistic and inherently personal quality of 'doing' and 'writing' ethnography, the course aims to illuminatethe regulating structures of thought and practice underpinning every piece of original ethnographic work. Thecourse is both a reading and a research workshop. As a reading workshop, it seeks to enable students to readethnography like ethnographers: identifying and learning from the inner workings of the research project at theheart of each ethnographic text. As a research workshop, the course progressively leads students to constructand implement a research project of their own. Students will methodically enact the physical techniques andanalytic practices emerging from their reading of ethnography. Throughout the course, we will grapple withthe challenges facing an ethnographic researcher, and identify the building blocks of an ethnographic project.In this effort, we will focus on the posing of a research question; the formulation of conceptual frameworks;constructing a statement of problem; actors and informants; the semiotics and pragmatics of interviewing;analysis of interactions qua participant-observer, and historical approaches in ethnography. Students will alsoexperiment with forms of non-verbal visual representation.Instructor(s): Escobar Gonzalez, Ines Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): Preference given to third-year anthropology majors, others by consent only94         Anthropology8.

Zaragoza Terms Offered: Autumn SpringPrerequisite(s): 6. Introduction to Social Neuroscience. 100 Units.This course on social neuroscience addresses a timely topic in the fields of medicine, psychology, and theneurosciences. Specifically, a key challenge in the study of the brain and its effects on health and behavior residesnot only in determining how one's mental states and processes map onto their own patterns of brain activity butalso how this activity is modulated by shared representations with other individuals through various neural,hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms. These are questions that fall within the field of social neuroscience- the study of the neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying the superorganismal structuresand processes that define social species. When social neuroscience was first proposed a quarter century ago,attention had to be given to address why the notion of a "social neuroscience" was not an oxymoron and toarticulate a set of principles (the doctrine of multilevel analysis) that justified attention to super- organismalstructures (e.g., a pair bond, marriage, salutary relationship) in the analysis of the function of the nervous systemand brain. This was prior to the recognition of the importance of epigenetics and prior to the sophisticated meansof probing the neural aspects of shared representations, embodied cognition, and the social brain in normal,waking humans and animals that exist today. Indeed, genes were still thought to be strong if not invariantdeterminants of human illness, phenotypes and behavior. So where does social neuroscience now fit withinmedicine and the science of brain, mind, and behavior? That is the focus of the course.Instructor(s): S.

BIOS 1511,"5. Cancer Biology: How Good Cells Go Bad. 100 Units.This lecture/discussion course examines the multi-step process by which normal cells become malignant cancercells. Topics include how defects in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis can occur incancer cells, as well as how cancer cells can acquire the ability to attract blood vessels (angiogenesis) and toinvade other organ systems (metastasis). We emphasize the study of signal transduction pathways and how theyare altered in cancer cells. The concept of genes that cause cancer (oncogenes) and genes that deter cancer (tumorsuppressor genes) is discussed. New disease treatments that target specific molecular defects within cancer cellsare reviewed.Instructor(s): M. Villereal Terms Offered: Spring,WinterPrerequisite(s): "

The Biological Nature of Psychological Problems. 100 Units.This course is based on the strong assumption that psychology is a biological science, albeit with elementsof the social sciences. The course uses a combination of lectures and classroom discussion of primary andsecondary source readings assigned for each class meeting. It presents a strong biological science perspectiveon individual differences in emotions, motivations, and cognitions that cause distress or interfere withadaptive life functioning, but does so in a non-stigmatizing manner. The course begins with a description anddiscussion of the nature of psychological problems. The course will survey what is known about the genetic,environmental, and epigenetic bases of such problems and the methods used to study genetic influences andgene-environment interactions. Next, students will review what is currently known about the neural and otherbiological mechanisms involved in maladaptive individual difference in emotion, motivation, and cognitiveprocesses, with discussion of the methods of studying such mechanisms in humans and nonhumans. The prosand cons of the medical model of 'mental illness' will be discussed as the major contrast with the natural scienceview advocated by the instructor.Instructor(s): B.

The Center for Gender Studies recognizes two main paths by which students might developan undergraduate concentration. Path A is for students whose central interest lies in the interdisciplinary studyof gender and sexuality; it is designed to provide students with a range of conceptual and historical resourcesto pursue such study with creativity and rigor. Path B is for students whose interest in gender and sexuality isprimarily organized around a specific other discipline or field such as History, English, or Political Science; it isdesigned to provide students with the conceptual and methodological resources to pursue Gender and SexualityStudies within such a field. Within those goals, each path is meant to provide students with the opportunityto design a course of study tailored to their particular interests. Each path consists of one theory course, GNSE10310 Theories of Gender and Sexuality or an approved substitute; a group of ten electives chosen in consultationwith the Director of Undergraduate Studies and the Student Affairs Administrator; a BA Essay seminar forfourth-year students; and a BA paper written under the supervision of an appropriate faculty member.Path A: The course 2-15003.

In addition to the science courses typically taken as part of the general educationrequirements, students are expected to take three courses in science, social sciences, or mathematics beyond theintroductory level. They select these advanced courses according to their special aims, their area of concentration,and the subject of their bachelor's thesis.3. Areas of Concentration. All students in the program determine an area of concentration in theanthropology, ethics, history, philosophy, or sociology of science and medicine. In consultation with the programdirector and their program adviser, students select five courses to constitute this concentration area. For example,some students may be particularly interested in the intellectual and social interactions between changingscientific knowledge and institutions, on the one hand, and evolving social institutions, on the other; a secondgroup may be concerned with either epistemological issues related to the growth of science or moral and politicalproblems attending the employment of technology; and a third group may wish to emphasize the study ofscience as a social or cultural activity.4. Tutorials. Students are required to take two tutorial courses; this is typically done early in their program.With a specific focus that changes each year, these tutorials are small classes (from three to ten students) thatemphasize discussion and writing. An updated list of courses is available in the HIPS office (0–17510An approved sequence that fulfills the biological sciences general education requirement200One of the following sequences:2000–17510), to meet the general education requirementin civilization studies.

They furnish a selective set of materials for a history of scientificpractice. Their other purpose here, however, is to highlight the depth and importance of many problems stillconfronting the world of science today - problems that are cultural as well as scientific, and that demand of us anunderstanding of what science is and how it works.Instructor(s): A.

This three-quarter sequence focuses on the origins and development of science in the West. The twentieth century issometimes called the "golden age" of medicine: a period in which medicine broke free of tradition and combinedwith science to provide powerful new ways of understanding disease, and spectacular new technologies forfighting sickness. Along with amelioration of suffering, however, came new diseases, new medical systems, andnew ways of thinking about the relationship between medical bodies, political bodies, and the nature and scopeof human misery. This course examines some of the many transformations of (predominantly Euro-American)medicine in the twentieth century, looking not only at advances in medical knowledge and technologies, but alsoat the social, political, moral and affective ramifications of new ways of thinking about the promise - and perils -of (bio)medical practice.Instructor(s): Michael Paul Rossi Terms Offered: SpringEquivalent Course(s): 4.

We consider how different types of historical evidence-documentary, oral, and material-can be used to investigate processes of change and transformation inAfrica from the early Iron Age through the emergence of the Atlantic world in the fifteenth century. We willinvestigate state formation in comparative perspective and examine case studies from the Swahili coast,the empires of Ghana and Mali, and Great Zimbabwe. The course also examines the diffusion of Islam,European contact, and the trans-Atlantic slave trade.Instructor(s): E. Osborn Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): 2. Introduction to African Civilization II. 100 Units.The second segment of the African Civilizations sequence uses anthropological perspectives to investigatecolonial and postcolonial encounters in West and East Africa. The course objective is to show that whilecolonialism was brutal and oppressive, it was by no means a unidirectional process of domination in whichEuropeans plundered the African continent and enforced a wholesale adoption of European culture.

We will try to see communismas history and as promise, and to see how this relates to our own desire for social change in our own worlds.We will examine the interaction between Marxism, state power and image culture by focusing on key momentsfrom the entire lifespan of the USSR (1917-1991) and from across the range of media,from graphic art and film totheir reflections in literature and aesthetic theory. In addition to class readings and discussions, we will be ableto engage directly with a vast array of material at exhibits of graphic art (three on campus, three more across thecity) and film series that will be conducted in fall 2011 as part of the city-wide Soviet Arts Experience.Instructor(s): R. Bird Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): 9. Symbolism and Cinema. 100 Units.In his 1896 essay on cinema, Russian writer Maxim Gorky described the new medium to "madness orsymbolism." The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was adominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly)that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and eveninvisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention toFrench and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematicmedium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and themystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relatesto notions of poetic or experimental cinema. Films will represent a broad cross-section of European (and someAmerican) cinema, from Jean Epstein to Sergei Eisenstein and Alexander Dovzhenko, and from Stan Brakhage toAndrei Tarkovsky.Instructor(s): R.

Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units.The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious,political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of textscontinues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course,we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualizetheir ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt.Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient NearEast. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along withrepresentative selections from secondary literature. We will also spend some time thinking about the nature ofbiblical interpretation.Instructor(s): J. Stackert Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): 41, "

It is built upon a three-course civilizations sequence examining the history, culture, and society of theSouth Asian subcontinent through course work, field studies, and direct experience. During the first seven weeksof the quarter, the program will be based in the city of Pune, where students will complete two courses andparticipate in expeditions to nearby cultural and historical sites.Students participating in the Pune Program receive three credits for the civilizations sequence, which meetsthe general education requirement in civilization studies. Students who have already met the civilization studiesrequirement may use these SALC credits as electives. Two South Asian civilizations courses are required forstudents in the major or minor, as described above. The additional civilizations course, 6 South AsianCiv In India-3, can be used toward other SALC requirements. Course titles, units of credit, and grades will beplaced on the Chicago transcript.In addition to the civilizations sequence, students take a fourth course in Hindi during the first sevenweeks of the quarter. For students with no prior experience in South Asian languages, this course is designed tofacilitate their access to local culture and to provide a basis for further study. Advanced sections will be held forthose students with prior course work or experience in Hindi.Pune is a city of some four million inhabitants, situated on the eastern foothills of the Indian western coastalmountains, or ghats, about 100 miles southeast of Mumbai. Labeled famously by India's first prime minister,Jawaharlal Nehru, as "the Oxford and Cambridge of India," it is a major center for Indian art, religion, and highereducation, and an ideal site for cultural immersion.For further details, consult the Study Abroad website (study-abroad.uchicago.edu/programs/pune-south-asian-civilization-india).

HUMA 1910,"0 Humanities WritingSeminars) that introduces the analysis and practice of expert academic writing.All 0. Humanities Writing Seminars. 000 Units.These seminars introduce students to the analysis and practice of expert academic writing. Experts must meetmany familiar standards for successful writing: clear style, logical organization, and persuasive argument. Butbecause they work with specialized knowledge, experts also face particular writing difficulties: they must beclear about complexities and specific about abstractions; they must use uncomplicated organization for verycomplicated ideas; they must create straightforward logic for intricate arguments; they must be concise but notincomplete, direct but not simplistic; they must clarify the obscure but not repeat the obvious; and they mustanticipate the demands of aggressively skeptical readers. The seminars do not repeat or extend the substantivediscussion of the Humanities class; they use the discussions and assignments from those classes as a tool forthe advanced study of writing. We study various methods not only for the construction of sophisticated andwell-structured arguments but also for understanding the complications and limits of those arguments.

Greece and Rome: Texts, Traditions, Transformations I-II-III.This sequence takes the view that traditions are not normative but formative: less stable, pre-given structuresthan self-constituting and self-questioning bodies in perennial transformation. In that light, it offers a groundingin some major texts of the Classical Greek and Latin traditions (read in English translation) as well as theirreception at pivotal moments in modernity. These are texts that have sustained a community of reading andcommentary, debate and critique, ever since their inception, and which continue to resonate through ourinstitutions and values today. In our encounter with them, we will develop the tools to follow our curiosity andread in inquiring and original ways, as well as to defend our readings with respect to the texts. Each quarteris devoted to one or two genres and each includes Greek, Roman, and modern texts that build on each other.Autumn opens with the epic. Winter sees us delve into the paired genres of tragedy and history, examining howeach tries to explain and evaluate societies through distinct modes of narrative and speech. Spring alternatesbetween comedy as a vehicle for subverting, defending, or reconciling ourselves to social norms and the subjectof love in philosophical and literary perspectives.0.

We are all concernedto discover what it means to be an excellent human being and an excellent citizen, and to learn what a justcommunity is. This sequence explores these and related matters, and helps us to examine critically our opinionsabout them. To this end, we read and discuss seminal works of the Western tradition, selected both becausethey illumine the central questions and because, read together, they form a compelling record of human inquiry.Insofar as they force us to consider different and competing ways of asking and answering questions abouthuman and civic excellence, it is impossible for us to approach these writings as detached spectators. Instead, wecome to realize our own indebtedness to our predecessors and are inspired to continue their task of inquiry. Inaddition to providing a deeper appreciation of who we are as human beings and citizens, this sequence aims tocultivate the liberating skills of careful reading, writing, speaking, and listening. 2017–18 readings for this generaleducation sequence consisted of philosophical and literary texts from Ancient Greece to the twentieth century,organized around the themes of "Human Being" and "Citizen."0.

Introduction to the Humanities I-II-III.This sequence emphasizes writing, both as an object of study and as a practice. As we study the texts of thecourse, we pay special attention to questions about how they function as instances of writing: How does thewriting of a text shape the way that we understand it? How does writing shape our sense of what we are doingin the humanities? Such questions about writing will lead to similar questions about language in general: Howis our understanding shaped by the language we use? In the Autumn Quarter, we'll ask these questions withinclassical and familiar norms for using language to argue, to analyze, to be accurate, to be logical, and so on.In Winter and Spring Quarters, we'll move to challenges, and radical criticisms, of these familiar ideas. As topractice: The writing workload of the course is significant. Students will write at least one writing assignmenteach week, and we discuss these assignments in small writing workshops. This is not a course in remedialwriting; rather it is a course for students who are particularly interested in writing or who want to becomeparticularly proficient writers. Readings for the course are selected not thematically or chronologically, but toserve the focus on writing.0.

Reading Cultures: Collection, Travel, Exchange I-II-III.This sequence is devoted to the cultivation of the art of interpretation through the close reading of objects acrossa broad range of times and places, from the Homeric epic to contemporary film, folk tale to museum. In eachcase the goal is to work outward from the textual details—construing the term text generously so as to includeany form of cultural production—and develop insight into the local emergence and global circulation of objectsof interpretation. In the process the sequence explores questions about memory, home, and belonging; aboutthe various historical forms of cultural production, from epic to folk tale, music, film, and novels; about thechallenges of translation to responsible interpretation; about texts as formative sources of human community,inter-personal obligation, and transcendence; about hybridity and the legacy of colonialism; and, of course, aboutthe role of humanistic inquiry in addressing all these questions. The year is divided into three conceptual themesthat allow us to explore the above questions: collection, travel, and exchange. Readings in the past have includedHomer, "The Odyssey"; "The Arabian Nights"; Ovid, "Metamorphoses"; Balzac, "Père Goriot"; Harriet Jacobs,"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl"; Pu Songling, "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio"; Charlie Chaplin,"Modern Times"; Zora Neale Hurston, "Of Mules and Men"; T.

HUMA 2520,"2. Media Ecology: Embodiment & Software. 100 Units.Media ecology examines how the structure and content of our media environments-online and offline, in words,images, sounds, and textures-affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; or alternatively, mediaecology investigates the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patternsand matter. At stake are issues about agency-human or material-and about determinism-how does society orculture interact with or shape its technologies, or vice versa? This course investigates theories of media ecologyby exploring systems of meanings that humans embody (cultural, social, ecological) in conjunction with theemerging field of software studies about the cultural, political, social, and aesthetic impacts of software (e.g.,code, interaction, interface). In our actual and virtual environments, how do we understand performing ourmultiple human embodiments in relation to other bodies (organism or machine) in pursuit of social or politicalgoals?Instructor(s): M.

HM 235,").The PHSC courses in the Physics category are  on Friday of tenth week of Winter Quarter and must besubmitted to  by noon on Friday of the first week of Spring Quarter. No applications will be bedistributed or accepted during spring break. Students are evaluated on the basis of the application statement andprevious performance in the College. Because of the nature of the requirements of the program, no more thantwenty-five students can be admitted per year.Program of StudyThe program in Law, Letters, and Society is concerned with law in civilian and customary legal systems,both historically and contemporaneously. The program is designed to develop the student's analytical skills toenable informed and critical examination of law broadly construed. The organizing premise of the program isthat law is a tool of social organization and control, not simply an expression of will or aspiration, and that itis best understood by careful study of both rhetorical artifacts and empirical consequences of its application.Program requirements are constructed to support the organizing premise, and, because of the nature of therequirements, transfer students are not eligible to register as Law, Letters, and Society majors.The program requires course work in three areas, although there is a reasonably broad latitude bothexpected and permitted in satisfaction of the distributional requirement. There is a substantial writingrequirement for all majors; majors are expected to produce substantial written work (sometimes called "the BAPaper") under the close supervision of a faculty member whose area of scholarly concern is related to the broadobjectives of the program.Program RequirementsCourse work is required in three areas. After successfully completing the Introductory Course, studentsmust take two courses in Letters and two courses in Society. In addition, students must complete six othercourses that, while not necessarily offered or listed formally under either rubric, are substantively supportive ofthe topics, areas, skills, or concerns of the two areas. Courses satisfying the additional requirement are identifiedon a quarterly basis, and final approval of additional required course work is made by consultation between thestudent and the program chairman.The Introductory CourseThe Introductory Course establishes the intellectual moorings of the program. The importance of theIntroductory Course lies not in its content (indeed, its precise focus and scope may be different from time to time)but on its approach to the nature of law.

The Big Bang. 100 Units.The Big Bang model describes the Universe on the largest scales and its evolution from the earliestobservationally accessible times through the formation of the complex world we live in today. This powerfulframework allows us to interpret a wide range of observations and to make detailed and precise predictionsfor new experiments. The key motivating observations include the expansion of the Universe and how it haschanged with time; the existence of radiation indicating a hot and dense early phase; the abundance of the lightelements; and how matter is organized over a wide range of physical scales. The model naturally incorporatesdark matter and dark energy, two surprising and poorly understood components that govern the growth ofstructure over time. The course will explore the history of scientific cosmology and the evidence for the Big Bangmodel, its consequences for the earliest moments after the Big Bang, and its predictions for the eventual fate ofthe Universe. Labs will include a hands-on measurement of the relic cosmic microwave background radiationfrom the early universe and the use of astronomical data to verify key discoveries in the history of Big Bangcosmology. Quantitative analysis will be an important part of the course, but prior experience with mathematicsbeyond algebra will not be required.

ASTR 1270,"00. Stars. 100 Units.Elements such as carbon and oxygen are created in fusion reactions at high temperatures and pressures in thedeep interiors of stars, conditions that naturally arise in stars like the Sun. This course will outline the physicalprinciples at work and the history of the development of the key ideas: how nuclear physics and the theory ofstellar interiors account for how stars shine, why they live for such long times, and how the heavy elements intheir cores are dispersed to form a new generation of stars. Gravity assembles stars out of more diffuse material,a process that includes the formation of planetary systems. The course shows how, taken together, these physicalprocesses naturally lead to the ingredients necessary for the emergence of life, namely elements like carbon,nitrogen, and oxygen, and planets in stable orbits around long-lived stars. The course features quantitativeanalysis of data; any tools needed beyond pre-calculus algebra will be taught as part of the course.

ASTR 1271,"00. Galaxies. 100 Units.Galaxies have been called "island universes," places where stars are concentrated, where they are born, andwhere they die. The study of galaxies reaches back to the Renaissance; Galileo Galilei first pointed a telescopeskyward in 1610 and confirmed a then 2000 year-old Greek conjecture about the nature of our own galaxy-theMilky Way. This course will use extensive modern observational data from a wide range of telescopes to tracethe modern picture for the formation and evolution of galaxies and the stars in them. Galaxies will then be usedas markers of yet larger scale structures, in order to explore the influence of gravity over cosmic time. The objectof study in this course is galaxies, and the narrative arc traced through that extensive data and understandingwill highlight our profound discovery that most of the mass in galaxies (and the Universe as a whole) is in factan exotic form of matter-dark matter-that we cannot directly see. Quantitative analysis will be an importantpart of the course in both laboratory work and lectures, but mathematics beyond algebra and some geometricunderstanding will not be required. This course will feature several observationally-oriented labs that will allowstudents to directly experience how some of the modern understanding of galaxies has arisen.

Exoplanets. 100 Units.The past two decades have witnessed the discovery of planets in orbit around other stars and the characterizationof extra-Solar (exo-) planetary systems. We are now able to place our Solar System into the context of otherworlds and a surprising conclusion that most planetary systems look nothing like our own. A challenging nextstep is to find planets as small as the Earth in orbit around stars like the Sun. The architecture of planetarysystems reflects the formation of the parent star and its protoplanetary disk, and how these have changed withtime. This course will review the techniques for discovery of planets around other stars, what we have learnedso far about exoplanetary systems, and the driving questions for the future, including the quest for habitableenvironments elsewhere.

Indeed, sincethe 1940s, yearlong sequences designed to introduce students to different types of social scientific data anddifferent forms of social sciences inquiry have become a permanent feature of the Chicago curriculum. Althoughconsiderable variety manifests itself in the way the social sciences courses in general education are organized,most of the sequences are informed, as Robert Redfield once suggested, by an attempt "to communicate thehistorical development of contemporary society" and by an effort "to convey some understanding of the scientificspirit as applied to social problems and the capacity to address oneself in that spirit to such a problem." Bytraining students in the analysis of social phenomena through the development and use of interdisciplinary andcomparative concepts, the courses also try to determine the characteristics common among many societies, thusenabling the individual to use both reason and special knowledge to confront rapid social change in the globalworld of the late twentieth century.All three courses in a SOSC sequence must be taken in order. Once students begin a sequence, they areexpected to remain in the same sequence.

BA ThesisDuring their fourth year, students majoring in sociology are expected to complete an original project ofsociological inquiry on a topic of their choice, culminating in a final paper from twenty to forty pages in length.The project is an independent research project in which questions are formulated and data are collected andanalyzed by the student. Recent projects have included studies of emerging forms of social interaction on theInternet, conflict and safety in urban Chicago neighborhoods, immigration and national identity in Germanyand Guatemala, processes of gendering in the workplace, homosexuality and AIDS in South Africa, churchleadership transition among Korean immigrants, the power of public rhetoric in public housing, role modelsamong Mexican American youth, gender roles in families of graduate students, peer pressure and teenagepregnancy, and attitudes toward immigration.The senior project is written under the guidance of an assigned preceptor from the department and a facultymember that students select during Spring Quarter of 1. Organizational Analysis. 100 Units.This course is a systematic introduction to theoretical and empirical work on organizations broadly conceived(e.g., public and private economic organizations, governmental organizations, prisons, professional andvoluntary associations, health-care organizations). Topics include intraorganizational questions aboutorganizational goals and effectiveness, communication, authority, and decision making. Using recentdevelopments in market, political economy, and neoinstitutional theories, we explore organizational change andinterorganizational relationships for their implications in understanding social change in modern societies. Socialnetwork analysis will inform much of the discussion.Instructor(s): E. Laumann Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): 3. Social Stratification. 100 Units.Social stratification is the unequal distribution of the goods that members of a society value - earnings, income,authority, political power, status, prestige etc. This course introduces various sociological perspectives aboutstratification. We look at major patterns of inequality throughout human history, how they vary across countries,how they are formed and maintained, how they come to be seen as legitimate and desirable, and how they affectthe lives of individuals within a society. The readings incorporate classical theoretical statements, contemporarydebates, and recent empirical evidence. The information and ideas discussed in this course are critical forstudents who will go on in sociology and extremely useful for students who want to be informed about currentsocial, economic, and political issues.Instructor(s): R.

Students should read the complete narrative descriptions because the summary eliminatesessential information. An explanation of the components of each course entry follows.Course NumberingUnless an exception is noted, course numbering typically follows standard guidelines. Courses numbered10000 are general education and introductory courses. Courses numbered 20000 are intermediate, advanced,or upper-level courses that are open only to undergraduates. Courses numbered 30000 and above aregraduate courses that are available only to undergraduate students who obtain the consent of the instructor.Undergraduates registered for 30000-level courses will be held to graduate-level requirements. When a courseis cross listed between the College (10000- to 20000-level courses) and graduate divisions or professional schools (coursesnumbered 30000 and above), College students may only register for the undergraduate number. Higher-numberedcourses within each of these categories do not indicate increasing levels of difficulty.In some departments, students with advanced standing and consent of instructor may register for higher-level courses. Except for language instruction courses, these courses are not listed in this catalog; students shouldcontact individual departments for further information.A number shown, for example, as 211xx, indicates that it is a course within the series 21100 through 21199;any information that describes 211xx applies to the entire range of courses available within the series.Course DescriptionA narrative description follows the course number and title. Unless otherwise designated, courses are taughton campus."L" at the end of the course description indicates that the course has a laboratory requirement. Courses withlaboratories do not yield extra credit.UnitsA student receives 100 units of course credit for most undergraduate courses.

Faculty in the Department of Anthropology specialize in sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, andbiological anthropological approaches. They take up questions of anatomy, ecology, and genomics, as well aspsychological, economic, philosophical, and historical issues, often in comparative perspective. Anthropologycan lead (through graduate study) to careers in research and teaching in university and museum settings. Moreoften it provides a background for further work in other disciplines of the social sciences, humanities, andbiological sciences, as well as for professional careers in government, non-governmental work, business, law,medicine, social services, and other fields.For more information, see the Department of Anthropology website (http://anthropology.uchicago.edu).Program RequirementsThe BA program in anthropology consists of twelve courses, of which at least ten are typically chosen fromthose listed or cross-listed as Department of Anthropology courses.

Anthropological Theory. 100 Units.Since its inception as an academically institutionalized discipline, anthropology has always addressed therelation between a self-consciously modernizing West and its various and changing others. Yet it has not alwaysdone so with sufficient critical attention to its own concepts and categories-a fact that has led, since at leastthe 1980s, to considerable debate about the nature of the anthropological enterprise and its epistemologicalfoundations. This course provides a brief critical introduction to the history of anthropological thought over thecourse of the discipline's long twentieth century, form the 1880s to the present. Although we focus on the NorthAmerican and British traditions, we review important strains of French and, to a lesser extent, German socialtheory in chronicling the emergence and transformation of modern anthropology as an empirically based, buttheoretically informed, practice of knowledge production about human sociality and culture.Instructor(s): S.

Art history courses develop students' skills in visual analysis, interpretation ofimages and texts, use of historical sources, and engagement with scholarly debates. So conceived, the studyof art is an element of a general, liberal arts education; the skills of analytical thinking, logical argument, andclear verbal expression necessary to the program are basic to most fields. While maintaining the University ofChicago’s traditional emphasis on the life of the mind, the major in art history prepares students for advancedstudy at the graduate level as well as for a wide array of careers involving visual acuity, design, research, andanalysis.Within the Art History Department, courses at the 10000-level meet the general education requirement inthe arts. These courses may not be taken for credit toward the major, although majors are strongly encouraged totake at least one (1) to meet their general education requirements. Upper-level courses (20000-level) may take arelatively broad or narrow approach to particular periods, places, themes, or issues, or may deal with theoreticalquestions. The usual prerequisite for 20000-level Art History courses is consent of instructor or any 10000-levelcourse in Art History or Visual Arts.General Education CoursesAny of these 10000-level courses is an appropriate choice for any undergraduate to meet the generaleducation requirement in the arts.

ANTH 1960,"1. Populism and Its Discontents. 100 Units.Populism and its Discontents is a reading-based undergraduate discussion seminar. Populism is currently theword on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in currentpublic debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time asthe dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, butare not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Does populism lookdifferent in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the GlobalSouth force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants?

ANTH 2000,"3. Discovering Anthropology: Reading Race. 100 Units.Before and since Anthropology became a discrete scientific field of study, questions about the biological reality,potential utility and misuse of the concept of race in Homo sapiens have been debated. We will read and discussa sample of writings by 18th, 19th, and 20th century and contemporary authors who attempted to define humanraces and those who have promoted or debunked the utility of the concept of race with special attention to it rolein retarding social progress, and the extermination and exploitation of some populations and individuals.Instructor(s): R. Tuttle Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): 9. Embodiment: Governance, Resistance, Ethics. 100 Units.What does a study of the body teach us about governance and the experience of being governed? This courseapproaches bodies from three angles. First, bodies are targets of governance. They are objects to be reformed,regulated, contained, disciplined, educated, incarcerated, treated, trained, and "cared" for. Next, as bodies gettargeted for reform, they are also converted into potent sites of resistance and critique. Certain bodies in certainplaces elicit discomfort, unsettling common ideals of private and public, of developed and backward, of religiousand secular, and, with them, dominant understandings of modern citizenship. Finally, bodies in their sensory andaffective capacities are also mobilized as resources for crafting belonging beyond the assigned terms of law orthe state. Drawing from ethnographic texts and with special emphasis on Latin America, this course introducesstudents to the anthropology of embodiment as well as related themes of bio-politics, gender, intimacy, politicalsubjectivity, care and self-making, post/colonialism, race, and aesthetics. In so doing, the hope is to generate newways to make sense of matters near and far-from Lenin's body to Trump's hands, reproductive labor to sex work,dirty protest to women's marches, indigenous eco-rituals to queer intimacies.Instructor(s): Mareike Winchell Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): This course qualifies as a Discovering Anthropology selection for Anthropology majors.2018-2019 The College            893Discovering Anthropology: Reading Race1009Embodiment: Governance, Resistance, Ethics1003, 2 Discovering Anthropology: Culture, Technology, Mediation"

ANTH 2001,"0. Anthropology of the Future. 100 Units.Two major subfields of anthropology - archaeology and ethnography - have traditionally been oriented aroundthe human past and the human present. But what about the future? Conceptions of the future and future-oriented behavior have long been understood to be a critical plane of difference between political economies,religions, and cultural groups, yet they have rarely been an explicit focus of study. When we shift the temporalframe to the future, questions that arise include: do all cultures have theories of the future? how much abouthuman societies are intentional? how does ideology shape future possibilities? what role do imagined futuresplay in political life? We will consider theories of temporality, past futures (Aztec, Polynesian, Italian), andmovements such as millenarianism, messianic religions, Marxism, Dadaism, utopian communities, Afro-futurism, transhumanism, and today's neo-futurist movements that deploy radical technology and speculativedesign in response to looming climate change.

Peasants: Anthropology, Rural Life, Capitalism. 100 Units.Only a few short decades ago, rural societies were at the center of anthropological inquiry and key sourcesof ethnographic insight. Today, anthropological attentions have redirected toward cityscapes and urbanexperiences, leading a recent review piece to wonder: "Where have all the peasants gone?" The answer, of course,is nowhere. Peasants may have slipped by the wayside of analysis, but nearly half of the world's populationtoday remains rural, and more than ever, countrysides are acutely affected by the economic transformationsreshaping our world and the uncertainties facing our future: the challenges of food security, sustainable living,(agricultural) biotechnology, ecological precariousness, global poverty, and escalating rates of urbanization andurban migration. In a decidedly non-trendy move, then, this course will take the anthropology of peasantryas its focus, and will make the case that small-scale farming communities remain highly relevant sites fordiagnosing capitalism's changing conditions and its lived consequences. Our discussions will be at oncehistorical, conceptual, and ethnographic, and will draw on a broad set of case-studies around the globe. Wewill review classic debates about peasantries in relation to the history of capitalism, and reflect on the analyticalpossibilities and limitations of the peasant concept.Instructor(s): Francois Richard Terms Offered: AutumnPrerequisite(s): This course qualifies as a Discovering Anthropology selection for Anthropology majors."
ANTH 2014,"4. London Program: Institution. 100 Units.In the first part of the course, focusing on William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's monumentalpoetic work Lyrical Ballads (1798), we will consider the implications of revolutions abroad and ofinstitutionalizations of arts and culture at home for the rise of modern literary culture in Romantic-era Britain.Wordsworth famously envisioned a new role for the poet as that of a "man speaking to men" who could make"incidents and situations from common life" the proper matter of literature. As he did so, Wordsworth wasconfronting both the disappointed hope of the "blissful dawn" of the French Revolution and a cultural milieureshaped by the emergence of institutions like the British Museum (1753), the Royal Academy of Art (1768),and the National Gallery (1824)-all of which continue to define British national culture. In the second part of thecourse, we will consider analogous developments of the present moment, including the institutionalization ofnew arts like fashion, to consider where (in what scenes, and in what forms of writing and media) we might lookfor Lyrical Ballads of our own time.

These courses provide an overview of contemporary environmental issues and the theoretical andempirical approaches used to understand and address them.Thematic Tracks in Environmental and Urban StudiesStudents complete a total of six courses: four courses within the track they have selected as their area ofemphasis and two complementary courses from one of the remaining tracks. Lists of approved courses can befound on the department’s website.•Environmental Economics and Policy Track: This concentration emphasizes issues such asenvironmental law, development, globalization, and policy studies. This track has a more appliedfocus and is inclined more toward present-day issues and strategies in the context of politics, law, andeconomics.•Socio-natural Systems and Frameworks Track: This concentration emphasizes environmentalhistory; landscape studies; human ecology and demography; and environmental ethics, philosophy,and representation. Included in this track are courses on cultural and historical constructions ofthe natural and the human. This track emphasizes intellectual frameworks as well as the use ofsubstantive information from the social sciences, sciences, and humanities.•Urban Environment Track: This concentration emphasizes theoretical and practical perspectiveson human interaction with the urban, physical environment. The track encourages a spatial and place-based urban perspective, meaning that built form and environmental context provide the conceptualcore through which the social, economic, and political understanding of urbanism is pursued. Thetrack approaches the nature and dynamics of cities by capitalizing on the growth of interest in urbanplanning, urban sustainability, and urban design.368         Environmental and Urban StudiesQuantitative Analysis RequirementOne course must be taken to demonstrate competence in quantitative analysis.

The approval of the program director for the minor program should be submitted to astudent's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser.Courses in the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minorsand (2) may not be counted toward general education requirements. Courses in the minor must be taken forquality grades, and at least half of the requirements for the minor must be met by registering for courses bearingUniversity of Chicago course numbers.Experiential Learning OpportunitiesThe Environmental and Urban Studies major offers experiential learning opportunities through practicumcourses, the Chicago Studies Quarter and the Chicago Studies Certificate Program. Students in all tracks, and inparticular the Urban Environment track, are encouraged to enroll in these programs, which offer immersion inthe academic, experiential, interdisciplinary study of Chicago and its region. For more information about theseprograms, please see the listing in this catalog or visit chicagostudies.uchicago.edu.Chicago Studies QuarterEach spring, a small cohort of students studies the culture, politics, and history of the city through acurriculum of three interrelated courses with a common theme through the Chicago Studies Quarter. Admissionto the program is competitive. Courses are taught by Chicago specialists from a variety of disciplines and joinclassroom instruction with weekly excursions and co-curricular activities.All courses in the Chicago Studies Quarter will have an Environmental and Urban Studies course number.They are also listed in all three tracks of the major and can therefore be taken to satisfy requirements eitherwithin or outside the student’s primary track.Chicago Studies Quarter: CalumetSince 2012, the Calumet Quarter has offered a one-quarter, intensive, experience-based program focusedon human land use in the Calumet Region just south and east of the city. As of 2017–18, it has merged with theChicago Studies Quarter and is officially known as the Chicago Studies Quarter: Calumet. It features integratedcourses, projects, field trips, guest lectures, and presentations, and integrates perspectives from the sciences,humanities, and social sciences in the study of local environments and communities.Chicago Studies Quarter: Calumet is offered every other year. The next offering will be in Spring Quarter2020. Courses taken as part of this program can be used to satisfy requirements in all three tracks of the major.Chicago Studies CertificateThe Chicago Studies Certificate, launched in 2017–18, is designed for students who wish to integrate theiracademic inquiry with positive impact in Chicago through sustained community engagement, urban scholarship,370         Environmental and Urban Studiesand creative expression. The certificate is overseen by the University Community Service Center in collaborationwith the Environmental and Urban Studies program, which supervises the program’s academic requirements.Completion of the Chicago Studies Certificate will satisfy the internship/field study requirement for theEnvironmental and Urban Studies major. Environmental Studies Courses1. Making the Natural World: Foundations of Human Ecology. 100 Units.Humans have "made" the natural world both conceptually, through the creation of various ideas about nature,ecosystem, organism, and ecology, and materially, through millennia of direct action in and on the landscape.Students will consider the conceptual underpinnings of contemporary notions of ecology, environment, andbalance through the examination of specific historical trajectories of anthropogenic landscape modification andhuman society.Instructor(s): Alison Anastasio Terms Offered: WinterNote(s): "

ANTH 2133,"3. The Lived Body: Anthropology, Materiality, Meaningful Practice. 100 Units.The body is implicated in all facets of human life. It is at once constraint and enabler, relational and personal,"real" and "imagined." It is both individually performed and socially determined, the site of both dominationand resistance. Anthropological theory has moved far from "Cartesian dualism" in which mind and body canand must be separate; this course will travel through ways of understanding bodies that have supplementedor bypassed this idea, or have existed outside of it entirely. We will consider what it means to have a body, toknow a body, to be defined by a body-in short, to live a body. This course's topical readings are oriented aroundthe idea that "embodiment" involves both material entities and socially embedded processes. We will considerexperience, consciousness, sensation, perception, and affect; we will interrogate processes, functions, and waysof knowing that are often taken for granted; we will prise apart the ways power is inscribed on and with bodies,both internally and externally. To do so, we will balance theory and ethnography in both our consumption andproduction of scholarly material, including a final "auto-ethnography" in which students adopt a new bodypractice for the quarter.Instructor(s): A.

ANTH 2134,"1. Making Plants Work: Anthropology of Human-Plant Relationships. 100 Units.Food, drink, fuel, pharmaceuticals, clothing, cosmetics, construction material, furniture… Plants and theirbyproducts are everywhere we look. How have plants become so ubiquitous to human life? How have plantsbeen used, adapted, processed, and sold over the course of history? How can studying plants and theirinteractions with humans provide a different perspective on the past, and insight into the future? This courseexplores how humans have made plants "work," and how these working plants have, in turn, shaped the worldin which we live. While often perceived as passive in comparison to human and animal counterparts, plantshave played a critical role in shaping global social, economic, ecological, and political dynamics. As desiredproducts, plants have entangled far-flung individuals and societies into complex relationships that reverberateacross time and space. This course will survey the history of human-plant interactions through three units:domestication, colonialism, and modern technologies. We will examine a wide range of case studies, in an effortto gain comparative and multivocal understanding of human-plant relationships. In doing so, course materialstouch on topics of general anthropological interest: political ecology, agency, social inequality, labor, globalprocesses, the impacts of colonialism, the production of knowledge, and human/non-human relationships.Instructor(s): Pacyga, Johanna Terms Offered: Spring2018-2019 The College            932. Welcome to the Good Life: The Black Edition. 100 Units.What do we mean when we say "the good life"? In the United States, the good life has long been synonymouswith the idea of the American dream (the white picket fence, secure union job, stable marriage with 2.5 kids).But over the past several years, this romanticized image has increasingly been thrown into crisis with the riseof a destabilized national economy, political infighting, and in the aftermath of the housing collapse. It seems asthough the veil has been lifted and the American Dream has been exposed as a fantasy object, if not a completeimpossibility. But for people of color, and black people in particular who have been historically disenfranchisedand thus unable to access the housing, education, and medical resources necessary to make the Americandream a reality, this fantasy has always already been understood as such. Indeed, black experiences reveal howwhiteness as a structural mechanism stands at the foundation of the American Dream.Instructor(s): Bock, Emily Terms Offered: Spring. Spring 20193. Anthropology and/of Tourism: Of Otherness and Encounters. 100 Units.Travelling as a mode of self-cultivation and world awareness has always captivated our imagination. Withincreasing ease of travel, tourism is a $ 2.3 trillion industry, with 1.25 billion annual travelers. How does readingethnographies of tourism help us examine encounters with others as anthropology's central prerogative? FromEmerson's quote - is the meaning of an encounter located within us or in the object? Is otherness some inherentquality or a product of specific narratives and practices? Encountering otherness being anthropology's primaryresearch methodology, can ethnographers be compared to tourists? How is the discipline itself implicatedin unequal power relations of cultural encounters? We will read ethnographies covering a range of concernsabout tourism - its linkages with colonialism/neo-colonialism, its role in stereotyping indigenous cultures,its impact on the environment, on gender dynamics, on representations of nationhood and on cultivation ofbourgeois selfhood. Our aim is to use anthropological insights to appraise the phenomenon of tourism as awhole, identifying its pros and cons; and to also flip this perspective to ask: what insights does tourism give usinto encounters and othering as foundational concerns of anthropology?Instructor(s): Das, Suchismita Terms Offered: Winter.

The Meaning of Police. 100 Units.The purpose of this class is to offer students an intellectual toolkit for thinking critically and engaging politicallywith contemporary problems of police. It will introduce classical as well as emerging themes, drawing onresearch from diverse social and geographical locations. We will discuss, among other things, the paradox oflegal lawlessness, the relationship between law and the body, and the unstable distinction between public andprivate violence. Paying attention to classed, sexed, and racialized notions of danger and threat, we will discussthe historical fabrication of criminality as well as the complex legacies of security and protection that underpinpractices of criminal punishment. While subjecting policing to an anthropological interrogation-asking whatpolice means for different people in different times and places-we will also consider the uneasy affinity betweenpolicemen and ethnographers in order to ask what it can teach us about police, and how it might illuminate ourunderstanding of ethnography.Instructor(s): Maoz, Eilat Terms Offered: Autumn.

ANTH 2143,"1. Counting, Calculation and Computation: Anthropologies of Number. 100 Units.This seminar introduces undergraduates to anthropologies of counting, calculation and computation. The courseis split into two parts. In part one (Weeks 1-3), we will explore anthropological and historical approaches tonumber, mathematics and calculation per se, with the goal of developing an analytical toolset through whichwe can approach the categories "counting" and "number" more critically and creatively. In part two (Weeks4-10), we expand on this toolset ethnographically, moving through a series of cases to examine how number,counting and calculation are situated variously in contemporary social life, with powerful ethical, political andeven biological effects. We will move through themes including war and genocide, health and the body, human-machine interfaces, "state science", environmental metrics, and software algorithms and "big data". The ultimateobjective will be to train students to identify and interrogate some of the myriad ways that number is always-already situated in social life - not coming objectively "from nowhere". At the same time, we will try to firmlyroot our project in an anthropology of number per se, approaching our ethnographic selections from a footingslightly outside of STS or familiar humanist critiques of statistics. Together, we will test whether this footingleads us somewhere new.Instructor(s): Mullee, John Terms Offered: Winter. Winter 2019"

To what extent do diseases and disorders have an independent existence, andto what extent are they cultural constructs? How have social mores-particularly those related to religion, class,nationality, race, and gender-influenced the ways in which health was and is understood and maintained, andillness treated? What does it mean to practice medicine ethically, and how has that changed over time? Topicsinclude the emergence and evolution of the medical profession, the history of medical research and method, theinterpretation and treatment of the unhealthy and healthy alike, eugenics, euthanasia, the quest for immortality,and the changing relationship between technology and disease.Equivalent Course(s): 9. History of Extraterrestrial Life. 100 Units.In 2014, the Vatican Radio made a splash when it reported that the pontiff, Pope Francis, condoned thebaptism of extraterrestrials-if they so desired it. "Who are we to close doors?" he asked rhetorically. It wasboth a metaphor for spiritual inclusion and an accurate representation of the modern Vatican's position on thepossibilities of modern astrobiology and the search for extrasolar planets, fields whose rapid growth over thepast two decades make serious consideration of extraterrestrial life seem like a uniquely modern phenomena.Its history, however, is in fact many centuries old. In this course we will examine the development of beliefsconcerning life in the universe from the sixteenth century to the present. How did historical actors understandthe nature, abilities, and location of extraterrestrial life, and its relationship to man and god? We will analyzeconnections between these beliefs and contemporary political, social, scientific, and religious developments.These include the role of the plurality of worlds in the debates over heliocentrism, its impact and applicationin the context of deism and social and political freethought, its literary and artistic depictions and use as a toolof satire and social commentary, its influence on natural philosophy, its decline and the subsequent rise of alienconspiracists and their critics, and how and why conceptions of the extraplanetary other took a dark and sinisterturn toward the early-to-mid twentieth century.Equivalent Course(s): "

Sex, Race, and Empire. 100 Units.This course surveys how science, race, and gender interacted in the early modern Atlantic world from 1500-1800.We will critically examine how new modes of scientific inquiry brought Africans, Americans, and Europeansinto contact and conflict. Along the way, we will ask how, why, and with consequences imperial science creatednew knowledge claims about human inequality, especially racial and sexual difference. We will draw primarilyon British, Iberian, and French imperial agendas in order to track the experiences of men and women from allcorners of the Atlantic world, including indigenous peoples, enslaved black Africans, free people of color, andwhite Europeans. Through a variety of primary and secondary sources, we will uncover European aspirationsto curate, control, and exploit the natural world and the agency of subjugated peoples in responding to andresisting these designs. Topics covered include natural history collecting and classification; the invention of racialtheory; slavery and maroons; women, gender, and reproduction; consumption; and violence, resistance, andrevolution.Equivalent Course(s): 3. Sex and Enlightenment Science. 100 Units.What do a lifelike wax woman, a birthing dummy, and a hermaphrodite have in common? This interdisciplinarycourse seeks answers to this question by exploring how eighteenth-century scientific and medical ideas,technologies, and practices interacted with and influenced contemporary notions of sex, sexuality, and gender. Inour course, the terms "sex," "Enlightenment," and "science" will be problematized in their historic contexts usinga variety of primary and secondary sources. Through these texts, as well as images and objects, we will see howemerging scientific theories about sex, sexuality, and gender contributed to new understandings of the human,especially female, body. We will also see how the liberating potential of Enlightenment thought gave way tosexual and racial theories that insisted on fundamental human difference. Topics to be covered include theoriesof generation, childbirth, homosexuality, monstrosities, race and procreation, and hermaphrodites and questionsabout the "sex" of the enlightened scientist and the gendering of scientific practices.Equivalent Course(s): 4.

We will pay particular attention to the way in which transformism was afeature of nineteenth-century thought more generally, connecting natural history to astronomy, theology, andthe study of humanity. Natural philosophers and later scientists who wished to make arguments concerningnature's deep past and hidden or obscured processes (such as the long-term transformations of stars, strata, andorganic species) faced an essential problem: the power of observation and experiment was limited. Our classwill interrogate this problem, and examine the way in which the development of evolutionary thought prior toDarwin was intimately connected to contentious debates regarding speculation and scientific method. We willconclude by contemplating the ways in which the ideas and challenges raised by transformism and evolutioninfluenced the reception of Darwin's work, and the way in which these ideas and challenges remain embeddedwithin seemingly disparate fields of study today.Instructor(s): J.

In our course, theconcept of "reproduction" will be problematized through film, advertising, texts, literature, and objects. Throughthese sources, we will critically explore how popular representations of human reproduction have shaped thestatus of the female body and notions of motherhood over time. We will also see how the liberating potential ofnew forms of multimedia have often served to reinforce--rather than resist or re-imagine--longstanding motifsand beliefs surrounding the maternal body and womanhood, from the image of the hysterical woman to that ofthe monstrous mother. Themes covered include the science of reproduction, hysteria, monstrosities, maternalimagination, artificial life, race, contraception, in/fertility, and sex education.Instructor(s): Margaret Carlyle Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): "

Latin American Extractivisms. 100 Units.This course will survey the historical antecedents and contemporary politics of Latin American extractivisms.While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current"neoextractivisms" have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells,open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformationsto local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present.

The course analytically foregrounds problems of governance, resource distribution, and sociopoliticalcomplexity, providing students with a representative range of case studies from across the subcontinent andinterrogating what it means for social and economic goods to be labeled human rights. Throughout the coursestudents will examine diverse housing arrangements and policies in the context of national, regional, and globaldevelopment histories. Ultimately, this course advances comprehension of the particularities of contemporaryLatin American societies and the particularities shared with the Global South and the world at large.Instructor(s): Inés Escobar González Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): 33"

Latin American Extractivisms. 100 Units.This course will survey the historical antecedents and contemporary politics of Latin American extractivisms.While resource extraction in Latin America is far from new, the scale and transnational scope of current"neoextractivisms" have unearthed unprecedented rates of profit as well as social conflict. Today's oil wells,open-pit mines, and vast fields of industrial agriculture have generated previously unthinkable transformationsto local ecologies and social life, while repeating histories of indigenous land dispossession in the present. Yetparallel to neo-extractive regimes, emergent Latin American social movements have unleashed impassioned andoften unexpected forms of local and transnational resistance.

ANTH 2360,"7. The Immigrant as American Prototype. 100 Units.This undergraduate seminar explores how the figure of "the immigrant" has come to mediate various originmyths and anticipatory imaginations of "Americanness" in contemporary political struggles. A centralproposition of the course is that "the immigrant" should be seen NOT as an "original" founding subject of theUnited States and its "American Dream" but rather, as a modern prototype-forged only since the late 19thcentury-for stress-testing different models of American presence and power in the world. Importantly, this is aworld increasingly ordered, as well as destabilized, by the expanding logics of industrial and corporate capital-a historical development with reverberating effects into our contemporary debates over the relation of "theimmigrant" to American "values" and global "competitiveness." Drawing on various historical, anthropologicaland audiovisual resources, this seminar aims to situate the emergence of "the immigrant" as American prototypein relation to (1) earlier cultural-historical archetypes of mass migration, such as "the settler" and "the emigrant"and (2) current debates over nativist and cosmopolitan models of American security-cum-prosperity that take"the immigrant" as the limit case for evaluating "the human," "the normal," and "the good life" across nationalistand globalizing space-times. Besides conventional reading and writing assignments, this seminar will offerstudents the opportunity to experiment with multimedia methods for ethnographic research through a finalweb-based project in which students will draw from current news and popular media sources to assemble andcritically present on their own version of "the Immigrant" as American prototype.Instructor(s): J.

ANTH 2380,"2. Populism and its Discontents. 100 Units.’Populism and its Discontents' is a reading-based undergraduate discussion seminar. Populism is currently theword on everyone's lips. But what does it mean? We begin with the ambiguous status of populism in currentpublic debates; populism is at once imagined as the lifeblood of genuine democracy and at the same time asthe dark force that threatens democracy from within. Why should this be? Questions to be covered include, butare not limited to, the following: Are there progressive and regressive forms of populism? Dose populism lookdifferent in today's social media-saturated world than it did a hundred years ago? Does populism in the GlobalSouth force us to reconsider what we think we know about its Euro-American variants?

ANTH 2430,"2. Disability in Local and Global Contexts. 100 Units.This is a course about intersections. Disability cuts across age, gender, class, caste, occupation, and religion- ordoes it? By some measures, people with disabilities are the largest minority group in the world today. In thiscourse, we critically examine both the experiences of people with disabilities in a global context as well as thepolitics and processes of writing about such experiences. Indeed, questions of representation are perhaps at thecore of this course. What role have the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons with Disabilitiesand international organizations such as the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and other non-governmental social and human service agencies played in the creation of specific understandings of disabilityexperience? We will ask whether disability is a universal category and we will consider how experiences ofhealth, illness, disability, and debility vary. We will engage in "concept work" by analyzing the relationshipsbetween disability and impairment and we will critically evaluate the different conceptual and analytical modelsemployed to think about disability. In doing so, we will engage with broader questions about internationaldevelopment, human rights, the boundaries of the nation, the family and other kinship affiliations, and identityand community formation. How is disability both a productive analytic and a lens for thinking about pressingquestions and concerns in today's world?Equivalent Course(s): 7.

The starting point for the course is that the reproduction of bodies is differently understoodand politically contested among and for various groups of people. We will pay particular attention to the waysbodies, ideas, and technologies flow throughout global contexts, while exploring how inequalities at variouslevels (race, class, geographic region, nationality, gender, sexuality, practices of family making) impact the"nature" of the reproductive body, and how reproductive practices "reproduce" such inequalities. We will alsoexplore how knowledge of the reproductive body is contested through biomedicine, law, and media, withparticular attention to naturalizing discourse about gender and intuition.

ANTH 2434,"5. Anthropology and 'The Good Life': Ethics, Morality, Well-Being. 100 Units.This course takes a critical, historical and anthropological look at what is meant by "the good life."Anthropologists have long been aware that notions of "the good" play an essential role in directing humanbehavior, by providing a life with meaning and shaping what it means to be a human being. Over the pastseveral years, however, there has been an increasing demand for clarification on what is meant by "the good life,"as well as how cultural conceptions of "the good" relate to science, politics, religion, and personal practice. Inthis course, we will take up that challenge by exploring what is meant by "the good," focusing on three domainsin which it has most productively been theorized: ethics, morality, and well-being. Through a close reading ofethnographic and theoretical texts, as well as through analysis of documents and resources used and producedby different communities in order to explore the good life, we will gain an understanding of the differenttheoretical and methodological approaches for understanding the good in the social sciences, the variouscultural logics shaping knowledge and practices of the good, and how human experience is shaped by thoseiterations in the process. The topics to be discussed include: the good life, moral reason, moral relativism, utility,deontology, virtue, happiness, well-being, flourishing, techniques of the self, spiritual exercises, professionalethics, neuroethics, and the moral sentiments.Equivalent Course(s): 5Anthropology and 'The Good Life': Ethics, Morality, Well-Being100"

Experiencing Madness: Empathic Methods in Cultural Psychiatry. 100 Units.This course provides students with an introduction to the phenomenological approach in cultural psychiatry,focusing on the problem of "how to represent mental illness" as a thematic anchor. Students will examine thetheoretical and methodological groundings of cultural psychiatry, examining how scholars working in thephenomenological tradition have tried to describe the lived experiences of various forms of "psychopathology" or"madness." By the end of the course, students will have learned how to describe and analyze the social dimensionof a mental health experience, using a phenomenologically-grounded anthropological approach, and by adoptinga technical vocabulary for understanding the lived experiences of mental illness (for instance, phenomena,life-world, being-in-the-world, intentionality, epoché, embodiment, madness, psychopathology, melancholia/depression, schizophrenia, etc). In addition, given the ongoing problematic of "how to represent mental illness,"students will also have the opportunity to think through the different ways of presenting their analysis, both inthe form of weekly blog entries and during a final-week mock-workshop, where they will showcase their work ina creative medium appropriate to that analysis.Equivalent Course(s): 5, "

ANTH 2520,"0. Approaches to Gender in Anthropology. 100 Units.This course examines gender as a cultural category in anthropological theory, as well as in everyday life. Afterreviewing the historical sources of the current concern with women, gender, and sexuality in anthropology andthe other social sciences, we critically explore some key controversies (e.g., the relationship between productionand reproduction in different socio-cultural orders; the links between "public" and "private" in current theories ofpolitics; and the construction of sexualities, nationalities, and citizenship in a globalizing world).Instructor(s): S. Gal Terms Offered: TBDEquivalent Course(s): 7. Gender, Sexuality, & Religion. 100 Units.In many cultural contexts today, religion is often seen as a socially conservative force in public and politicalrealms. For instance, Christian "pro-life" movements in the US often draw on tropes of women's "traditional" roleas mothers to argue against easily accessible abortion clinics or contraceptives; recent faith-based objections tolegal protections for LGBTQ individuals; and debates in the US and Western Europe about Muslim women's useof the veil as inherently disempowering women. Social scientists have often noted the logics of duality that shapeour contemporary world: religious/secular, traditional/modern, conservative/liberal, private/public, etc. Withinthis logic, religious peoples are presumed to be traditional or "primitive" and therefore hostile to modernity orforeclosed from being modern. Similarly, to be progressive or liberal, one is assumed to be secular and skepticalof religion. Is it always the case, though, that religion is conservative, traditional, and works to maintain thestatus quo of possible gender roles and sexual identities in society? The goal of this course is to investigate thisquestion. We will look at contemporary places around the world, multiple religions, and various genders andsexualities in order to complicate the picture of how religion and gender inform one another.Equivalent Course(s): 9. Morality across the Life Course. 100 Units.Morality across the Life Course. What does it mean to be a moral person? And how do moral expectations withina given society shift across the life course? Social scientists have noted that what it means to be a moral childmay not always be the same as what it means to be a moral adolescent or middle-aged adult. At the same time,scholars have been interested in how moral ideals pass from one generation to another through processes suchas socialization. Social reproduction must also deal with globalization and other sources of social change. Byhoning in on such processes of social reproduction and change, many have suggested we may better understandhow moral beliefs change across generations and over time. In this course we will explore these processes ofmoral development, socialization, and change, drawing largely on anthropological and psychological research.While early developmental psychologists theorized moral development as stage-based and teleological (i.e.,an ultimate, ideal adult moral personhood towards which developmental stages were progressive steps),anthropologists and cultural psychologists working in many different cultural contexts have complicated thisunderstanding of morality. We will begin the quarter by looking at some of the early texts and theories aboutmoral development in addition to early concerns about social reproduction across generations. Afterwards wewill turn to a series of ethnographic monographs in order to explore in detail how particular life course stages areconceptualized in moral terms in various parts of the world and in different contexts of social change.Equivalent Course(s): "

How do different states with large populations of refugees and asylum seekers develop and enforcemigration policies, and what do the differences in these policies reveal about the social histories and futures ofthese states? To address these questions, we will consider how borders, institutions, and categories of migrantgroups mutually shape one another. We will explore the interrelationships between categories of migration-forced, economic, regular, and irregular-in order to understand the multiple and unequal forms of mobilityexperienced by those who inhabit these categories. By utilizing a framework of human rights, this course willinvestigate how contemporary issues in migration-such as border management, illicit movement, and the fuzzydistinction between forced and economic migration-raise and reopen debates concerning the management ofdifference. We will draw on the work of anthropologists, sociologists, and geographers, as well as journalists,legal, and medical professionals.

Consumption. 100 Units.The modern period was associated with industrial production, class society, rationalization, disenchantment,the welfare state, and the belief in salvation by society. Current societies are characterized by a culture ofconsumption; consumption is central to lifestyles and identity, it is instantiated in our technological reality andthe complex of advertising media, structures of wanting and shopping. Starting from the question "why do wewant things" we will discuss theories and empirical studies that focus on consumption and identity formation; onshopping and the consumption of symbolic signs; on consumption as linked to the re-enchantment of modernity;as a process of distinction and of the globalization of frames; and as related to time and information. The courseis built around approaches that complement the "productionist" focus of the social sciences.

From SiliconValley's reinvention of the world through technology, to Hollywood's national storytelling through film, fromDisney's fantasyland to San Francisco's communes to LA's metropolis, California is a lightening rod for variousvisions of the future. It epitomizes the "frontier" where traditions hold less sway, especially for women andLGBTQ people. Both reactionary and progressive when confronted with social change, California previewsdebates that later happen on a national stage. Its current opposition to federal immigration policy should beconsidered alongside its history of legalized sinophobia and Japanese internment. It exaggerates Americanideals and disgraces; consider the Gold Rush, which epitomized an American Dream of wealth for the takingand entailed a brutal genocide of Native Californians. The Bay Area sustainability cult exists alongside the mostpolluted places in the country. California hosts extremes of poverty and wealth, urban and rural, liberalism andconservatism (Reagan was, after all, Californian). We will consider California through ethnography, history,literature, sociology, theory, film, photography, and music. How do ideas about a place, and its lived reality,mutually shape each other? What is the role of utopian/dystopian thinking? A premise of the course is thatutopia for some is dystopia for others."

Archaeology of Bronze Age China. 100 Units.Bronze Age" in China conventionally refers to the time period from ca. 2000 BC to about 500 BC, during whichbronze, an alloy of copper and other metals such as tin and lead, was the predominant medium used by thesociety, or to be more precise, the elite classes of the society. Bronze objects, in the forms of vessels, weapons,and musical instruments, were reserved for the upper ruling class of the society and were used mostly asparaphernalia during rituals and feasting. "Bronze Age" in China also indicates the emergence and eventualmaturation of states with their bureaucratic systems, the presence of urban centers, a sophisticated writingsystem, and advanced craft producing industries, especially metal production. This course surveys the importantarchaeological finds of Bronze Age China and the theoretical issues such as state formation, craft production,writing, bureaucratic systems, urbanization, warfare, and inter-regional interaction, etc. It emphasizes a multi-disciplinary approach with readings and examples from anthropology, archaeology, art history, and epigraphy.This course will also visit the Smart Museum, the Field Museum, and the Art Institute of Chicago to takeadvantage of the local collections of ancient Chinese arts and archaeology.Instructor(s): Y.

Starting with a laboratory based general introduction to human osteology andmuscle function, the latest on morphological and behavioral evidence for what makes Homo sapiens and theirfossil ancestors unique among primates will be presented. Our knowledge of the last common ancestor will beexplored using the late Miocene fossil record followed by a series of lectures on comparative and functionalmorphology, adaptation and biogeography of fossil human species. With focus on the human fossil record, theemergence of bipedalism, advent of stone tool use and making, abandonment of arboreality, advent of endurancewalking and running, dawn of encephalization and associated novel life histories, language and symbolism willbe explored. While taxonomic identities and phylogenetic relationships will be briefly presented, the focus willbe on investigating major adaptive transitions and how that understanding helps us to unravel the ecologicalselective factors that ultimately led to the emergence of our species. The course will be supported by fresh datacoming from active field research conducted by Prof. Alemseged and state of the art visualization methods thathelp explore internal structures.

Anoverview of the biology and evolution of the mammalian order Primates provides a broad foundation forconsidering the special case human evolution. Across primates as a group, the course explores and integratescomparative evidence from anatomy, physiology, behavior, chromosomal studies, and molecular genetics.Both living primates and their fossil relatives are covered, with due reference to theoretical aspects. Particularemphasis is given to evaluation of characters for inference of evolutionary relationships and to explicitexamination of scaling effects of body size in between-species comparisons. Within the general framework oforigins and adaptations of primates, human evolution is examined with respect to all features covered. Specialfeatures of humans are identified and related to an overview of the hominid fossil record. A specific goal of thiscourse is to guide students to read, interpret, and synthesize scientific literature, and exercise critical thinkingwith respect to selected topics.

Students who wish to study abroad during that quarter must meet with theDirector of Undergraduate Studies no later than the beginning of their third year to work out an alternativeprogram of study.•At least two research papers of 10–15 pages. See Research Papers below.In all of the above cases, graduate seminars at the 40000-level may count toward requirements in the major.Students are advised, however, that such courses impose special burdens of time and expertise, and admission tothem is typically only by explicit approval of the instructor and may involve various prerequisites.Students wishing to pursue honors in the major have additional requirements, described below underHonors.Special FieldThe Special Field is developed by the student in consultation with instructors and the Director ofUndergraduate Studies, and may take various forms. It may be defined with reference to a civilization, achronological period, a nation-state, a cultural institution, or a suitable combination; it may be conceptual incharacter (e.g., art and the history of science, urban history, geography, gender and sexuality studies); it maycombine historical, critical, and theoretical perspectives (e.g., politics and visual art in the twentieth century); itmay be based in a particular medium or class of object (e.g., the built environment, tomb assemblages, or prints);it may combine historical and studio-practice courses (e.g., DoVA, CMST, TAPS, Music) to explore interrelations(e.g., art and dance). In many cases, courses outside the Department of Art History will be directly relevant tothe Special Field; up to two such courses may be counted toward the major as free electives to complement theSpecial Field.For those writing a BA Paper, the topic normally develops from the Special Field and allows for furtherstudy in the Special Field through independent research and writing.A proposal for the Special Field, in the form of a written petition, must be received by the Director ofUndergraduate Studies and approved no later than the end of a student's third year. It is strongly recommendedthat students complete at least two courses in their Special Field by the end of their third year. The SpecialField Declaration Form is available on the Department of Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/major-requirements).Junior Seminar0 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History is designed to introduce the methods of art historicalresearch. It is offered in Winter Quarter and required of art history majors; if they wish, minors may take thecourse to satisfy a 20000-level course requirement. Majors or prospective majors who wish to study abroadduring Winter Quarter of their third year must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies, preferably intheir first or second year and no later than the beginning of their third year, to work out an alternative programof study. Second-year art history majors are permitted to enroll in the Junior Seminar with permission from theinstructor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies.Research PapersAll art history majors write at least two research papers of 10–15 pages. Students who wish to write a BAPaper should complete this requirement before the beginning of their fourth year. A research paper can be:112         Art History•a paper written to fulfill a course assignment,•the extension of a shorter course paper (either during the course or after its completion) to meet thepage requirement, or•a new paper on a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor.The paper should include an analysis of existing scholarship and other relevant source materials. The papershould also draw on that scholarship and evidence to shape and support a thesis or argument of the student'sown devising. Formal analyses of works of art and analytic papers on materials assembled by the instructor donot qualify. On completion of a research paper, students must submit an approval form, signed by the courseinstructor, to the Director of Undergraduate Studies. It is the student's responsibility to obtain this signature andto submit the form. Approval forms are available on the Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/major-requirements).HonorsArt history majors who wish to pursue a BA with honors must complete the following requirements inaddition to the standard curriculum. These students must register for the BA Paper writing seminar (ARTH29800 Senior Seminar: Writing Workshop) in Autumn Quarter of the fourth year. Writing the BA Paper is aprocess that usually takes more than two quarters. Each student must secure the consent of an art history facultymember who will serve as his or her adviser by the second week of Autumn Quarter (i.e., two quarters beforethe planned quarter of graduation). Working with a preceptor, students must then complete a BA Paper by thesecond week of Spring Quarter of the fourth year. The BA Paper is typically a 20- to 30-page research paper oforiginal work that grows out of the Special Field. For more information, see BA Paper and Seminar.To be eligible for honors in the major, students must complete both the BA seminar and the BA Paper, andmust have earned a major GPA of at least 3.5 and cumulative GPA of 3.3 at the time of graduation. Please notethat completion of the BA Paper does not, in itself, guarantee honors in the major.

Studentsin the Class of 2019 have the option of adhering to the new or to the old requirements. They should meet with the Director ofUndergraduate Studies to address their options and any questions or concerns.The minor in architectural studies combines course work in art history, which equips students to analyzethe form and changing history of the built environment in diverse cultures, places, and times, with up to threecourses on architectural or urban topics offered in any department. Thus the minor enables students to enrich arthistorical analysis with methods from other disciplines. A student might choose to minor in architectural studiesbecause the student is interested in the built environment—the inescapable setting of our lives—from a liberalarts perspective or because the student is considering applying to architecture school. The minor could representan interest distinct from the student's major or it could complement a major in the social sciences or humanitiesby exploring the material setting of history and social life or the context for works of literature, film, music, ordrama. It could equally complement a major in the sciences, such as medical fields, ecology, geology, physics, ormathematics.Prospective minors need to meet with the Department of Art History’s Director of Undergraduate Studiesbefore the end of the third year to discuss their interests and course plans and to obtain advice and approval.Together the student and the Director of Undergraduate Studies will fill out the Minor Program ApplicationForm listing the intended courses, which the Director signs. The student should download the form from the ArtHistory website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/architectural-studies) and submit the completed,signed version to his or her College adviser before the end of the third year.RequirementsThe minor in architectural studies requires a total of six courses at the 20000-level chosen in consultationwith the Director of Undergraduate Studies, all of which must either focus on the built environment or permitthe student to devote the assignments or papers to the built environment. A minimum of three courses mustbe in the Department of Art History. The additional three courses may be taken in art history or in otherdepartments or programs. Some of the programs that may offer relevant courses are geographical studies,visual arts, history, English language and literature, anthropology, and environmental studies. In one of thecourses, students also write one research paper of about 10 to 15 pages on a topic chosen with and guided by theinstructor, by individual arrangement at the start of the quarter (see Research Papers).Minors are strongly encouraged to take 0 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History, for which they would research andwrite an essay on a topic of their choice instead of preparing a BA Paper proposal. This option is particularlysuitable for minors interested in doing graduate work in architectural history.Graduate seminars at the 40000-level may count toward requirements. Students are advised, however, thatsuch courses impose special burdens of time and expertise, and admission to them is typically only by explicitapproval of the instructor and may involve various prerequisites.Contact the Director of Undergraduate Studies in art history if you have questions about whether a coursemay be counted toward the architectural studies minor.Courses in the minor may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors. Coursesin the minor must be taken for quality grades, and more than half of the requirements for the minor must be metby registering for courses bearing University of Chicago course numbers.Summary of Requirements for the Minor in Architectural StudiesThree (3) courses at the 20000-level in ARTH focusing on the built environment *300Three (3) courses at the 20000-level in ARTH or other departments focusing on the built environment300One (1) 10- to 15-page research paper written for one of the six courses in the minorTotal Units600*One of the courses may be 0 Junior Seminar: Doing Art History.

Junior Seminar: Doing Art History. 100 Units.The aim of this seminar is to deepen an understanding of art history as a discipline and of the range of analyticstrategies art history affords to students beginning to plan their honors papers or, in the case of students who areminoring in art history, writing research papers in art history courses. Students read essays that have shaped andrepresent the discipline, and test their wider applicability and limitations. Through this process, they developa keener sense of the kinds of questions that most interest them in the history and criticism of art and visualculture. Students develop a formal topic proposal in a brief essay, and write a final paper analyzing one or twoworks of relevant, significant scholarship for their topics.Instructor(s): P.

ARTH 2990,"0 Preparation for the BAPaper in Autumn or Winter Quarter to afford additional time for research or writing; this course is taught byarrangement between a student and his or her instructor. This course would be in addition to the 11 courses forthe major with honors.A polished draft of the BA Paper is due by Friday of ninth week of the quarter preceding graduation; thefinal version of the BA Paper is due Monday of second week of the quarter of graduation. Both the draft andfinal version of the BA Paper must be submitted in duplicate: one copy to the faculty advisor and the second tothe Director of Undergraduate Studies. Because individual projects vary, no specific requirements for the BAPaper have been set. Essays typically range in length from 20 to 30 pages, but there is no minimum or maximum.Students should consult their BA advisor regarding all details, including optimal length, of the BA Paper.The BA Paper is a substantial research paper that presents an original argument or develops originalevidence about an intellectual problem. The paper should demonstrate the student’s capacity to formulate aserious research problem, develop a clear thesis, and substantiate the thesis on the basis of careful analysis ofrelevant evidence and measured consideration of competing views. The originality of the BA Paper may lie inthe discovery of evidence, a new, critical analysis of familiar claims, or the synthesis of materials. In keepingwith guidelines set by the College, the Department of Art History only recommends papers that have earned thehighest grade to the master of the Humanities Collegiate Division for consideration of departmental honors.Double Majors and the BA PaperWhether or not a single BA Paper can satisfy requirements for a double major in art history and anotherprogram is decided by the department on a case-by-case basis. Students should consult with the Director ofUndergraduate Studies. The criteria on which the decision is based include:•the degree to which the resulting thesis is likely to speak from and to art history, even as it necessarilyspeaks from and to another field;•the feasibility of the proposed advising arrangements for the proposed joint thesis; and•the department's estimation of the student's track record for independent work that bodes well forwriting a successful thesis while navigating between two majors.Transferring CreditNo credit from Advanced Placement (AP) exams can be used in the major. Up to four courses taken outsidethe University of Chicago may be counted towards the art history major, contingent on approval by the College2018-2019 The College            113and Director of Undergraduate Studies. Students planning to take courses outside the University are urged toconsult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies as they formulate their plans. Students should also consultwith their College adviser to be sure that they understand the University’s procedures for transfer credit. Refer toTransfer Credit for more information.While studying abroad, students are encouraged to keep excellent records: they will be required to submitthe syllabus and all written work for each course in order to be considered for credit. Please note that somecourses may be approved by the College but not by the major.Students first apply for transfer credit from the College, and credit for courses taken as part of a Universityof Chicago–affiliated direct enrollment program is vetted by Study Abroad. When the credit has been approved,students petition the Director of Undergraduate Studies in writing for credit for the major. The petition mustinclude a cover letter with the title and description of the course, as well as the name and location of theinstitution. To the cover letter should be attached a syllabus and a written record of the work the student did forthe course. The Director of Undergraduate Studies will review the work for each course individually, determineif the course is applicable for credit in the major, and, if so, where that credit should be applied.Summary of Requirements for the MajorMAJOR: Standard CurriculumFour (4) courses approved to meet the distribution requirement *400Three (3) courses approved in a special field *300Two (2) courses approved as electives *2000 Preparation for the BA Paper in Autumn or Winter Quarter toafford additional time for research or writing.

Whenchoosing courses, students should refer to the worksheet available on the Art History website (https://arthistory.uchicago.edu/undergraduate/major-requirements). This form helps each student and the Director ofUndergraduate Studies monitor the student's progress in the program.In order to keep an accurate record of students' progress to graduation, students will need to regularlyprovide a copy of the updated major worksheet to their College adviser for processing.Recommendations for Art History MajorsQualified undergraduate students in art history may, with the express permission of the instructor, enrollin graduate seminars in the department. (These seminars are also open to non-majors with the same proviso.)For students interested in graduate study in art history, it is advantageous to have performed well in a graduateseminar while completing the BA.Students are urged to also pursue upper-level language courses. If a language course is relevant to astudent's Special Field, the student may petition the Director of Undergraduate Studies to count it towardelectives.114         Art HistoryThose planning to continue their study of art history at the graduate level are advised to achieve languagecompetency equal to at least two years of college study in French or German, or in the language(s) relevant forthe geographic region that corresponds to their primary area of interest.GradingArt history majors must receive quality grades in courses taken for the major. 0 Preparation forthe BA Paper is open for Pass/Fail grading with consent of the instructor. Art history courses elected beyondprogram requirements may be taken for P/F grading with consent of the instructor. All courses taken to satisfythe general education requirement in the arts must receive quality grades. Nonmajors may select the P/F gradingoption with consent of the instructor if they are taking an art history course that is not satisfying a generaleducation requirement. A Pass grade is given only for work of C– quality or higher.Minor in Art HistoryBeginning with the Class of 2020, art history minors will follow the requirements outlined below. Students in theClass of 2019 have the option of adhering to the new or to the old requirements. They should meet with the Director ofUndergraduate Studies to address their options and any questions or concerns.All art history minors are encouraged take at least one (1) course in art history at the 10000-level to fulfilltheir general education requirement in the arts. Although general education courses do not count for the minor,they are useful preliminaries to advanced work. It is, therefore, strongly recommended that students take sucha course as early as possible in their undergraduate careers. Note: Students considering the minor in art historyand seeking admission to a 10000-level ARTH course may identify themselves to the instructor in advance.The formula for requirements in the minor goes by the sobriquet “3-and-3”:•All art history minors take three (3) courses at the 20000-level to meet a distribution requirementwithin the department. These courses shall be selected in consultation with the Director of UndergraduateStudies. Courses should be selected for maximal geographical, chronological, cultural, and methodologicaldiversity, and for minimal overlap with the Special Field.•All art history minors take three (3) courses at the 20000-level in a Special Field. Students developthe Special Field in consultation with departmental instructors and the Director of Undergraduate Studies.Because Special Fields reflect the interests of individual students, they range widely in topic, approach, andscope. Reading courses with art history faculty may be used to pursue specific questions within a SpecialField. For more on the Special Field, see Special Field.In all of the above cases, graduate seminars at the 40000-level may count toward requirements in the minor.Students are advised, however, that such courses impose special burdens of time and expertise, and admission tothem is typically only by explicit approval of the instructor and may involve various prerequisites.In one of the courses, students also write one research paper of about 10–15 pages on a topic chosen withand guided by the instructor, by individual arrangement at the start of the quarter (see Research Papers).

How did the universe evolve from an early, almostuniform, state to the rich structure that we see at the present epoch? Where did the elements of the periodic tablecome from? How do stars, along with their systems of planets, form and how do they change with time? Doother life-bearing worlds exist? These questions have evolved over millennia, with answers now sought using themathematical, technological, and computational tools of modern astronomy.For students interested in examining fundamental questions through scientific study of the universe, theDepartment of Astronomy and Astrophysics offers several choices to explore. Options include general educationcourses, the minor program in Astronomy and Astrophysics (aimed at students not majoring in the sciences), andthe major program in Astrophysics, with both BA and BS tracks.General Education CoursesMany options are available for choosing two- or three-quarter sequences that will satisfy the generaleducation requirement in the physical sciences from among six courses numbered in the 12000s. These coursesare designed for students not majoring in the sciences and present a range of foundational topics, from the grandprinciples governing the universe and understanding its beginning, to the formation and evolution of stars andgalaxies, and the search for habitable extrasolar planets. All courses numbered in the 12000s include labs forengaging in astronomical inquiry through classical experiments, opportunities for telescope observing, and dataanalysis. The Study Abroad program in Paris is another option for completing the general education requirementin the physical sciences.Students seeking a more in-depth examination of selected astrophysical topics may take a course numberedin the 18000s as a third course in the physical sciences or as a general elective. While the 12000 and 18000 coursesare aimed at students not majoring in the sciences, quantitative analysis is an important part of all coursesoffered by the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Any tools beyond pre-calculus algebra will be taughtas needed.Major in AstrophysicsThe major program in Astrophysics reflects Chicago’s tradition of interdisciplinary study and emphasison mastery of the intellectual processes of inquiry and discovery. Courses in Computer Science and Statisticscomplement a foundational program in Physics, reflecting the essential relationships among the physicalsciences. Students will gain broad knowledge of the universal, physical laws from the nuclear to cosmological;familiarity with computational methods and statistical data analysis; and experience with experimental andobservational techniques through participation in research. Graduates of the Astrophysics program will bepositioned to pursue advanced degrees in physics, astronomy, or similar fields, or enter government service,science education, or scientific journalism.There are two tracks for students interested in the major. The program leading to a BA in Astrophysicsconsists of fifteen courses beyond the general education requirement. The program leading to a BS inAstrophysics consists of eighteen courses beyond the general education requirement. The BS track isrecommended for students expecting to apply to graduate school in the physical sciences.Please note that courses counted toward the major must be taken for quality grades (no P/F grading).Note: The 2018–19 academic year will be the first in which the major in Astrophysics is offered. In very particularcases, students in the Class of 2019 may be eligible to complete the major depending on how many requirements they havealready completed. Interested students should consult with the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and theirCollege adviser immediately to determine the possibility and a proper course of study moving forward. This in no wayguarantees that the major can be completed, however. Completion of the major for members of the Class of 2020 will alsobe contingent on the number of electives completed so far; these students should consult with the department as soon aspossible. Students in the Class of 2021 who took Physics (or Chemistry, if interested in the Chemistry Variant) in their firstyear will be able to enter the major.Summary of Requirements for the BA in AstrophysicsGENERAL EDUCATIO"

Using institutions across campus,the city of Chicago and beyond as our primary locus, we will explore curatorial and collecting strategiesemployed by a variety of visual arts institutions and platforms from the scale of the single-room/single curatorgallery, to the museum and the international biennial. We will consider how curatorial and exhibition-makingpractices have evolved from the latter half of the 20th century to the present day. We will consider the socio-cultural and political implications of curatorial work, and reflect on the shifting status of the art object withincollecting and non-collecting institutions. Together we will explore significant curatorial projects at a local,national and international level; we will undertake site visits as well as play host to visiting curators, artists andthinkers. Course readings will feature the writings of seminal international curators as well as selections fromhistorians and theorists in the field of curatorial studies. Students will work through a series of independent andcollaborative assignments as well as a final project that integrates curatorial theory and practice.Instructor(s): Y.

ARTH 1712,"1. The Art of Leonardo da Vinci. 100 Units.The central focus of this course will be on the small, damaged and disputed body of paintings that Leonardohas left to us, the wealth of his drawings that help us make sense of that problematic heritage and provide themost direct route into his creative thinking, and the hundreds of pages of text in the form of notes in mirror-image handwriting that comment on art and so many other subjects. Our structure will be roughly chronological,including his late fifteenth-century Florentine artistic and social context; his two long periods in Milan as a courtartist; his triumphant return to Florence and rivalry with the young Michelangelo; his brief and unsatisfying stayin papal Rome; and his final years in France. Among the themes that will be critically examined are: Leonardo'srole in the creation of what is still grandiosely called the High Renaissance; the value and problematic aspectsof thinking of him as the quintessential artist-scientist; the significance of the fact that he has been a figure ofsuch obsessive art-historical and broader cultural significance for over 500 years; and the ways in which recentscientific examination and digital imaging have shed surprising amounts of new light on his art. Through theconcentrated study of the works of Leonardo and his artistic context, the course will take seriously the attemptto introduce students with little or no background in art history to some of the major avenues for analysis andinterpretation in this field.Instructor(s): C.

Frank Lloyd Wright in Chicago and Beyond. 100 Units.This course looks at Wright's work from multiple angles, examining his architecture, urbanism, relationship tothe built environment and socio-cultural context of his lifetime, and legend. We'll take advantage of the RobieHouse on campus and the rich legacy of Wright's early work in Chicago; we'll also think about his later "Usonian"houses for middle-income clients and the urban framework he imagined for his work ("Broadacre City"), as wellas his Wisconsin headquarters (Taliesin), and spectacular works like the Johnson Wax Factory (a required one-day Friday field trip, if funds permit), Fallingwater, and the Guggenheim Museum. By examining on architect'swork in context, students will gain experience analyzing buildings and their siting, and interpreting them in lightof their complex ingredients and circumstances.

Photography And Film. 100 Units.This is a core course that serves as an introduction to the history of art by concentrating on some fundamentalissues in the history of photography and film. The course is divided roughly in half between still photographyand film. The central theme of the course concerns the way in which photographs and films have beenunderstood and valued during the past 165 years. There have been profound changes in attitudes and beliefsregarding the nature of photographs throughout the history of photography (this is likewise true of film). Thecurrent range of views is very different from those held by the various audiences for photographs and filmsin the last century and the century before. For instance, photographs were originally conceived of as copies ofthings that can be seen, but the notion of copy was drawn from a long-established set of views about what makesa picture a work of art and copies were said to be incapable of being works of art. This view continues to hauntthe writings of some critics and historians of photography and film. The course will concentrate on the workof photographers, theorists of photography and film, and on films by John Huston, Billy Wilder, and RomanPolanski.Instructor(s): J.

Students are accordingly asked to study a varietyof historical periods in order to develop their abilities as readers, to discover areas of literature that theymight not otherwise explore, and to develop their knowledge of literary history. To meet the periodrequirement in English, students should take at least one course in each of the following:One English course in literature written before 1650One English course in literature written between 1650 and 1830One English course in literature written between 1830 and 1940One English course in literary or critical theory. Courses fulfilling this requirement are designated in ourcourse listings.NOTE: Many courses satisfy several requirements. For example, a gateway course could also satisfy agenre requirement, or a course on Chaucer could satisfy the genre requirement for poetry and the pre-1650requirement. The description for each English course includes the distribution areas the course is eligible tosatisfy. For details about the requirements met by specific courses, students should consult the Student AffairsAssistant.Cluster StatementThe purpose of the Cluster Statement is to help students organize and give coherence to their individualprogram of study. Students will design a cluster of at least five courses that share a conceptual focus. By theend of the third week in Spring Quarter of their third year, students should submit a Cluster Worksheet andone-to-two-page statement to their departmental advisor and then the Student Affairs Assistant outlining theirinterests in the field and designating a “cluster” of at least five courses. Up to two of these courses may be fromdepartments outside English. Students will design a personalized cluster that falls under one of the followingfour general rubrics: (1) literary and critical theory, (2) form/genre/medium, (3) literature in history, (4) literatureand culture(s). Students may include Creative Writing courses within their clusters.

ARTH 2301,"5. Ornament and Islamic Art. 100 Units.Intricate patterns, luxurious materials, the absence of human figures: in the western imagination ornament andIslamic art are synonymous. This class will interrogate why, even after decades of scholarship to the contrary,the rhetoric of ornament and Islamic art persists. What does it mean to call a work of art-and by extension anentire culture-ornamental? This class positions ornament as a critical lens and explores how western ideas aboutthe role of ornament shaped, and were shaped by, the study of Islamic artworks. In locating the ornamentalhistory of Islamic art, we will confront legacies of imperialism and orientalism, interwoven with politics oftechnology, representation, and design. Islamic ornament once inspired artists and fueled early art historians.But the seeds that had been sown in the nineteenth century bore quite a different fruit in the twentieth, andmodernism's explicit rejection of the ornamented surface pushed Islamic art from center stage to the periphery.We will consider foundational works of Islamic art and architecture (including textiles, carpets, metalwork,ceramics, arts of the book, calligraphy, and examples of mosque and palace architecture) and analyze the ways inwhich they have been imagined by European and American artists, theorists, and historians.

Weapons were adorned like jewelry, while armor could imitate thefashion of the finest silks. This seminar will study the material remains of this culture of conflict and pageantryas it influenced technology, costume design, architecture, visual culture, the art of the book, and especiallymetalwork in medieval and early modern Europe. Themes include the pageantry of tournaments, the art ofheraldry, the visual culture of war-its glories and miseries, the image of noble princes, music, the birth of martialart manuals, fashion on the battlefield, fortification technology and the engineer. With a focus on object-basedstudy, lectures will analyze the collections at the Art Institute of Chicago including: armor, edged weapons,textiles, prints, rare books and many other facets of this martial culture. Students will be encouraged to engagewith this cultural history of warfare and pageantry as it relates to their own fields of interest and explore thebroad and definite impact of conflict on the arts of design.Instructor(s): Staff Terms Offered: AutumnNote(s): Students must attend first class to confirm enrollment.

The Advanced Workshop is the characteristic pedagogical instrument of CreativeWriting as an academic discipline. Workshop practice relies on an understanding of support that is dedicated toimproving students’ writing, not unconditional approval. Critique is the core value and activity of the workshop,and students will practice it under the guidance of the workshop instructor. Although Advanced Workshopsbegin with attention to exemplary texts, they typically focus on original student work. See Enrolling in CreativeWriting Courses for additional details.Credit for a Beginning Workshop: Students who have completed a Beginning Workshop in their primarygenre and have received a grade of B+ or above will be able to count this course as one of the required AdvancedWorkshops. Because students must take at least two Advanced Workshops in their primary genre, any qualifyingBeginning Workshop may only serve as the third required workshop. This means that students choosing to counta Beginning Workshop towards the major will not be able to count an Advanced Workshop from a genre thatis not the primary genre towards the degree.

The Body and Embodiment in Ancient Greek Art. 100 Units.Whether naked or clothed, male or female, mortal or divine, the body takes pride of place in the visual worldsconstructed by ancient Greek artists. Yet this emphasis on depicting the body begs the question: What is a bodythat exists as an image? What, in other words, is a body that is not embodied? This problem, articulated alreadyin our ancient sources, serves as the starting point for this course's investigation of the relationship betweenimages of the body in Greek art and the experiences such images solicited from their viewers. It examines, onthe one hand, how Greek art promoted the body as a social construct--through artistic practices that configuredthe body's appearance, like distinctive techniques, styles, and iconography; through conceptual categories thatascribed identities, like gender, class, and race; and through contexts that integrated depictions of the bodyinto lived experience, like sanctuaries, cemeteries, and domestic settings. But we will give equal attention to theviewer's subjective experience of embodiment, including its sensorial and affective dimensions, and the waysin which that experience is negotiated and articulated as a function of works of art. Finally, we will turn to thelegacy of the Greek body in more recent centuries and consider its enduring impact as a visual paradigm today.Instructor(s): S.

In what ways does literature deal with ethical and politicalissues concerning nonhuman animals? What does it mean to live in a multicultural and multispecies world?What does it mean to be "human"? In this course we will ask these and other related questions as they arepresented and represented in Italian 20th century literary texts, read alongside philosophical writings, scholarlyessays, and visual materials. While maintaining a focus on Italian literature, a comparative approach involvingliterary works of non-Italian authors will be key in understanding the pervasiveness of the problems that havecaused our detachment from nature and our broken relationship with nonhuman animals. We will closelyanalyze and critically evaluate the works of several authors, including those by Italo Calvino, Primo Levi, AnnaMaria Ortese, Elsa Morante, Italo Svevo, Alice Walker, and Franz Kafka, giving particular attention to techniquesof close reading. A thematic approach will enable us to explore a large number of critical discourses, from themoral status of nonhuman animals to the long-held assumptions regarding the anthropocentric set of valuesthat have defined (Western) culture. We will also take into consideration different theoretical frameworks suchas posthumanist theory and gender studies in order to discuss and evaluate the selected texts from differentperspectives and entry points.Instructor(s): E.

Imagining Private Life in Early Modern China. 100 Units.This course examines how artists, poets, moralists, politicians, and philosophers painted, sang about, orlegislated private life in early modern China. The paintings, poems, and documents we examine will allow us topeer deeply into the private lives of people speaking as intellectuals, monks, lovers, married couples, or parents.In addition to such private objects as pillows, mirrors, or personal fans, we'll also look at paintings about privatematters intended for viewing in public. To prepare us for this voyeuristic voyage, we will read modern studiesof early modern family life in China by historians, sociologists and anthropologists, as well as primary legaland philosophical arguments written in classical and early modern China. We will also read some primary andsecondary materials relating to private life in early modern Europe. Students will acquire a basic understandingof moral, political, and legal issues relevant to the conduct of private life at the time. Along the way, studentswill learn the fundamentals of conducting social history research using primary materials, including visualart. We will view works at the Art Institute of Chicago as part of the class. Requirements include regular classparticipation, short class presentations, a longer presentation, and a final paper based on the longer presentation.Graduate students will be expected to write longer papers utilizing more advanced research methods, includingthe use of primary languages.Instructor(s): M.

Theories of Media. 100 Units.This course will explore the concept of media and mediation in very broad terms, looking not only at moderntechnical media and mass media, but at the very idea of a medium as a means of communication, a set ofinstitutional practices, and a habitat in which images proliferate and take on a "life of their own." The course willdeal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television andvirtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle'sPoetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, andFriedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is amedium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensoryexperiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the "unmediated" or "immediate"? How do mediabecome intelligible and concrete in the form of "metapictures" or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflectson itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one mediumfrom another, and how do they become "mixed" in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recentfilms such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality.Instructor(s): W. J. T.

Framing, Re-framing, and Un-framing Cinema. 100 Units.By cinema, we mean the art of the moving image, which is not limited to the material support of a flexible bandcalled film. This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to newmedia and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels andreassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the mostradical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between theOpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving imagefor more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologiesto explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrialforces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use newcomputer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developedfor and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching,analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless ofprevious programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture.Equivalent Course(s): 0, 0, 5"

Ways of Curating and Collecting. 100 Units.This seminar takes stock of contemporary currents in curating and collecting practices at a time when we areexperiencing rapid expansion of the museum sector internationally, and witnessing the growing ubiquity of"curation" within the spheres of leisure, culture, entertainment and tourism. Using institutions across campus,the city of Chicago and beyond as our primary locus, we will explore curatorial and collecting strategiesemployed by a variety of visual arts institutions and platforms from the scale of the single-room/single curatorgallery, to the museum and the international biennial. We will consider how curatorial and exhibition-makingpractices have evolved from the latter half of the 20th century to the present day. We will consider the socio-cultural and political implications of curatorial work, and reflect on the shifting status of the art object withincollecting and non-collecting institutions. Together we will explore significant curatorial projects at a local,national and international level; we will undertake site visits as well as play host to visiting curators, artists andthinkers. Course readings will feature the writings of seminal international curators as well as selections fromhistorians and theorists in the field of curatorial studies. Students will work through a series of independent andcollaborative assignments as well as a final project that integrates curatorial theory and practice.Instructor(s): Y.

ARTH 2742,"0. Modernist Architecture on Campus. 100 Units.How have universities brought modern architecture into campuses designed in traditional architectural styles,whether classical or medieval? How have they balanced architecture's capacity to exemplify a consistentinstitutional image and to symbolize innovative leadership? Can the two be integrated, whether in singlenew buildings, renovations of old buildings, or groupings of old and new? What effect do new buildingmaterials, methods, and technologies, as well as new purposes for buildings, have on these questions? Whileacknowledging other institutions, the course will focus on our own campus history, examining varied approachesto updating our collegiate Gothic campus architecture and layout from the construction of Levi Hall (theAdministration Building) in the 1940s to the present. We will analyze buildings and campus plans in relationto the abundant and largely unstudied drawings and related building documents at Special Collections, andwork together to interpret the histories we produce in the context of the broader, changeful history of modernistarchitecture and its debates.

Erotically charged melodramas and comedies were the most popular genres, but also poeticmasterpieces such as The Passion of Joan of Arc are key works from this era. The course will explore thebreathtaking appearances of such celebrated female stars as Asta Nielsen and Greta Garbo, and analyze silentmasterpieces such as Blom's early science fiction films, the dramas of Christensen, Stiller, Sjostrom, and Dreyer,and the early films of Tancred Ibsen and Ingmar Bergman.

It will explore historical and theoretical issues related to the mutual interactionsbetween cinema and theatre also discussing cinematographic techniques in playwriting as exemplified in playsby Henrik Ibsen (e.g. Peer Gynt) and August Strindberg (e.g. A Dream Play and The Ghost Sonata). Throughoutmost of his creative career Bergman worked both in theatre and film and even if he is mostly known outside ofSweden as a film director, his theatrical career was as innovative. The work of the film-auteur and the theatredirector are for Bergman closely connected, not only through the actors he worked with - during summers forthe screen and during the theatre seasons in stage productions - but also through the choice of themes, whichare often in direct dialogue with each other in the two media, generating complex meta-aesthetic, inter-medialdiscourses, depicting and problematizing the work and role of the artist in a broad range of social and ideologicalcontexts.

ARTH 2881,"5. World's Fairs, 1851-1937: Chicago and Paris. 100 Units.The great era of world's fairs (or universal expositions) lasted about ninety years. Although this golden ageoriginated in London and took expression on every continent, two of its most significant hosts were Paris andChicago. This course will examine the character and impact of expositions in these two cities, concentrating onParis expositions held between 1855 and 1937 and the two Chicago fairs of 1893 and 1933. Particular attentionwill be given to the art, design, and architecture featured, stimulated, and sometimes ignored by the fairs. Buttechnological, racial, political, institutional, and social themes will be examined as well. This colloquium is meantto encourage creation of research papers. It will meet once a week and there will be heavy reliance upon imagesat each session.Equivalent Course(s): "

Dimensions of Citizenship: The Venice Architecture Biennale 2018. 100 Units.In conjunction with the US pavilion at the 2018 Venice Architecture Biennale - co-commissioned by theUniversity of Chicago and co-curated by Professor Niall Atkinson - this Gold Gorvy Traveling Seminar willexplore the multiple relationships between architecture and citizenship both in contemporary practice and inhistorical perspective. The course will be centered around the pavilion's theme of architecture and citizenship atseven spatial scales: Citizen, Civic, Region, Nation, Globe, Network, Cosmos. Through these scales, students willengage critically with the works of participating artists, architects, and designers, works that address the spatialdimensions of belonging in contemporary society. Students will also explore the historical dimensions citizenshipthrough Venice's complex history as a globally connected maritime empire that incorporated multiple linguistic,ethnic, and religious communities. Finally, the seminar will take account of the politics of national display atthe root of the biennale itself and the relationship between historical and contemporary spatial experiences ofcitizenship and rights of abode, belonging and exile, migration and refuge, and the design of liminal spaces suchas ships, ports of entry, quarantine centers, and ghettoes as places of agonistic cultural exchange.Instructor(s): N.

The Politics of Memory in Modern France. 100 Units.Most of a nation's past is forgotten, and even momentous, heroic, or villainous events fade from memory withina generation or two. Governments, organized groups, and individuals often do not agree about what shouldbe remembered and what forgotten, nor is there consensus concerning appropriate forms of and audiences forcommemoration. Does everyone see commemorations the same? How effective is naming of a street sign or amétro stop? Do people see statues or just walk past? Is it legitimate to shock with graphic representations ofviolence? What memorial work do histories, novels, poems, films, and museums do? We will analyze French,starting with the heart of state commemoration-the Pantheon-where those deemed of the highest national serviceare interred. Next, we focus on revolution, such as the Place de la Bastille column, the Mur des Fédérés, or theSorbonne amphitheater, occupied in 1968. Regarding WW2, while the government and civil society acceptedresponsibility for the deportation and murder of some 76,000 Jews quite late. There are now, however, numerousmonuments to their lives and deaths across Paris. Concerning France's imperial past, we will focus on debatesover remembering metropolitan France's long and fraught relationship with North Africa and North Africans.Our approach will be multidisciplinary: secondary readings will be drawn from anthropology, sociology, andhistory, and primary sources will include poetry, novels, memoirs, film, and site visits.Instructor(s): L.

Along the way, students present their research to variousgroups, including Astronomy and Astrophysics faculty, for feedback and discussion.Minor in Astronomy and AstrophysicsThe grand narrative of astronomy holds wide popular appeal and lends itself to interdisciplinary study:there is a deep history and cultural context, the night sky is profoundly inspiring and accessible to everyone, andthe spirit of exploration is communicated in daily media reports of new discoveries. The minor in Astronomyand Astrophysics was designed for students not majoring in the sciences to cultivate understanding of science asa human endeavor across multiple social, historical, and cultural contexts, and to develop comprehension of thequantitative reasoning that supports a deep conceptual understanding of science.Students are allowed flexibility in selecting five courses to compose a rigorous program of study accordingto individual interest. The selection must include at least two courses numbered in the 12000s and at leastone in the 18000s. It is possible for a student pursuing the minor to substitute a course numbered in the20000s for one of the 18000 courses. Students interested in exploring this option must meet with the academicaffairs administrator to discuss course selection. Please note: courses taken to satisfy the general educationrequirement in the physical sciences may not be counted towards the minor.

The faculty of the College believe that a sound knowledgeof biology is essential for understanding the world in which we live, engaging many pressing problems facinghumanity, and becoming a part of their eventual solution. The Biological Sciences Collegiate Division, therefore,provides a variety of general education courses for all College students—prospective biologists and non-biologists alike. Although most of the course offerings beyond the introductory year are designed to serve theneeds of students majoring in biological sciences, many of these courses are well suited to students in otherareas who wish to study some aspect of modern biology in greater detail. Courses on the ethical and societalimplications of the biological sciences, for example, are of interest to many non-majors. For prospective biologistsand medical professionals, our curriculum offers in-depth course work at all scales of life, from complexecosystems to organisms to the molecular mechanisms operating in subcellular compartments.Academic HonestyAcademic dishonesty is a matter of grave concern to the faculty of the Biological Sciences Collegiate Divisionand will not be tolerated. Students should become familiar with the guidelines presented in Doing HonestWork in College by Charles Lipson and consult with each of their instructors to make sure they understand thespecific expectations of each course. Consequences of academic dishonesty (including plagiarism) may result insuspension or expulsion from the University.The General Education Requirement in the Biological SciencesStudents choose one of the following options to meet the general education requirement in the BiologicalSciences:1.a two-quarter general education sequence for non-majors; or2.The Pre-Med Sequence for non-science majors; or3.0 Advanced Research inChemistry or one year of 0.

The BA and BS degrees in chemistry are designed to providea broad foundation in the three principal branches of the science: inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry.Analytical chemistry, often regarded as an independent branch, is incorporated into the program. Both curriculadiscuss experimental and theoretical work and emphasize their interdependence. Both degree programs preparethe student for a career in chemistry. However, the BS degree offers a more intensive program of study. TheBA degree also offers thorough study in the field of chemistry, but it provides a wide opportunity for electivefreedom and for the pursuit of interdisciplinary interests in areas such as biochemistry, biophysics, chemicalphysics, geochemistry, premedicine, and education.Program RequirementsThe principal distinction between the BA and BS programs is the number of chemistry courses required.Program Requirements: BA A minimum of eight courses in chemistry beyond the general educationrequirement (which should be taken in the first year) is required for the BA degree.Program Requirements: BS A minimum of twelve courses in chemistry beyond the general educationrequirement (which should be taken in the first year) is typically required for the BS degree.Summary of Requirements: BA in ChemistryGENERAL EDUCATIO"

The Course Cluster Initiative (https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/college-course-clusters) is designed to continue the thematic focus andmultidisciplinary perspective of the general education curriculum; to expose students to ideas from the vantagepoint of different disciplines across the humanities and the social, physical, and biological sciences; to stimulateand cultivate the student’s intellectual curiosity and sense of academic adventure; and to help students structuretheir electives without imposing programmatic strictures and limiting the freedom of intellectual exploration.Course clusters consist of three or more courses on a common topic or issue that are offered over a span oftwo to three years. Course clusters can be made up of existing courses or encourage the creation of new courses.Courses within a cluster can have different formats. They can be smaller seminars or larger lecture courses.The only prerequisite is that they have no prerequisites and not be designed primarily for minors/majors (eventhough they can count towards major requirements).Please review the College Course Clusters page (https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/college-course-clusters) for updated information regarding the Course Cluster Initiative, including courses belonging to eachcluster.The following are examples of course clusters currently offered:Climate Change, Culture, and SocietyThe planetary scale of anthropogenic climate change challenges us to reassess many central questionsin the humanities and social sciences from justice and power to truth and art. This course cluster encouragesstudents to explore the problem of climate change from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Courses in history,political science, classics, English, philosophy, and other disciplines from the social sciences and the humanitiescomplement courses in the physical and biological sciences. In addition to learning about the science of climatechange in the latter, the former will ask a host of questions: What were the historical roots of fossil fuel use?What can the human past teach us about our ability to cope with climate change? How will we ensure justice andhuman rights in the face of a threat that affects poor people and future generations disproportionately? In whatways might literature and art help understand and communicate climate change, and shape our sense of agencyand hope in facing an uncertain future?Economic History, from Sumer to the Global WorldThe course cluster "Economic History, from Sumer to the Global World" will propose every year up to threecourses in economic history. We wish to cover a broad time span and a wide range of cultures. The courses willput a special emphasis on the methodology of economic history. The students will thus also be able to acquire adeep knowledge of the questions that are currently debated in this field.History of the LawThe development of law and legal systems is one of the defining hallmarks of societies from antiquity tothe present. Abundant written evidence survives from the societies of the ancient Mediterranean, the NearEast, South Asia, and East Asia. This cluster of courses will include deep dives into individual legal systemsknown from ancient societies in Greece, Rome, Babylonia, Assyria, Israel, Egypt, China, and India, as well ascomparative investigations informed by historical and anthropological literatures.InequalityThe problem of inequality has been an abiding concern in the social sciences and humanities. In recentyears it has attracted heightened attention and inspired scholarly innovation, fostering real ferment among thoseseeking to understand the mainsprings of the modern world. To understand such an abiding aspect of socialand cultural organization requires a broad set of analytical resources and intellectual perspectives. Drawingon a range of methodologies, students will trace and examine the sources and challenges of inequality andmobility in many of their dimensions, selecting from courses in economics, history, political science, gender andsexuality studies, public policy, and other disciplines across the divisions. The broad, considered lens offeredby this approach will allow students in the cluster to understand more fully the dynamics and consequences ofinequality in modern culture and society, and its roots in persistent patterns of distribution of wealth, income,education, and social and other kinds of capital.Urban DesignUrban design concerns the proactive effort to create human settlements of a particular character and quality.The study of urban design is an opportunity to evaluate the difference between ideal and actuality, gaining anunderstanding of what urban designers are trying to do and why and evaluating the reasons behind apparentsuccesses and failures. Students will explore the history, theory, and practice of urban design from multipleperspectives, from historical surveys to more contemporary investigations of urban interventions and theireffect on social change, in courses offered through art history, geographical studies, history, anthropology,sociology, comparative human development, and other disciplines from the social sciences and humanities.Whether urban design is capable of balancing social equity, aesthetic achievement, economic growth, and842         Course Clustersenvironmental stewardship is of key interest within the field, practice, and study of urban design. How do weleverage meaningful public engagement in the urban design process? How do we balance individual expressionand a sense of the collective? Students will engage with these fundamental problems in diverse contexts acrossthe cluster.2018-2019 The College            843Signature Courses in the CollegeSignature Courses are intended to introduce College students to exciting themes, ideas, and materials inthe humanities and social sciences. They afford unique and memorable learning experiences, exemplary ofhumanistic inquiry.They are designed as gateway courses that open up fields and disciplines for further exploration. Thus,Signature Courses have no prerequisites and are open to all College students. While they are conceived asgeneral elective courses, they may count towards departmental major and minor requirements.Please refer to the College Signature Courses page (https://college.uchicago.edu/academics/college-signature-courses) on the College website for the most up-to-date information about Signature Courses beingoffered.844         Stevanovich Institute on the Formation of KnowledgeStevanovich Institute onthe Formation of KnowledgeDepartment Website: https://sifk.uchicago.edu/coursesThe Stevanovich Institute on the Formation of Knowledge unites scholars from a variety of fields to studythe process of knowledge formation and transmittal from antiquity to the present day and, in correlation,to explore how this history shapes the modern world. By rigorously exploring the underlying influences onwhat is accepted as true, the institute aims to understand the basis of human values and provide insights intocontemporary issues.The institute's Faculty and External Faculty Group are committed to investigating all aspects of the processesby which cultures claim to know what they know. Where are the boundaries between knowledge and belief?What techniques do cultures deploy to encode and verify information, and how do technological developments—in forensics and measurement, for example—impinge on these areas? What awareness do societies showregarding what is contingent about their deepest commitments? These questions may be put historically andcross-culturally. They also need urgently to be posed about those who work in notionally rational moderninstitutions, such as the university and the lab.The Stevanovich Institute joins these faculty with fellows at every stage of the career from graduate andpost-graduate to senior visiting scholars, in the context of the extraordinary resources of the University ofChicago, to question and enrich each other, in conversation about the past, present, and future of humanknowledge.KNOW courses are offered by the faculty (https://sifk.uchicago.edu/directory-page) and fellows (https://sifk.uchicago.edu/directory-page/postdoctoral-fellows) of the Stevanovich Institute on the Formation ofKnowledge at both the graduate and the advanced undergraduate levels. Courses are cross-listed with a varietyof departments, so students can enroll in them as a major course with their department's course number or as anelective with the KNOW course number.For undergraduate funding opportunities, events, and up-to-date course listings, visit sifk.uchicago.edu.XCAP: The Experimental CapstoneIn addition to its regular KNOW courses, and as an unprecedented experience in undergraduate teaching,the Stevanovich Institute on the Formation of Knowledge will be offering, XCAP: The Experimental Capstone,with one new class debuting each quarter of 2018–19.These team-taught courses are for fourth-year students onlyand will challenge them to build upon their University of Chicago educational experience by adding practice,impact, and influence as important dimensions for undergraduate education.XCAP courses will incorporate a variety of topics and frameworks, but inherent in each of these courses arethe following three elements:1.an element of practice, a result in a product, or a measurable impact;2.an appeal to students from all the College divisions for maximal interaction of different points of view;and3.a part of the college experience with particular relevance to post-college life.All XCAP courses will be team-taught by faculty from different divisions or schools and will involve two orthree faculty or postdoctoral fellows. Students may take one, two, or all three courses as they wish. Admissionwill be by application, and a cohort of no more than 15 will be selected.For details see the Stevanovich Institutewebsite: https://sifk.uchicago.edu/courses/xcap/.Stevanovich Institute on the Formation of Knowledge Courses"

Christian Traditions and Medicine in the Late Modern World. 100 Units.The course rests on the assumption that contemporary challenges in medicine stem from a moral pluralismreflecting the cultural conditions of late modernity, as well as from a growing inability to maintain clinicalexcellence in an increasingly complex and bureaucratic health care system. Throughout American history,Christians have often worked toward cultural change in various vocational spheres in order to align theirpractices in the world toward a religious and spiritual ideal. This course will explore a theological foundationfor a different paradigm of active cultural engagement in medicine and bioethics. First, students will examinetraditional Christian accounts both of medicine and of moral formation, to consider how they might informanswer to the question, How does one become (and remain) a good physician? Students will study sacredtexts, traditions, and practices of Christianity to search for moral, spiritual, conceptual and practical resourceswithin the tradition that physicians might draw upon to recover ways of practicing medicine as a vocation,as a sacred calling. Second, students will examine the empirical literature from vocational psychology onwork motivation, focusing particularly on the construct of calling and its application to the pursuit of clinicalexcellence in medicine. Third, students will also examine recent research in the field of moral psychology that isshaping contemporary views regarding moral and professional formation and identity. Lastly, after surveyingthe contemporary challenges in medicine through the above interdisciplinary analyses, students will explorevarious Christian theological perspectives that attempt to re-imagine what "faithful presence" might entail in thecurrent vocational sphere of medicine. Students will explore the diverse theological perspectives of Catholicism,Protestantism, and Eastern Orthodoxy and bring them to bear on the following questions: "What religiousand spiritual resources does their Christian tradition bring to bear on the challenges and opportunities in thevocational sphere of medicine and bioethics? What would it mean to exhibit a "faithful presence" in medicine"?What it might mean for the institutions that shape medicine to truly enhance the communities in which theylive?"Instructor(s): John Yoon Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): 5. The Making of the "Good Physician": Virtue Ethics and the Development of Moral Character inMedicine. 50 Units.This multi-disciplinary course draws insights from medicine, sociology, moral psychology, philosophy, ethics andtheology to explore answers to the unique challenges that medicine faces in the context of late modernity: Howdoes one become a "good physician" in an era of growing moral pluralism and health care complexity? Studentswill engage relevant literature from across these disciplines to address issues regarding the legitimate goals ofmedicine, medical professionalism, the doctor-patient relationship, vocation and calling, the role of religionin medicine, and character development in medical education.

Nazis began a cinematic documentation of WWII at its onset, positioningcameras in places of actual atrocities. Documentary footage produced was framed by hostile propagandisticschemes; contrary to this 'method', Holocaust feature films are all but a representation of Jewish genocideproduced after the actual traumatic events.

Because of this challenge, Holocaust films raisequestions of ethical responsibility for cinematic production & a search for relevant artistic means with which toengage post-traumatic representation. Therefore, among major tropes we will analyze voyeuristic evocation ofdeath & suffering; a truthful representation of violence versus purported necessity of its cinematic aesthetization;intertwined notions of chance & hope as conditions of survival versus hagiographic representation of victims.The main goal is to grasp the potential of cinema for deepening our understanding of the Holocaust, the coursesimultaneously explores extensive & continuous cinematic production of the genre & its historical developmentin various European countries, to mention the impact of censorship by official ideologies in the Soviet Union,Poland, Hungary, & Czechoslovakia during the Cold War.Instructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: WinterNote(s): Course requirements: film screenings, class participation, reading assignments, one class presentation,and a final project.

David Bergelson's Strange New World. 100 Units.Born in a shtetl in Kiev province in the Pale of Settlement in 1884, Bergelson began writing in Hebrew andRussian before switching to Yiddish, although his Yiddish always retained the trace of other languages. Helived through the First World War and the Russian revolution and civil war, and survived Hitler, but not Stalin,who had him executed for "nationalism" in 1952. "Yiddish" and "shtetl" may suggest a self-enclosed communityof pious Jews, celebrating their rituals in an annual cycle. In Bergelson's world, however, time is out of joint.Anachronism, belatedness, and untimeliness, both joyful and tragic, unfold as an emotional, sensory, andexistential condition in the world his fiction creates and the world in which he lived. For Bergelson Yiddish is thevehicle for questions about time, history, justice, art, and bodily experience. This course provides an introductionto Bergelson's novels and short stories, from his earliest writing to his Holocaust works.Instructor(s): Harriet Murav Terms Offered: SpringEquivalent Course(s): "

Soviet Science Fiction. 100 Units.In the Soviet Union, science fiction played an integral part in intellectual debates about the best way to engagewith the new realities of the twentieth century. This literary and cinematic genre was thought capable ofreinventing the lives, realties and even beliefs of the Soviets. This course will study the cultural, historical, andpolitical contexts of science fiction from the Soviet Union through literature such as Evgenii Zamiatin's dystopiannovel We (the inspiration for George Orwell's 1984), Ivan Efremov's The Andromeda Nebula (1956), and thework Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, as well as through films such as Iakov Protazanov's Aelita (1924), the firstSoviet science fiction film, along with later imaginings of space travel such as Pavel Klushantsev's Road to theStars (1957), and Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris (1972)-a mysterious, human drama set in space. The primary goalof the course is to study how Soviet writers and filmmakers utilizes science fiction to interpret and/or commentupon their present historical moment?

The Intelligentsia: On Slavic Social Thought. 100 Units.Isaiah Berlin described the notion of the Intelligentsia as "arguably Russia's greatest contribution to worldcivilization." But just how culturally specific-or, alternatively, universal-is that concept? Many of the chieftheoretical concerns of the Intelligentsia (the role of the public intellectual in society, the expression of dissidenceand the ethics of exile) have preoccupied thinkers since Socrates. What distinguishes the Intelligentsia from othermodels of public intellectualism? How have various Slavic public intellectuals maintained, or broken with, thistradition? In order to establish a theoretical vocabulary, the course will begin with an introduction to severalclassical and contemporary theories of the role of the intellectual in society. We will then ground our inquiry inthe historical invention of the Russian Intelligentsia during the mid-19th Century before setting off to analyzeits 20th and 21st-century manifestations. Throughout the course, our main goal will be to examine the ways inwhich these thinkers conceive of and perform the role of a "public intellectual." How do they balance the tasks ofdocumenting and participating in the historical events they describe? What strategies do they utilize in order torelay their intellectual activity to a larger public? What do they consider to be the responsibility of intellectuals?Equivalent Course(s): 6.

While Stravinsky makes use of oral tradition andfolk culture, our other examples will be drawn from classic literary works, primarily from the 19th century. Wewill integrate close textual readings with focused analyses of the musical pieces, while devoting considerableattention to contexts of composition and reception. Throughout, we will be concerned with cultural and socio-political events from the mid-19th century to the fall of Soviet Union-events that colored the performance andinterpretation of these works and often set the tone for their composition as well.Equivalent Course(s): "

CMST 2453,"0. Cowboys and Tramps in Film and Literature. 100 Units.The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw the invention of two distinctly American literary archetypes: thecowboy and the hobo. Based on historical conditions of labor, economics, and westward expansion, the cowboyand the hobo, though both itinerant workers primarily employed seasonally in agriculture and ranching, weredepicted very differently in literature and, later, film, during the decades in which they held influence overAmerica's imagination and mythologization of itself. Evoking responses from fear to admiration and pity toenvy, the cowboy and the hobo, both as historical figures and as fictional types, reflected the evolving realitiesof-and the broad range of attitudes toward-labor, masculinity, and place in a modernizing America. This coursewill examine literary and cinematic representations of hoboes, tramps, cowboys, and gunslingers from the late1800s to the mid-1900s, tracing their historical and cultural contexts. We will address pulp and dime novels aswell as literary masterpieces, stage plays, poems, and feature films from the silent and sound eras, paying specialattention to the effects of different media and art forms on the depiction and mythologization of these figures.Other themes include violence and the state, the American West, technology (trains, automation in agriculture,weapons), immigration and migration, race, and material culture.

Signs of the Americas. 100 Units.It is a common misconception that literature can happen only in the alphabet or that such non-alphabeticalliteratures have long ago ceased to be made. This course corrects such misconceptions by exploring modernand contemporary literatures that have been written with, or in response to, such sign-systems as pictographs,hieroglyphs, totem poles, wampum, and khipu. Focusing especially on the sign-systems of the native Americas,this class gives students a basic introduction to the mechanics of these signs, in order to discuss how thesemechanics might be at play in the works of such poets, writers, and artists as Anni Albers, Simon Ortiz,Gerald Vizenor, Louise Erdrich, John Borrows, Charles Olson, Bill Reid, Robert Bringhurst, Fred Wah, ClaytonEshleman, Cy Twombly, Joaquín Torres-Garcia, Cecilia Vicuña, and others. Key questions to be asked include:how are these signs an interface for contemporary histories of nation and capital? And: how do those materialhistories and their identifications in race, gender, kinship, and ecology change when cast in the mechanics,tropes, and figures of these signs?

The connection between cinema and symbolism was not surprising insofar as symbolism was adominant aesthetic paradigm throughout Europe at the time. However it does suggest (perhaps surprisingly)that from the very beginning cinema was seen as a means of visualizing the non-rational, uncanny and eveninvisible. This course examines the relationship between symbolism and cinema with particular attention toFrench and Russian writings and films. Examining how symbolist aesthetics became applied to the cinematicmedium, we will pay particular attention the resources it provided for conceptualizing the uncanny and themystical. We will question whether there exists a distinct symbolist tradition in film history and how it relatesto notions of poetic or experimental cinema.

While this course touches uponthe early history of television, we will focus our attention on the era between the commercialization of televisionin the United States (in the early 1950s) and the rise of internet-based television via services such as Hulu (inthe 2000s). As we will see, the history of television in these years, intersects with numerous other media, suchas radio, film, video, digital games, and the novel. Alongside a study of the medium of television and its role inAmerican culture, we will attend carefully to the form of TV narrative as it changes from an early episodic formatto the complex long-form serial narratives that attained maturity in the 1990s.

This art reaches back to early devices to trick the eye into seeing motion and looks forward to newmedia and new modes of presentation. With the technological possibility of breaking images into tiny pixels andreassembling them and of viewing them in new way that this computerized image allows, we now face the mostradical transformation of the moving image since the very beginnings of cinema. A collaboration between theOpenEndedGroup (Marc Downie and Paul Kaiser), artists who have created new modes of the moving imagefor more than decade, and film scholar Tom Gunning, this course will use this moment of new technologiesto explore and expand the moving image before it becomes too rigidly determined by the powerful industrialforces now propelling it forward. This course will be intensely experimental as we see how we might use newcomputer algorithms to take apart and re-experience classic films of the past. By using new tools, developedfor and during this class, students will make new experiences inside virtual reality environments for watching,analyzing, and recombining films and that are unlike any other. These tools will enable students, regardless ofprevious programming experience, to participate in this crucial technological and cultural juncture.Equivalent Course(s): "

Thiscourse will look at how these media work: the history of their development, the changes they have brought aboutin a broader media culture, their political implications, and their social status and significance (e.g., the placethey occupy in culture, the kinds of interactions they make possible). The focus will equally be on the ways inwhich cinema has responded to the changing digital landscape, which will be explored through both blockbusterand experimental films as well as video and web-based art. Readings will be taken from the history of filmtheory, recent work in media history and archeology, and theoretical studies of digital media and technology.Instructor(s): D.

Introduction to Videogame Studies: Art, Play, and Society. 100 Units.This course is intended as an introduction to the study of videogames in the humanities. Topics includevideogame form (visual style, spatial design, sound, and genre); videogames as a narrative medium;embodiment and hapticity in videogame play; issues of identity/identification, performance, and access relatedto gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity, ability, and class; and rhetorical, educational, and political uses ofvideogames. Just as the videogame medium has drawn from older forms of art and play, so the emerging fieldof videogame studies has grown out of and in conversation with surrounding disciplines. With this in mind,readings and topics of discussion will be drawn both from videogame studies proper and from other fields in thehumanities - including, but not limited to, English, art history, and cinema and media studies.

For a final project, students will plan and produce footage for an individual or small group shortfilm. The first half the class will be highly structured, with demonstrations, in-class shoots and lectures. As thesemester continues, class time will open up to more of a workshop format to address the specific concerns andissues that arise in the production of the final projects. This course is made possible by the Charles Roven Fundfor Cinema and Media Studies.Equivalent Course(s): 1, "

Motion Pictures in the Human Sciences. 100 Units.This course will examine the relationship between moving images, particularly motion-picture films, and thehuman sciences, broadly construed, from the early days of cinema to the advent of functional magnetic resonanceimaging (fMRI). It will use primary source documents alongside screenings to allow students to study what themoving image meant to researchers wishing to develop knowledge of mind and behavior, and what they thoughtfilm could do that still photography and unmediated human observation could not. The kinds of motion pictureswe will study will vary widely, from infant development studies to psychiatric films, from documentaries toresearch films, and from films made by scientists or clinicians as part of their laboratory or therapeutic work toexperimental films made by seasoned filmmakers. We will explore how people used the recordings they madein their own studies, in communications with other scientists, and for didactic and other purposes. We will alsodiscuss how researchers' claims about mental processes-perception, memory, consciousness, and interpersonalinfluence-drew on their understandings of particular technologies.Instructor(s): A.

The purpose of the BA paper is to enable students to improve their research and writing skills and togive them an opportunity to focus their knowledge of the field upon an issue of their own choosing.In their third year, by Monday of eighth week of Spring Quarter, students must submit to the director ofundergraduate studies a short statement proposing an area of research. The statement should include an abstractof a paragraph or more, outlining the problem that you wish to tackle and sketching the argument you hope toelaborate in response. You can, if you wish, discuss questions of method or earlier scholarship. You should makereference here with as much specificity as possible to the primary sources on which you will draw to substantiateyour claim.The statement must be approved in writing by a member of the Classics faculty who agrees to be thedirector of the BA paper. In certain cases, students may have two co-chairs, including one member of the Classicsfaculty and one faculty member from another department. Classics faculty at the level of associate professorand above may advise up to three BA papers, while assistant professors may advise as many as two papers.Students needing assistance in finding a faculty member with whom to work should consult with the director ofundergraduate studies.Students may register for 0 BA Paper Seminar in either Autumn or Winter Quarter of theirfourth year, but they are expected to participate in seminar meetings throughout both quarters. The focus ofthe seminar is to discuss research problems and compose preliminary drafts of their BA papers. Participantsin the regular seminar meetings are expected to exchange criticism and ideas with each other and with thepreceptor, as well as to take account of comments from their faculty readers. The grade for the BA Paper Seminaris identical to the grade for the BA paper and, therefore, is not reported to the Registrar until the paper hasbeen submitted in Spring Quarter. The grade for the BA paper depends on participation in the seminar aswell as on the quality of the paper. At the end of Autumn Quarter, a provisional grade will be assigned by thepreceptor and communicated to the student via the director of undergraduate studies. Once the BA paper hasbeen submitted, the final grade will be determined jointly by the preceptor and faculty director.The deadline for submitting the BA paper in final form is Friday of third week of Spring Quarter. This deadlinerepresents the formal submission, which is final; students should expect to submit and defend substantial draftsmuch earlier. Both hard copies and digital copies are to be submitted to the faculty director, seminar preceptor,and director of undergraduate studies, unless otherwise indicated. Students who fail to meet the deadline maynot be able to graduate in that quarter and will not be eligible for honors consideration.Students who undertake a double major may meet the requirement for a BA paper in Classical Studies bymaking it part of a single BA paper that is designed to meet the requirements of both majors. This combinedpaper must have a substantial focus on texts or issues of the classical period, and must have a Classics faculty220         Classical Studiesmember as a reader. 0 BA Paper Seminar (the two-quarter BA Paper Seminar) is required of allstudents majoring in Classical Studies, whether as a double major or as a single major.

The fellowshipis targeted to third-year undergraduates who are bound for graduate school, and it provides means andopportunity for the writing of a superior research paper on any aspect of the ancient world from the Bronze Agethrough Late Antiquity. It may be used for travel to classical sites and collections or to other research centers,and/or for living expenses during a summer devoted to research between the third and fourth year. Applicantsmust submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8, 2019) a transcript, a statement (2–3 pages) outliningtheir project and its relationship to existing knowledge in the field, a plan of research together with a provisionalbudget for the summer, and a letter from a faculty supervisor. A written report of what was accomplished duringthe period of the fellowship must be submitted to the director of undergraduate studies by the first week of thefollowing Autumn Quarter.This fellowship is not limited to Classical Studies majors and minors, or even to students of Greek and Latin, andalthough it may be used for research abroad, it does not require such research. But it does require that a student have a well-developed research project by the time of application.The David Grene Fellowship is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The fellowship is targeted toundergraduates whose intellectual interests in the classical world have led them to an area of knowledge whichthey are unable to pursue during the regular academic year, and it allows them an opportunity to explore thatinterest through independent study during the summer before graduation. The independent study may involvetraining in a new discipline such as paleography or numismatics, first-hand experience of ancient sites andartifacts, or ancillary language study. It may be carried out under the auspices of an organized program like theAmerican School of Classical Studies at Athens or the American Academy in Rome, or it may be tailored entirelyaccording to the student's own plan. Applicants must submit to the Classics Secretary (by Monday, April 8,2019) a transcript, project statement (2–3 pages), a provisional budget, and a faculty letter of recommendation. Awritten report of what was accomplished during the period of the fellowship must be submitted to the director ofundergraduate studies by the first week of the following Autumn Quarter.This fellowship is not limited to Classical Studies majors and minors, or even to students of Greek and Latin, and itneed not directly involve the study of classics, but applicants must be able to demonstrate a background of interest in theclassical world.The Pausanias Summer Research Fellowship is expected to be worth $5,000 this year. The fellowshipprovides support to an undergraduate student in Classical Studies for research abroad in sites of interest forclassical studies.

The grant is given to astudent of Greek or Latin who has been accepted to participate in the Athens Program or the Rome Program ofthe College, and it is to be used to defray costs incurred in the program. The terms of the grant stipulate that it isto be awarded to a "needy and deserving" student. Students who have been accepted into one of the programsand who wish to be considered for the Shorey grant are invited to submit statements explaining their need in thefirst week of Spring Quarter.The Classics Prize is a cash award of $500 made annually to the student who graduates with the best recordof achievement in the Classical Studies major.Examples of past successful application statements for the summer awards are available from theundergraduate prize coordinator, Peter White, (https://classics.uchicago.edu/faculty/white) or the director ofundergraduate studies, Sofia Torallas Tovar (https://classics.uchicago.edu/faculty/tovar).Offered through the Society for Classical Studies (SCS):The Lionel Pearson Fellowship seeks to contribute to the training of American and Canadian classicists byproviding for a period of study at an English or Scottish university. The competition is open to students majoringin Classics, or closely related fields. Fellows must undertake a course of study that broadens and develops theirknowledge of Greek and Latin literature in the original languages; candidates should therefore have a strongbackground in the classical languages. Normally, the recipient will hold the fellowship in the academic yearimmediately after graduating with a bachelor’s degree. The term of the fellowship is one year. The recipientmay use the fellowship for part of a longer program of study, but under no circumstances will support from thefellowship extend beyond one year. Fellows are responsible for seeking and obtaining admission to the Englishor Scottish university where they intend to study.The maximum amount of the fellowship will be $24,000, which may be used to offset academic fees, travelexpenses, housing and subsistence costs, and book purchases. The fellowship amount ($24,000) is the maximumthat the SCS can award, but the Faculties of Classics of both Oxford and Cambridge Universities have generouslyoffered to support the tuition expenses of any Pearson Fellow enrolled at their institution. In these instancesfunds provided by the SCS should be adequate to offset the fellow’s other expenses, and the SCS will attempt(but it cannot guarantee) to obtain a similar accommodation from another institution in the UK should the fellowattend a university other than Oxford or Cambridge. Note: The SCS cannot guarantee tuition support from otherFaculties at Oxford and Cambridge (such as Philosophy or History). Students should be aware that if they canpursue their preferred course of study under the rubric of Classics, it would be to their advantage.Candidates for the fellowship require nomination by the director of undergraduate studies by the end of theSpring Quarter for a rising fourth-year student. The Department of Classics may only nominate one student, andtherefore requests that interested students submit the following materials by Friday of eighth week in the SpringQuarter of their third year:•A current copy of your transcript•One paragraph on why you would like to be nominated for the Pearson Fellowship, briefly suggestingwhat you might like to do with it. This should include which university or universities you are interestedin attending, with whom you would like to work, and what kind of topic you would like to research and/orwhy you think a year doing so in the UK would be especially beneficial for you.See more information at https://classicalstudies.org/awards-and-fellowships/lionel-pearson-fellowship. 2018-2019 The College            223Classical Civilization Courses0-10200-10300.

(The departmental website lists the office hours of the director of undergraduate studiesand the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies.)The intensive track is designed to acquaint students with the problems and methods of philosophy in moredepth than is possible for students in the standard major. It differs from the standard program mainly by offeringthe opportunity to meet in the following very small discussion groups: the intensive track seminar in the AutumnQuarter of the third or fourth year (0Elementary Logic (or approved alternative course in logic)100One of the following:300One from field A and two from field BTwo from field A and one from field 0Elementary Logic (or approved alternative course in logic)100One of the following:300One from field A and two from field BTwo from field A and one from field BSix additional courses, at least one of which must be in the Department of Philosophy *600Total Units1200*Only one of these courses may be satisfied by participation in the BA essay workshop.The Senior EssayStudents who have been admitted to the intensive track are required to write a senior essay (also calledthe “BA essay”). Standard majors and philosophy and allied fields majors may also apply to write an essay.The proposal should be formulated in consultation with a faculty adviser who has expertise in the topic area.Potential advisers can be approached directly, but the assistant to the director of undergraduate studies canhelp pair students with suitable advisers as needed. BA essay applications are due middle of Spring Quarter.Applications are available from the shelves outside the Philosophy Department office (Stuart 202) as well as onthe wiki (https://coral.uchicago.edu:8443/display/phildr/Philosophy+Undergraduate+Wiki).Students writing a BA essay in philosophy are normally expected to have maintained a GPA of 3.25 in theirphilosophy courses. A 3.25 is also the minimum GPA for departmental honors in philosophy. Students shouldsubmit, along with their application to write a BA essay, a record of their grades in the College. If a student whowishes to write a BA essay in philosophy has a GPA in philosophy courses below 3.25, the student should alsosubmit a petition in writing to the Director of Undergraduate Studies.In their fourth year, students writing BA essays must participate in the senior seminar. The seminar runsall three quarters, and though attendance during all three is required, participants will only register for two ofthe three quarters. Students should register for 0. Elementary Logic. 100 Units.An introduction to the concepts and principles of symbolic logic.

Can you have precisely the correct amount of fear and still fail to becourageous? Could you be courageous if you weren't afraid to die? Courage is, arguably, the queen of the virtues.In this class, we will use some Socratic dialogues (Laches, Protagoras, Republic, Phaedo) and some Aristoteliantreatises (Nicomachean Ethics, Eudemian Ethics) as partners in inquiry into the answers to the questions listedabove.

Paris Noir: African American Refuge in the City of Light. 100 Units.This course explores the phenomenal history of Paris as a place of refuge for people of African descent, focusingespecially on black Americans during the middle decades of the 20th century. Beginning in the years whenthe US Jim Crow regime was being consolidated and continuing through the era of the civil rights movement,when that regime was being contested, black Americans considered Paris a place of refuge. Novelists, musicians,and sports and political figures all found opportunity for creativity and freedom of expression in the "city oflight," notwithstanding the fact that France had itself been one of the principal slave powers in the Americasand remained a major colonial empire--all of which complicated its image of racial liberalism. How both Frenchpeople and African American sojourners negotiated that apparent contradiction will be the principal issuesaddressed in course readings and discussions, which will focus on political activists like W .E. B. Du Bois andBlack Panther member Elaine Brown; literary figures like Richard Wright and James Baldwin; and sports andentertainment personalities like Jack Johnson and Josephine Baker.

CLCV 2401,"7. The Spartan Divergence. 100 Units.Sparta was a Greek city, but of what type? The ancient tradition, or at least the larger part of it, paints the portraitof an ideal city-state. The city was supposed to be stable and moderately prosperous. Its citizens were allegedlymodels of virtue. For many centuries the city did not experience revolutions and its army was invincible on thebattlefield. This success was attributed to its perfect institutions. Following the track opened by Ollier's SpartanMirage, modern scholarship has scrupulously and successfully deconstructed this image of an ideal city. Butwhat do we find if we go beyond the looking glass? Was Sparta really a city "like all the others"? This class willshow that we must go deeper into our evidence in order to make sense of the extraordinary success followed bythe brutal collapse of this very special city-state.Equivalent Course(s): "

Mediterranean Islands: Odd and Insular Histories. 100 Units.Islands, and Mediterranean islands in particular, have long provoked curiosity and intrigue, and have persistedas places for thinking about utopia, incongruity, distinctiveness, or backwardness since antiquity. This courseinterrogates the representations of islands in ancient thought as well as their own archaeological and historicalrecords in order to trace their often elliptical categorization in modern scholarship. Are islands unique becausethey are isolated, or rather because they become crossroads of interaction? From the mythical island of theCyclopes, to the Aegean archipelagos, to the large masses like Sicily or Cyprus, discussions will exploreapproaches to insularity, isolation, connectivity, and identity using a wide range of textual and material evidenceand theoretical insights from geography, anthropology, history, literature, and environmental science.Instructor(s): C.

CLCV 2601,"1. Ancient Views of the Economy. 100 Units.The ancient economy is a topic that for a long period had fallen into neglect. But for a few years it hasexperienced an exceptional revival in the field of ancient studies. This is why it is time to revisit classical authorsand examine what they can tell us on the economic world they were living in. Starting with Herodotus, movingon with Thucydides, Ps-Iamblichus, Xenophon, Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, Livy and Cicero, this course willprovide a general outlook of what the writers of the Classical and Hellenistic period (for Greece) or Republicanperiod (for Rome) can teach us on the topic. It will show certain continuities between some of them but will alsobe explicit on the vivid debates that could oppose others. Beyond the economic paradigm, it will also provide anew approach to a series of ancient authors.Instructor(s): A. Bresson Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): 7. Gods and God in Imperial Asia Minor (1-300 CE) 100 Units.Roman Asia Minor in the Imperial period provides an extraordinary case of religious plurality and creativity.Pagans, Jews, Christians, even already Christian heretics, interacted in the same space. The frontiers betweenJewish and Christian communities were, at least at the beginning, more fluid than was long thought. But even thefrontiers between paganism and Judaism or Christianity were certainly not as rigid as was later imagined. Thisdoes not mean, however, that there were no tensions between the various groups. This class will examine thevarious aspects of this religious diversity as well as the social and political factors that may explain the religiousequilibrium prevailing at that time in Asia Minor.Instructor(s): A.

We will focus on affinities betweenChristianity and the classical tradition as well as ways in which the Christian faith may be considered radicallydifferent. Some of the more important issues that we will analyze are: 1. "The spell of Homer." How the Homericpoems exerted immeasurable influence on the religious attitudes and practices of the Greeks. 2. The theme ofcreation in Greek and Roman authors such as Hesiod and Ovid. The Orphic account of human origins. The EarlyChristian theme of Christ as creator/savior. 3. Greek and Roman conceptions of the afterlife. The response to theHomeric orientation in the form of the great mystery cults of Demeter, Dionysus, and Orpheus. The views of thephilosophers (esp. Plato). The New Testament conception of resurrection. 4. Greek and Roman conceptions ofsacrifice, the crucifixion of Christ as archetypal sacrifice and early Christian reflection upon it. 5.

Topics will include: the analysis of poetry in terms of mimesis and image; poetry-makingas an exercise of craft, divine inspiration, or some other sort of knowledge; the emotional effect on the audience;the role of poetry in forming moral character and, more broadly, its place in society; the relation between poetry,rhetoric, and philosophy; aesthetic values of beauty, wonder, truth, and grace.

We willexamine not only what women actually did and did not do in these societies, but also how they were perceivedby their male contemporaries and what value to society they were believed to have. The course will focus onhow women are reflected in the material and visual cultures, but it will also incorporate historical and literaryevidence, as well. Through such a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, we will examine the complexitiesand ambiguities of women's lives in the ancient Mediterranean and begin to understand the roots of modernconceptions and perceptions of women in the Western world today.Instructor(s): M.

Was there an "Urban Revolution," and how did it start? What various physical forms did citiesassume, and why did cities physically differ (or not) from each other? What functions did cities have in differentcultures of the past, and what cultural value did "urban" life have? How do past perspectives on cities comparewith contemporary ones?

This makes their testimony ofgreat importance for literary history and interpretation, but that testimony does not come without problems. Inthis course we will cover some of the concepts and techniques needed to recover the literary treasure containedin this highly complex material: from the history of book forms, the textual tradition of literary works, and thecreation of the canons to more philological aspects such as editorial practice, Textkritik, and paleography. Ourliterary corpus will include biblical texts, paraliterary (school and magical) texts, and translations of Egyptiantexts into Greek. We will work with photographs of the papyri, and every part of the course will be based onpractice.

The study of human development also offers a uniquelens through which we consider broad questions of the social sciences, like the processes and impacts of socialchange, and the interactions of biology and culture. Faculty members in Comparative Human Development withdiverse backgrounds in anthropology, biology, psychology, and sociology conduct research on topics that include(but are not limited to): the social and phenomenological experience of mental illness; comparative education;the impact of socioeconomic context on growth and development; the influence of social interaction on biologicalfunctioning; the tensions inherent in living in multicultural societies; the experience and development ofpsychotherapists in Western and non-Western countries; and the ways in which youth in developing countriesare forging new conceptions of adulthood. Given this interdisciplinary scope, the program in ComparativeHuman Development provides an excellent preparation for students interested in advanced postgraduatestudy at the frontiers of several social science disciplines, or in careers and professions that require a broad andintegrated understanding of human experience and behavior—e.g., mental health, education, social work, healthcare, or human resource and organizational work in community or corporate settings.AdvisingThe first point of contact for undergraduates is the preceptor. Preceptors can be emailed at humdev-preceptors@lists.uchicago.edu. Additional contact information for the year-specific preceptor can be found inContacts at the bottom of this page, along with the undergraduate chair and administrator contact information.Electronic CommunicationUpon declaring a Comparative Human Development major, undergraduates should promptly jointhe department undergraduate email listserv to receive important announcements.

Those following the Long Paperpath, described below, must complete eight courses while those on the BA Thesis path must complete at leastsix. It may be appropriate for advanced students to pursue an independent study credit (see below). Coursesoutside Political Science may be considered for the major only by petition. (Please submit the General Petitionform (http://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) (college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) along with a copy of the course syllabus to Pick 406.)Writing Requirement: Two OptionsStudents who are majoring in political science must write at least one substantial paper. There are two waysto meet this requirement, by writing a BA Thesis or by submitting a Long Paper.Option 1: Long PaperThe Long Paper is typically a course paper. It may be written for either a professor in Political Science or aprofessor in another department whose course is accepted for Political Science credit. Students who write a LongPaper are not required to write a BA Thesis. Students submitting a Long Paper must bring an approval formto the departmental office signed by an instructor who verifies that the paper meets two requirements: (a) the640         Political Sciencepaper is twenty pages or longer, double-spaced (that is, approximately 5,000 words or longer); and (b) the paperreceived a grade of B or better (that is, a grade of B- or below does not meet the requirement).The Long Paper might be:•A class paper for any course used to meet the major's requirements.•An extended version of a shorter paper written for a course. If a course requires a shorter paper,students may ask the instructor for permission to write a twenty-page paper instead.•Written for a course that did not require any papers. Students may ask the instructor for permission towrite a twenty-page paper, either in place of another assignment, as an extra assignment, or as an ungradedassignment.•Written for a Political Science instructor after a course is completed. The student could either producean entirely new paper or, with the instructor's permission, take a shorter assignment and turn it into a longerpaper.If the paper is not a graded assignment for class, it still meets the department's requirement if the instructorattests that it merits a grade of B or better. Unless the paper is written for a graded class assignment, studentsmust ask the instructor's permission to submit any such paper.Students are responsible for obtaining an approval form (political-science.uchicago.edu/sites/political-science.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Long Paper Form.pdf) to verify the successful completion of the LongPaper from the department office and giving it to the relevant instructor. Please ask the instructor to sign theapproval form and return it to the departmental office. The deadline for submitting the approval form (http://political-science.uchicago.edu/sites/political-science.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/Long%20Paper%20Form.pdf)and the paper is 4 p.m. on Friday of the second week of the quarter in which the student expects to graduate.Students should complete their paper before their final quarter; the approval form should be submitted to thedepartmental office as soon as the writing requirement is completed.Option 2: BA ThesisWriting a BA Thesis will meet the writing requirement in Political Science and may also qualify a studentfor consideration for honors; see sections below for more information. In either case, the paper is typically fromthirty-five to fifty pages in length (the length of most scholarly articles in professional journals). It must receivea grade of B or higher. Students choose a suitable faculty member to supervise the research and writing.

The Practice of Social Science Research. 100 Units.This is a first course in empirical research as it is practiced across a broad range of the social sciences, includingpolitical science. It is meant to enable critical evaluation of statements of fact and cause in discussions of thepolity, economy, and society. One aim is to improve students' ability to produce original research, perhaps incourse papers or a senior thesis. A second objective is to improve students' ability to evaluate claims made byothers in scholarship, commentary, or public discourse. The specific research tools that the course developsare statistical, but the approach is more general. It will be useful as a guide to critical thinking whether theresearch to be evaluated, or to be done, is quantitative or not.

Substitutes for this course are 2 Social Structure and Change, from any 30000-level courses in sociology that have not beencross listed with undergraduate course numbers. Students may also count graduate courses (e.g., 40000-level orhigher) in which they may enroll with permission of course instructors toward this requirement.Courses outside of sociology must be approved by the undergraduate program director. Students mustsubmit the College's General Petition Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) forreview. With a few exceptions, courses offered in the Division of the Social Sciences are accepted. Other courseswith significant social science content or special relevance to a student’s BA thesis may also be accepted.Area of Specialization. At least three of the additional courses in sociology or related fields, outlinedabove, must comprise a self-defined area of specialization. Students will declare a specialization whichreflects an emphasis of their course work and BA thesis research. Students in the Class of 2019 and beyondare required to develop a specialization; students in the Classes of 2017 and 2018 may elect to do so.Students are encouraged to consider their specialization from the time that they enter the programin order to guide their selection of courses and prepare them for the substantial research project of the BAthesis. Students formally propose their specialization at the start of their penultimate quarter of residence(ordinarily, this will be due in January of the student’s fourth year). The proposal should include a themewith three (or more) courses in sociology or related fields that students have completed or are completingwithin that domain. These proposals are to be submitted on the College's General Petition Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/advising/forms-and-petitions) and must be approved by the undergraduate programdirector.

Invitation to Sociology. 100 Units.What do sociologists do all day? This course introduces students to the vast terrain of contemporary sociology,including: culture, deviance, economic life, education, family, health and the body, politics, population,professions, race, science and knowledge, and sex/gender, employing institutionalization as a basic lens thatleads sociology to have a somewhat different approach from other social sciences. Why an invitation? Unlikeintroductory courses that cover 10 topics in 10 weeks with an emphasis on foundational texts, students willget to know sociology by reading and analyzing a rotating selection of books and articles that exemplify thefield today. Students will complete exercises and write-ups that link claims about the social world to evidence.Throughout the quarter, class format takes a variety of forms, including lectures, informal presentations, student-led discussions, debates, and guest speakers.Instructor(s): J. Martin and J. Trinitapoli Terms Offered: Spring1. Sociological Methods. 100 Units.This course introduces the philosophy and practice of social research. Working from the idea that the researchprocess is fundamentally a critical dialogue, we begin by exploring questions of causality and the epistemologyof social research. Then we turn to examine the basic practices that are a component of all methods of socialresearch through an in-depth examination of interviews, ethnography, surveys, and archival research.Assignments culminate in a research proposal for the BA thesis.Instructor(s): R. Vargas Terms Offered: SpringNote(s): Required of students who are majoring in Sociology2. Social Structure and Change. 100 Units.The title of this course is traditional more than it is descriptively accurate. It should be called How to ThinkSociologically. Rather than attempt to survey the state of the field as introductory courses typically do, this courseadvances a particular vision of the discipline. We will be reading authors that fundamentally inform this vision(not all of whom were sociologists proper), including Durkheim, Weber, Simmel, Garfinkel, Goffman, Geertz,Levi-Strauss, Mauss, Bourdieu, and Fanon. We will learn how to identify properly sociological objects and howto engage in various modes of sociological analysis. We will discuss social facts, forms, types, and relations; thecollective nature of social reality, social identities such as race and gender, and social class. We may even get totalk about social structure and change. The course has been designed to provide students majoring in sociologya more solid-although, again, a very particular-disciplinary foundation. The readings fill the gap between theclassical sociology covered in the social science cores Self and Power and the contemporary sociology covered byother departmental offerings.Instructor(s): M.

Another student might havea strong interest in literary study and wish to address general, generic, and/or transnational questions that gobeyond the boundaries of national literature offered in other literature departments. Or, a student might wishto pursue an in-depth study of the interrelationship of literature and culture, as well as issues that transcend thetraditional demarcations of national literary history and area studies.These descriptions of academic interest are not mutually exclusive. Each student will work with the Directorof Undergraduate Studies to design a plan of course work that will suit his or her individual goals and that willtake advantage of the rich offerings of the University.Program RequirementsThe requirements outlined below are in effect as of Autumn Quarter 2018 and will apply to all studentsin the Class of 2020 and beyond. Students in the Classes of 2018 and 2019 may request to switch to the newrequirements if the updated program suits their interests and fits within their graduation plans.Students interested in applying to the major in Comparative Literature should review the followingguidelines and consult with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Comparative Literature. These guidelinesare to assist students in developing a balanced and cohesive interdisciplinary plan of study.The major is comprised of seven literature courses selected in consultation with the Director ofUndergraduate Studies, one foundational course in comparative literary theory and methodology, two courses inliterary theory, methods, or special topics in Comparative Literature, and a BA project workshop that serves as acapstone to the major.A student works with the Director of Undergraduate Studies to identify a primary field (four courses) andsecondary field (three courses). A student wishing to work in two literatures might choose two literatures asthe primary and secondary fields (note: the second literature can be English). The secondary field might be aparticular national literature or a portion of such a literature (e.g., poetry, drama, novel); another discipline (e.g.,mathematics, history, film, performance studies, music); or literary theory.Study abroad offers an attractive means of fulfilling various aims of this program. More than half of themajor requirements must be satisfied by courses bearing University of Chicago numbers.Summary of RequirementsThree foreign language courses at the intermediate level or above (See Foreign Language Requirement fordetails)300Four courses in a literature other than English, one of which can be in a closely related field400Three courses in a secondary field, which can be literature in another language (including English),another discipline (e.g., mathematics, performance studies, music), or literary theory300"

CMLT 2980,"1B.A. Project and Workshop: Comparative Literature (See BA Project fordetails)100Total Units1400Foreign Language RequirementThe Comparative Literature major requires three language courses in a single language at the intermediatelevel or above. Students who come in with advanced proficiency in a language other than English may insteadsubstitute three courses in a third language, at any level. Though students must demonstrate proficiency throughat least the second-year sequence in a foreign language, they are encouraged to continue their language studybeyond the minimum required for the major. The Department of Comparative Literature works closely withthe University of Chicago Language Center and will help students achieve their individual goals in languageacquisition by suggesting programs of study that will add to their language expertise as appropriate.BA ProjectThe BA capstone project is to be completed in the student's last year of study. The project should beapproved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and is supervised by a faculty member of the student'schoice in Comparative Literature. It may be co-advised by a faculty member from another department. Students248         Comparative Literaturemust complete their formal application to the major by spring of third year and should identify a faculty advisorat that time.One obvious choice for a BA project is a substantial essay in comparative literary study. This option shouldnot, however, rule out other possibilities. Alternative examples are a translation from a foreign literature withaccompanying commentary or a written project based on research done abroad in another language and culturerelating to comparative interests. Students are urged to base their project on comparative concepts and tomake use of the language proficiency that they will develop as they meet the program's requirements. Visitcomplit.uchicago.edu/undergraduate for more details on the BA project.This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major ifcertain conditions are met and with approval from both program chairs. Students should consult with the chairsby the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of third year, when neither program publishes a deadline).A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the College adviser. It must be completed andreturned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student's year of graduation.Participation in the ProgramStudents should express their interest in the major as early as possible. The first step is to meet with theDirector of Undergraduate Studies to consult about a program of study. Applicants must submit an applicationform which consists of a list of completed courses and a list of courses in which they are currently registered.Special mention should be made of language courses or other language training that affirms a student's level oflanguage proficiency. Each proposal will be evaluated on the basis of the interest of the student and his or herachievement in the languages needed to meet the goals of the intended course of study. Students will be notifiedby email of their acceptance to the program. Finally, students will need to formalize their declaration throughmy.uchicago.edu with the assistance of the College adviser.Comparative Literature majors should demonstrate literary proficiency in a language (other than English)that is relevant to their proposed course of study (as indicated in requirement number one above). Thisrequirement must be met at the time of application or shortly thereafter. Proficiency is measured by thecompletion of a second-year sequence (or above) in the language or by demonstration of an equivalent skill.Language ability is essential to work in comparative literature of whatever sort. The Department of ComparativeLiterature works closely with the University of Chicago Language Center and will help students achieve theirindividual goals in language acquisition by suggesting programs of study that will add to their languageexpertise as appropriate.GradingAll courses to be used in the major must be taken for a quality grade of B– or higher, except for 1,which is graded on a Pass/Fail basis.HonorsTo be eligible for honors in Comparative Literature, students must earn an overall cumulative GPA of 3.25or higher, and a GPA of 3.5 or higher in the major. They must also complete a BA essay or project that is judgedexceptional in intellectual and/or creative merit by the first and second readers.AdvisingStudents must consult on an ongoing basis with the Director of Undergraduate Studies for selection andapproval of course work for the major. Students will need to regularly provide documentation of any approvalsfor the major to their College adviser for the necessary processing. Further advice and counseling will beavailable from the preceptor for the program and from the faculty member who supervises the student's BAproject.Comparative Literature Courses"

CMLT 2311,"2. Trans Performativity. 100 Units.In this course we will explore how these dialogues and conflicts between gender studies, queer theory, andtrans studies have developed and transformed our understandings of categories like "gender," "sex" and "trans."Some guiding questions will be: how do we, and should we, conceive the materiality of the body? How doassumptions about 'nature' and the 'natural' determine how we view categories of identity, and what are thepolitical ramifications of these determinations? Why, within certain discourses, has the fluidity of gender beenpromoted, while the fluidity of race remains controversial and generally unsupported? How do we accountfor these different receptions, and what kind of opportunities do they make available for politically engagedcommunities? How can we simultaneously value performative theories of gender, while also maintaining acertain stability of identity as developed within trans criticism, even when these two discourses seem in directconflict?Equivalent Course(s): "

CMLT 2321,"2. Art, Ekphrasis, and Myth in Early Modern Spanish Theater. 100 Units.In the early modern age, the verbal had a strong visual component. Poets and playwrights utilized the senseof sight since it was the highest of the Platonic senses and a mnemonic key to lead spectators to remembervividly what they had read or heard, long before spectacle plays were in fashion. One important techniquefor visualization was ekphrasis, the description of an art work within a text. Often, to perform was to imitatethe affects, sentiments and poses of a painting. For this purpose, playwrights such as Cervantes, Lope de Vegaand Calderón often turned to the mythological canvases of the Italian Renaissance along with the portraits ofgreat rulers and images of battle. The class will examine the uses of art onstage: mnemonic, mimetic, political,religious comic, tragic, lyric and licentious. It will also delve into different forms of ekphrasis from the notionalto the dramatic and from the fragmented to the reversed. Although the course will focus on Spanish plays of theearly modern period, it will also include ancient treatises by Cicero, and Pliny as well as Renaissance mnemonictreatises by Della Porta. The course will be in English. Reading knowledge of Spanish is required since plays willbe read in the original. Those taking the class for credit in Spanish must write their final paper in Spanish.Instructor(s): Frederick de Armas Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): 2, "

CMLT 2410,"5. Letters to Zion. 100 Units.This seminar centers the question: what do we mean when we describe Jewish authors and thinkers from thepast as Zionist, anti-Zionist, or non-Zionist? We will approach this question by reading three correspondences:Kafka's letters to Felice Bauer, and the correspondences between Gershom Scholem and Hannah Arendtand between Paul Celan and Ilana Shmueli. In each case, the question of Zionism and of Israel looms in thebackground of the exchange in some way. Our key question is: can we definitively determine the position of eachof these letter-writers on the question of Zionism? And do we want to? Or does the form of the correspondencerather open a possibility for a more flexible, complex account of their positions, allowing us to think of them aschanging and evolving, indeed as dialogic? In addition to the letters themselves, we will read other texts by theseauthors and about them, as well as background reading on the letter as genre and as historical document.

Focusing on genocide,slavery, conquest, confinement, immigration, and the diaspora of peoples around the globe, ComparativeRace and Ethnic Studies examines the material, artistic, and literary expressions of peoples who originated inAfrica, Latin America, Asia, and Europe, who moved voluntarily or were forcefully bound over to the Americasand here evolved stigmatized identities, which were tied to the cultures and histories of their natal lands incomplicated ways.A student who obtains a BA in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies will be well prepared for admissionto graduate programs in the humanities and social sciences, to professional schools in law, medicine, publichealth, social work, business, or international affairs, and to careers in education, journalism, politics, creativewriting, and the nonprofit sector. A degree in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies offers training designed toimpart fundamental skills in critical thinking, comparative analysis, social theory, research methods, and writtenexpression.Areas of specialization include: Africa Past and Present, African American Studies, Latino/a Studies, AsianAmerican Studies, and Native American Studies. This major/minor is also available to students interested in thestudy of Africa in a comparative framework.Program RequirementsStudents are encouraged to meet the general education requirement in the humanities and/or social sciencesbefore declaring their major. Students must meet with the student affairs administrator to discuss a plan of studyas soon as they declare their major (no later than the end of Spring Quarter of their third year).

Requirements for the Major and the MinorTHE MAJORStudents have two ways to fulfill the elective requirements for the major:Option 1 allows students to focus four courses on one specific area of specialization—Africa Past andPresent, African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latina/o Studies, or Native American Studies (otherdiasporic communities may qualify by petition)—and a second four-course cluster drawn from a different areaor four comparative courses. For example, one may choose to take four courses focused on African AmericanStudies and choose a second four courses focused exclusively on Asian American Studies or four courses in theComparative/General Studies category.Option 2 is designed for students who wish to explore comparative race and ethnic studies primarilythrough a disciplinary (e.g., anthropology, English, history) or interdisciplinary program focus (e.g., genderstudies, Latin American studies), or who wish to graduate with a double major in Comparative Race and EthnicStudies. Accordingly, one four-course cluster of electives must be focused on one area (Africa Past and Present,African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Latina/o Studies, Native American Studies). A second clusterof four courses should fall within a specific discipline or interdisciplinary area.The requirements for Options 1 and 2 are virtually identical: one or two civilization studies courses, eightelectives, a BA colloquium, and a BA essay. The BA program in CRES consists of eleven to twelve courses, ofwhich at least seven courses must be chosen from those listed or cross-listed as CRES courses. One upper-levellanguage course may be used to meet the major requirements. The course requires approval by the studentaffairs administrator.Summary of Requirements: Major in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies1–2 course(s) of a single civilization sequence *100-2004 courses in one specific area of specialization **4004 courses in a second area of specialization or 4 comparative courses ***4002018-2019 The College            2530BA Colloquium: Theory and Methods in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies1000BA Colloquium: Theory and Methods in Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies1000.

The goal of this pre-professionalprogram is not to have every student start a business, but rather for every student to have the opportunity to beexposed to an entrepreneurial way of thinking through experiential learning opportunities that complement thegeneral education curriculum.In addition to organizing College-specific workshops and opportunities, this Career Advancementprogram also works closely with the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation (http://research.chicagobooth.edu/polsky). College students are able to take advantage of world-class opportunities andresources available through the Polsky Center, including attending industry conferences, attending workshopsorganized by the MBA student–run Entrepreneurship and Venture Capital Club, and attending office hours withEntrepreneurs-in-Residence. Students are also able to take courses at Chicago Booth, notably an undergraduate-only section of Building the New Venture, an undergraduate-only section of Application Development, and theCollege New Venture Challenge course.Programming highlights for UChicago Careers in Entrepreneurship include:•The College New Venture Challenge is an undergraduate-only business plan competition that enablesstudents to go through the progression of discovering an idea, building a team, creating a proof of concept,and pitching to investors. Throughout the competition, students are engaged with mentors drawn fromalumni and local entrepreneurs.•Many student teams also enter competitions that are not sponsored by the University. Examples includecompetitions sponsored by Clinton Global Initiative, Clean Energy Trust, Net Impact, Microsoft, Google, andWal-Mart, as well as competitions sponsored by other universities like Stanford and MIT.•Social entrepreneurship is a popular topic on campus with many student organizations, includingGlobeMed, Campus Catalyst, and Envision Do, supporting students who want to solve social andenvironmental issues through new innovations.•Start-up careers and internships are another area of student interest. Many local companies participatein the Metcalf Internship program, and local start-up companies are encouraged to hire UChicago studentsthrough subsidies and other promotions. Of note, UChicago Careers in Entrepreneurship has strongpartnerships with the University's Polsky Exchange in Hyde Park, the 1871 incubator at the MerchandiseMart, and the health care incubator Matter.•In addition to bringing in alumni and local entrepreneurs as speakers, the program also engages withlocal angel investors and venture capital firms. Students have worked in associate roles while in school withsuch local groups as Chicago Ventures, OCA Ventures, and Hyde Park Angels.•Career treks are an outstanding way for students to meet with companies in various industries as wellas learn about different regions of the country or the world. In addition to treks to Silicon Valley, UChicagoCareers in Entrepreneurship looks to engage with other regional hubs of entrepreneurial opportunity,including New York City, Boston, Austin, and Chicago.Health ProfessionsUChicago Careers in Health Professions (https://careeradvancement.uchicago.edu/uchicago-careers-in/health-professions) (UCIHP) provides students with the resources and support to develop the knowledge, skills,competencies, and experiences required for advanced study in the health professions.

CRES 2750,"2. Africans in the Early Americas. 100 Units.During the era of the transatlantic slave trade, more than 350,000 Africans were forcibly trafficked to what is nowthe United States. The experiences of these men and women and their descendants-particularly their exploitationunder a system of racialized slavery-profoundly shaped the course of US history up to and including the presentday. These individuals were significant, but they were also only one part of the more than 12 million peoplewho came from Africa to the Americas in the colonial period. Focusing on the diverse experiences of Africansand their descendants-as slaves, but also as colonizers, soldiers, revolutionaries, family members, and free menand women-this course surveys the history of Africans in the Americas from the late fifteenth through the latenineteenth century. Adopting a broad geographic and temporal perspective allows for an exploration of theevolving relationships between labor, gender, and race in North, Central, and South America, including theSpanish, French, and English Caribbean. In this course we will ask: How did the experiences of Africans in thecolonial and early republican United States compare with those of Africans in other parts of early America? Howmight learning about and comparing the experiences of free and enslaved Africans and Afro-descended peoplesin different parts of the Americas re-shape our understanding of the multiple origins, meanings, and possibilitiesof race and national belonging?Instructor(s): T. Murphy Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): 4. Racism without Race. 100 Units.In early 2010 a member of staff at the Regenstein library contacted the police to report an unruly student. Thepolice arrived at the scene and charged the student with criminal trespass and resisting arrest. The studentwas put in a choke hold and handcuffed before being taken to the local police station where he was held in acell overnight.According to witnesses, the library staff member's response was unwarranted and so too werethe actions taken by the police officers. Individuals later interviewed for the Chicago Maroon described thestudent's treatment as an instance of 'racial profiling.' How are we to make sense of this incident and otherssimilar to it? There is strong evidence to suggest that the reactions of the authority figures involved wereshaped by their attitudes toward skin color. It would seem farfetched, however, to conclude that these reactionsreflected an ideology of racial differentiation or what we might call 'traditional' race ideology: the view thathuman beings can be classified scientifically according to race and that some races are better than, or superiorto, others. Theories of race and racial difference have largely been discredited and there are no longer anyofficial institutions, respected academics or public individuals who espouse these. How then do we explainthe continued salience of skin color, and what value is there in applying terms such as 'race' and 'racism' todescribe it? The following course seeks to reframe the way we go about analyzing contemporary forms of socialdifferentiation based on skin color. It looks at skin color as a culturally recognizable sign, which, like othersigns, acquires significance only within the context of a broader set of semiotic ideologies and practices. Thismeans directing our attention to the ways in which color-as-sign takes on meaning in the world we live. Suchan approach offers a conceptual framework for a comparative study of past and present forms of discriminationbased on skin color while also remaining sensitive to the particularities that define these.Instructor(s): Y.HilalEquivalent Course(s): 1. Urban Indians: Native Americans and the City. 100 Units.The majority of Native Americans in the United States now live in urban areas and this has been the case formore than half a century, but discussions about cities rarely acknowledge their presence beyond (sometimes)lumping them in with catchall categories often labeled "Other." In this course, students will encounter andexamine the distinct experiences and contributions of Native Americans in cities, large and small, past andpresent. We'll look, first, at the context in which the population shift away from rural and reservation spaces tookplace and discuss the ways in which being/becoming "urban" and the process of "urbanization" may not be asstraightforward as expected. Students will then dive into studies of the daily struggles and successes of NativeAmerican city-dwellers, with an emphasis on mid-20th-century Chicago. Readings and in-class activities willexplore issues related to: housing, work, stereotypes and discrimination, cultural survival and traditionalism,physical and mental health, the rise of pan-Indianism, activism, schooling, class divisions, multi/locality,generational differences, identity and intersectionality, representation and the arts, and the very recognition orlack thereof mentioned above. The knowledge and analytic skills developed in this course will therefore serveas an uncommon window into Native American studies and urban studies, as well as broader race- and place-conscious work in the social sciences and humanities.Instructor(s): A.

CRES 2425,"5. Everyday Maoism: Work, Daily Life, and Material Culture in Socialist China. 100 Units.The history of Maoist China is usually told as a sequence of political campaigns: land and marriage reform,nationalization of industry, anti-rightist campaign, Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, etc. Yet for themajority of the Chinese population, socialism was as much about material changes as about politics: about thetwo-story brick houses, electric lights and telephones (loushang louxia, diandeng dianhua) that the revolutionhad promised; about new work regimes and new consumption patterns-or, to the contrary, about the absenceof such change. If we want to understand what socialism meant for different groups of people, we have to lookat the "new objects" of socialist modernity, at changes in dress codes and apartment layouts, at electrificationand city planning. We have to analyze workplaces and labor processes in order to understand how socialismchanged the way people worked. We also have to look at the rationing of consumer goods and its effects onpeople's daily lives. The course has a strong comparative dimension: we will look at the literature on socialismin the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, to see how Chinese socialism differed from its cousins. Another aim ismethodological. How can we understand the lives of people who wrote little and were rarely written about? Towhich extent can we read people's life experiences out of material objects?Instructor(s): J. Eyferth Terms Offered: SpringEquivalent Course(s): "

The toolsof engineering are important in making and translating basic discoveries in other fields into new intellectualopportunities and, sometimes, useful technologies.Institute for Molecular EngineeringThe Institute for Molecular Engineering (IME) was founded on the principle of collaborative problem-solving, not rigid academic disciplines. It is at the forefront of an emerging field that has the potential to addressfundamental problems of societal import. This exciting new field involves the incorporation of syntheticmolecular building blocks into functional systems that will impact technologies from advanced medical therapiesto quantum computing.Created in partnership with Argonne National Laboratory, the IME builds on the tradition of collaborationand cutting-edge research well-established at Argonne and the University of Chicago. It conducts research at theintersection of chemical, electrical, mechanical, and biological engineering, as well as materials, biological, andphysical sciences. The institute’s exploration of innovative technologies in nanoscale manipulation and design ata molecular scale has the potential for impact in such areas as energy, health care, and the environment.Major Program in Molecular EngineeringThe BS degree program in Molecular Engineering offers undergraduates a cutting-edge engineeringcurriculum built on a strong foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Majors choose fromthree quantitative engineering tracks: one track aimed at engineering with a biology emphasis, a track with afocus on chemical and soft materials, and a track geared toward applied physics. The applied physics track,offered in close collaboration with the Department of Physics, is one of the first initiatives worldwide to formallyeducate quantum engineers at the undergraduate level.Courses in the major are designed to develop quantitative reasoning and problem-solving skills; tointroduce engineering analysis of physical, chemical, and biological systems; and to address open-endedtechnological questions across a spectrum of disciplines. The aim is to introduce invention and design, alongwith inquiry and discovery, as fruitful and complementary intellectual activities. The program will both prepareundergraduates for a wide variety of careers in technology-focused industries and position graduates for furtherpostgraduate study in such fields as science, engineering, medicine, business, or law.Major Program Requirements1. A strong and broad background in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. It is imperative fora modern engineer to have a strong and broad background in the sciences. Traditional engineering disciplineshave had requirements in math, chemistry, and physics for decades and many programs have evolved to requirebiology as well. The highly interdisciplinary nature of Molecular Engineering requires a foundation built acrossthe mathematical, physical, and biological sciences. Students are encouraged to complete their general educationrequirements as early in their academic sequence as possible and at the highest level for which they are prepared.This will better position students to take advantage of advanced electives and research opportunities.As discussed in more detail below, there are three tracks for Molecular Engineering majors: the BiologyTrack, the Chemical and Soft Materials Track, and the Quantum Track. Students in the first two tracks willfollow precedents set by Chemistry and Biological Sciences majors in that they will likely take chemistry in year1, physics in year 2, and follow the recommended mathematics courses in the Chemistry curriculum. Studentsin the Quantum Track will follow precedent set by Physics majors in that they will likely take physics in year 1,follow the mathematics guidelines of Physics majors, and take chemistry in year 2.2. 0 Language, History, and Culture III, andis aimed at developing a broad knowledge of the field through the close study of major works and the criticaltechniques appropriate to their interpretation.

Topics in US-Mexico Borderlands History. 100 Units.This course explores the history of the U.S.-Mexican borderlands, from its native past to its present, as ageographical place and as a site of contested sovereignties. It is organized around major themes in the history ofthe region, including indigenous and European imperialism, settler colonialism, nationalism, migration, labor,and citizenship. Special attention will also be given to the themes of cultural hybridity, transculturation, andthe fluidity of social identities defined by the categories of class, ethnicity, gender, nationality, and race. Thestructure of this course emphasizes the interaction of historical forces across imperial, national, and culturalboundaries, highlighting the dynamism of borderlands as historical phenomena and as a method of interpretingand understanding the past. Students enrolled in this course will gain critical thinking and analytical skills aswell as a broader understanding of topics in U.S. and Mexican history that continue to influence contemporarypolitical debates. They will be encouraged to look beyond the rigid dichotomies that often divide the borderlandsand investigate the full spectrum of cultural, economic, and social relationships that bring people together as wellas those that push them apart. Students will also learn to look for common patterns that emerge across time andspace while remaining attentive to the nuances of local identities, cultures, and histories.Instructor(s): D. Webb Terms Offered: Autumn2. Gender, Sexuality, Indigenous Women in the Colonial Encounter. 100 Units.This course is premised on the belief that the history of gender and sexuality in colonial contexts is just ascrucial and revealing as other more geopolitical, military, or diplomatic topics. In this sense, laws regulatingmarriage or Europeans exchanging of postcards of "exotic women" are just as significant as land annexations ormilitary technology. Through the quarter, we will think through not only what the history of imperialism tellsus about gender and sexuality, but also what this type of analysis reveals about colonialism and empire. Whatwas the relationship between the socio- political organization of European empires and ideologies of gender andsexuality in both colony and metropole? We will also consider intersectional questions, such as the connectionsbetween regulating intimacy and the creation of race-based imperial hierarchies. To gain historical precisionin examining these more abstract or theoretical questions, we will anchor our readings and discussion aroundparticular indigenous woman and their contexts. While the study of gender and sexuality in a colonial contexthas come a long way in recent years, the majority of sources for examining gender and colonialism are aboutwhite women. To push back against this absence, we will take a case study approach to consider the lives andnarratives surrounding indigenous women in colonial cultures.Instructor(s): E.

CRES 2020,"7. Race, Ethnicity, and Human Development. 100 Units.Twenty-first century practices of relevance to education, social services, health care and public policy deservebuttressing by cultural and context linked perspectives about human development as experienced by diversegroups. Although generally unacknowledged as such post-Brown v. 1954, the conditions purported to supporthuman development for diverse citizens remain problematic. The consequent interpretative shortcomings serveto increase human vulnerability. Specifically, given the problem of evident unacknowledged privilege for someas well as the insufficient access to resources experienced by others, the dilemma skews our interpretation ofbehavior, design of research, choice of theory, and determination of policy and practice. The course is based uponthe premise that the study of human development is enhanced by examining the experiences of diverse groups,without one group standing as the "standard" against which others are compared and evaluated. Accordingly,the course provides an encompassing theoretical framework for examining the processes of human developmentfor diverse humans while also highlighting the critical role of context and culture.Instructor(s): M.

CMSC 2331,"0Advanced Distributed Systems0. Advanced Distributed Systems. 100 Units.In recent years, large distributed systems have taken a prominent role not just in scientific inquiry, but also inour daily lives. When we perform a search on Google, stream content from Netflix, place an order on Amazon,or catch up on the latest comings-and-goings on Facebook, our seemingly minute requests are processedby complex systems that sometimes include hundreds of thousands of computers, connected by both localand wide area networks. Recent papers in the field of Distributed Systems have described several solutions(such as MapReduce, BigTable, Dynamo, Cassandra, etc.) for managing large-scale data and computation.However, building and using these systems pose a number of more fundamental challenges: How do we keepthe system operating correctly even when individual machines fail? How do we ensure that all the machineshave a consistent view of the system's state? (And how do we ensure this in the presence of failures?) Howcan we determine the order of events in a system where we can't assume a single global clock? Many of thesefundamental problems were identified and solved over the course of several decades, starting in the 1970s. Tobetter appreciate the challenges of recent developments in the field of Distributed Systems, this course will guidestudents through seminal work in Distributed Systems from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, leading up to a discussionof recent work in the field.Instructor(s): B.

In our courses, students work with established poets and prose writers towards these pursuits,and both the major and minor in Creative Writing provide ample opportunities for interdisciplinary work acrossUniversity departments. The program’s commitment to interdisciplinary work and academic rigor, coupled withan emphasis on teaching the elements of creative writing that underlie all genres, accounts for the program'svitality and explains why Creative Writing at Chicago is currently the largest initiative in the humanities for theCollege.The Program in Creative Writing offers workshops and seminars in poetry, fiction, and nonfiction,as well as an increasing number of translation workshops. The major seminars—including the TechnicalSeminars and Fundamentals in Creative Writing—are designed to build a critical and aesthetic foundation forstudents working in each primary genre. Students can pursue their creative writing interests within the formalrequirements of the major in Creative Writing or through a joint minor in English and Creative Writing, whichis open to students outside those two major programs. Students who do not wish to pursue a formal programin Creative Writing will have access to courses that satisfy the general education requirement in the arts andopen-entry "beginning" workshops. They may also apply for advanced workshop courses. Our workshops andtechnical seminars are cross-listed with a graduate number and open to students in the graduate and professionalschools.Major in Creative WritingStudents who graduate with the bachelor of arts in Creative Writing will both be skilled in writing in a majorliterary genre and have a theoretically informed understanding of the aesthetic, historical, social, and politicalcontext of a range of contemporary writing. Students in the major will focus their studies on a primary genrechosen from fiction, poetry, and nonfiction.The organization of the major recognizes the value of workshop courses, but incorporates that model into abroader education that furthers students’ knowledge of historical and contemporary literary practice, introducesthem to aesthetic and literary theory, sharpens their critical attention, and fosters their creative enthusiasm.Valuable experience with group work and peer criticism, which comes from the practices and skills central toCreative Writing pedagogy, will prepare students for success in a range of fields in the public and private sectors.Program RequirementsThe Program in Creative Writing requires a total of 13 courses and completion of a BA thesis, as describedbelow. Students who matriculated in 2016–17 or later may declare this major. Students planning to complete themajor must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and file a worksheet with the program by the endof the Autumn Quarter of the third year of study.All interested students should speak with the Director of Undergraduate Studies or the Program Manager.Students contemplating a major or minor in Creative Writing may choose to take one or two CreativeWriting courses toward the general education requirement in the arts.

Sebald, Teju Cole, Rachel Cusk, and Shelia Heti and alsoconsider writers like Kathryn Harrison, Tobias Wolff, and Gregor von Rezzori, who have addressed the samesubjects in both fiction and nonfiction. Finally, we'll dip into Robert Musil's notion of "essayism" as a modernmode of thought and the recent debate over the "lyric essay." We'll also look at journalistic and/or documentaryworks by Werner Herzog, Truman Capote, Tom Bissell, Katherine Boo, and Ryszard Kapuściński. By exploringthe interestingly smudged line between factual and fictional texts, we'll interrogate both genre categories andways of perceiving and presenting what's true.Instructor(s): Will Boast Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): Students apply for consent by filling out the CW Seminar Consent Form oncreativewriting.uchicago.edu.

Technical Seminar in Poetry: Units of Composition. 100 Units.This course aims to investigate, through a range of readings and writing exercises, various units of compositionand the ways that they interact with each other in poems. We will study and imitate traditional formalapproaches, such as the poetic foot, meter, caesuras, sprung rhythm, rhymed stanzas, and refrains. We alsowill study and imitate modernist and contemporary "units," such as the word (approached, for example,etymologically or connotatively), the free verse line, the variable foot, vers libre, serial form, the sentence (the"new" sentence, but also modulations of basic syntax), the paragraph, the page, and forms of call and response.This reading intensive course will draw from a selection of mostly modern and contemporary poetry, poetics,and criticism. Students will be expected to submit weekly technical exercises, complete several short criticalresponses, write a longer essay, and submit a final portfolio of revised material.Equivalent Course(s): "

Technical Seminar in Nonfiction: The Synecdoche. 100 Units.Every writer of personal nonfiction knows that ultimately the story isn't about them: it's about somethinglarger, perhaps universal, and their personal story is merely a means to that end. The key to this paradox is thesynecdoche, or the part that stands for the whole. It's the grain of sand that contains the universe, the one storythat by implication tells other peoples' stories. When Anne Fadiman told the story of a Hmong immigrant to theUnited States, she told a larger story about immigration in general. So did Joan Didion, in Where I Was From; bytelling the story of her family, she told the story of California, and by telling the story of California she told thestory of the West and thus of America. Rian Malan did the same in My Traitor's Heart: by telling the story of hisfamily he told the story of Apartheid, and thus of South Africa, and of our segregated world. Through weeklyexercises and analytic essays you'll see how these and other writers locate the universal in their particulars, andyou'll apply their examples to your own work.Instructor(s): Dan Raeburn Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): Instructor consent required.

Ordinarily,two of these courses will be Research Background Electives. Substitutions for a further course will be subject toapproval, but students may not substitute non-literature courses for the Literature Course requirement.For students double majoring, this means a maximum of three courses can count towards both majors(pending approval from both departments).Double Majors in English Language and Literature and Creative WritingWhen students choose a double major in Creative Writing and English Language and Literature, they maycount up to four courses towards both majors. These four courses will typically include the three LiteratureCourses and the Literary Genre course, but in some cases one of the slots might be filled by a CRWR course (withDirector of Undergraduate Studies approval). However, the two Research Background Electives required for theCreative Writing major should be taken outside of the Department of English Language and Literature.This means that a maximum of four English Language and Literature courses, including the Literary Genrecourse, can count towards the Creative Writing major.Students who are pursuing only the English Language and Literature major may count up to four CRWRcourses towards the major in English as electives without a petition. However, when students are pursuing a286         Creative Writingdouble major in English Language and Literature and Creative Writing, they must observe the shared four-course maximum, so any eligible CRWR courses beyond this cap must be counted towards English only.GradingStudents with a major in Creative Writing must receive quality grades (not P/F) in all courses countingtoward the major or minor.

In this workshop you'll write two drafts of your own essai, orattempt, at the form, while line editing and critiquing your classmates' attempts. You'll also do close readings,starting with "Why I Write," by George Orwell, and "Why I Write," by Joan Didion. Then James Baldwin's"Autobiographical Notes." Once we've had a taste of the present we'll go back four thousand years to the essay'sbeginnings in Babylon, following its evolution in Greece and Rome-Heraclitus, Plutarch, Seneca-then Europe:Montaigne, Max Beerbohm, Walter Benjamin, and Natalia Ginzburg, returning to contemporary English-language writers, including Adrienne Rich and Margaret Atwood, ending with Didion's "Goodbye to All That,"paired with Eula Biss's contemporary cover version, also titled "Goodbye to All That."Instructor(s): Dan Raeburn; Staff Terms Offered: Autumn,Spring,WinterPrerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

Reading as a Writer: Hallucinations. 100 Units.In this course we ask: How is historical material made--figured/disfigured by loss, desire, violence, suffering,exhaustion, death; by restlessness and the unbearable, abyssal, vertigo of living inside time? Where is theaperture of experience? The apparitions, which partition night, its many voices, bodies which are forgotten,and then remembered, why? What is the time of writing, of reading? This course goes a little back and a littleforward between the two world wars, hoping to track an itinerary of history material, its incandescence, betweensituations of mourning and mystical experience. Students will be asked to keep a reading notebook as well as toproduce weekly creative responses for class discussion.Instructor(s): Lynn Xu Terms Offered: WinterPrerequisite(s): Open bid through my.uchicago.edu.

Reading as a Writer: The Sea. 100 Units.What is the temporality of the sea? Its consciousness? Where does it begin? Or end? In this course, we willconsider the sea both as a figure in our literary, critical, visual, political, historical, and ecological imaginations,as well as a body in itself, iridescent and gleaming at the end of the world. We will look at practices of burial atsea, the infamous "wine dark sea" of Homer, the Middle Passage, the hold and wake of the ship, necropolitics,the concept of sovereignty and bare life, stowaway and asylum seekers, piracy and floating armories, eco-materialism, the post-human and alien worlds of our oceanic origins, the moon . . . and so on. Students will beasked to keep a reading notebook as well as to produce weekly creative responses for class discussion.

These are all labels that criticsand reviewers have used to characterize prose styles that call attention to themselves in distinct ways. Ofcourse, what constitutes style not only changes over time, but also means different things in different literarytraditions. How, then, do translators carry style over from one language and cultural milieu to another? And towhat extent does style structure storytelling? We will explore these questions by reading a variety of modernand contemporary stylists who either write in English or translate into English, paying special attention towhat stylistic devices are at work and what their implications are for narration, characterization, and worldbuilding. Further, we'll examine the range of choices that each writer and translator makes when constitutingand reconstituting style, on a lexical, tonal, and syntactic scale. By pairing readings with generative exercises instylistics and constrained writing, we will build toward the translation of a short work of contemporary fictioninto English. To participate in this workshop, students should be able to comfortably read a literary text in aforeign language.Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): Instructor consent required.

In this advanced workshop course, we'll discuss the genre of young adultliterature through evaluation of your own writing: what are its defining characteristics, and what's the differencebetween writing for a young adult audience versus writing books and stories about teenagers but designed foradult readers? Students should be working on book-length projects involving teenaged protagonists, no matterthe intended audience; please come to the first session with either work to submit or a sense of when you'd beable to sign up for a slot. We'll spend most of our time evaluating student work, learning how to become bothgenerous and rigorous critics, and we'll also talk about the books that influenced us the most as young adultreaders and the books we're reading today, from contemporary writers like John Green and Rainbow Rowell toclassic authors like S.

Topics in EALC: Intertwined Literatures of Postwar Asia. 100 Units.This course explores literature that illustrates the interconnectedness of Asia in the decade following theconclusion of the Second World War. While the surrender of Japan and the onset of the Cold War contributed tothe re-entrenchment of fiercely independent national literatures in Asia, national frameworks tend to obscure theongoing links across Asia evoked in the works of many writers dealing with this period. Further, the notion ofthe "postwar" tends to disregard the ways in which war's effects continued to shape the Asian continent throughAllied occupations and such widespread conflicts as the Chinese Civil War and the Korean War. By puttingthe postwar literatures of Asia in conversation with one another, we will aim to achieve a fuller understandingof these texts that have both depicted international circulation and spread through international communitiesthemselves. Course materials include short stories, novels, plays, reportage, and autobiographical writings fromJapan, China, Hong Kong, Tibet, Mongolia, Okinawa, and North and South Korea.

Revolutionary Romance in Socialist China. 100 Units.One of the goals of the socialist revolution was to transform social relations, not only those between classesbut also family and romantic relations. One of the first laws that the Chinese Communist Party issued after thefounding of the People's Republic was the New Marriage Law, which banned arranged marriages, concubinage,and arrangements involving minors. 1950s cinema and literature advertised romantic love as an importantachievement of the new society. At the same time, loyalty to the Party and to the collectivity were also core valuesthat the media emphasized. In this class, we will look at how literature and cinema instructed viewers on howto select one's object of love in Revolutionary China, and how love for a romantic partner, for the party, and forthe people were differently foregrounded at specific historical moments. How did ideas of romantic love changefrom the 1940s to the 1980s, and how did cinema contribute to promoting them? What forms of intimacy andmodels of attachment characterized revolutionary romance? Which kind of person constituted an ideal romanticpartner? Who was to be loved, how, and why? Should one orient one's passion toward one person, many, ornone?Instructor(s): P.

EALC 2245,"1. Social and Economic Institutions of Chinese Socialism, 1949 to 1980. 100 Units.The socialist period (for our purposes here, c. 1949-1990) fundamentally transformed the institutions of Chinesesocial and economic life. Marriage and family were redefined; rural communities were reorganized on acollective basis; private property in land and other means of production was abolished. Industrialization createda new urban working class, whose access to welfare, consumer goods, and political rights depended to a largeextent on their membership in work units (danwei). Migration between city and countryside came to a halt, andrural and urban society developed in different directions. This course will focus on the concrete details of howthis society functioned. How did state planning work? What was it like to work in a socialist factory? What roledid money and consumption play in a planned economy? Our readings are in English, but speakers of Chineseare encouraged to use Chinese materials (first-hand sources, if they can be found) for their final papers.Instructor(s): J.

Censorship in East Asia: The Case of Colonial Korea. 100 Units.This course examines the operation and consequences of censorship in the Japanese Empire, with focus onits effects in colonial Korea. It begins with two basic premises: first, both the Japanese colonial authorities'measures of repression, and the Korean responses to them, can be understood as noticeably more staunch andsophisticated when compared to any other region of the Empire; and second, the censorship practices in Koreaoffers itself as a case that is in itself an effective point of comparison to better understand other censorshipoperations in general and the impact of these operations across different regions. With a view to probing aninter- and intra-relationship between censorship practices among a variety of imperial/colonial regions, thiscourse studies the institutions related to censorship, the human agents involved in censorship-both external andinternal-and texts and translations that were produced in and outside of Korea, and were subject to censorship.Overall, the course stresses the importance of establishing a comparative understanding of the functions ofcensorship, and on the basis of this comparative thinking we will strive to conceptualize the characteristics ofJapanese colonial censorship in Korea.Instructor(s): K.

China's Eco-Environmental Challenges and Society's Responses. 100 Units.In nearly four decades of reform and opening policies, China's economic achievements have come at a high costfor its ecological environment; air pollution, water pollution, and soil contamination, among other problems, arefacts of life for most Chinese citizens. In addition, China is now the world's biggest emitter of carbon dioxide andhas recently acknowledged its contributions to global warming and the need for drastic mitigation of greenhousegases. Facing these tremendous challenges, remarkable shifts in the way that Chinese society communicatesand tackles these problems are occurring. This seminar will look, in particular, at relevant public debates,crucial policies, as well as popular initiatives and protest, to approach this wide topic. How is the relationshipbetween humans/society and nature/environment conceptualized and communicated? Can we detect shiftsfrom traditional to modern, even contemporary 'Chinese approaches'? And to what extent and how do politicalauthorities, media, the general population and scientists in China interact in the face of the acknowledgedrisks that environmental pollution poses to communities, to China's (economic) development and, not least, toindividual health and well-being.

In this class we will discuss concepts of citizenship and analyze their representations inmodern Chinese society. This includes historical and conceptual-history dimensions and encompasses notionsof citizenship that are pertaining to the local, national (incl. empire/civilization), and the global level. Overthe course of the semester we will touch upon topics such as forms of inclusion into (and exclusion from) theemerging Chinese 'welfare' model ("social citizenship"), political representation and participation ("politicalcitizenship"), law and rights ("legal citizenship"), domestic and international (im)migration, nationalism, andmany more.

The novel not only displays the unprecedented usage of realisticlanguage in portraying the quotidian life, but also shows intricate literary skills in narrative and lyricism. Thisclass investigates the internal and external worlds of Honglou meng, and reflects on the ethics and aesthetics ofnovel in late imperial China. We will explore, on the one hand, literary choices that made the novel sophisticated,such as the narrative strategies, the complexity in characterization, and the high degree of intertextuality whichshows the creative use of other literary genres (poetry, drama, riddle). On the other hand, reading alongsiderecent scholarship on material culture and gender studies, we examine the interactive relations between the noveland the fashion of exquisite domestic life in the late imperial society and answer these questions.

Uponcompletion of the paper in the Spring Quarter, the student will then be retroactively registered for the course inthe fourth-year quarter of the student's choosing. Plan for this retroactive registration with your College adviser.The research paper, a transcript, and a recommendation letter from the faculty sponsor evaluating theindependent research paper must be submitted to the undergraduate economics program office for considerationby the economics honors committee no later than the end of fourth week of the quarter in which the studentplans to graduate. Students wishing to qualify for honors should (1) engage in preparatory course work in thearea of interest no later than Spring Quarter of their third year and (2) consult with the program advisers no laterthan Winter Quarter of their third year.This program may accept a BA paper or project used to satisfy the same requirement in another major ifcertain conditions are met and with the consent of the other program chair. Approval from both program chairsis required. Students should consult with the chairs by the earliest BA proposal deadline (or by the end of thirdyear, when neither program publishes a deadline). A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available fromthe College adviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter ofthe student's year of graduation.Preparation for PhD Programs in EconomicsStudents preparing to pursue a PhD program in economics should complete advanced course workin mathematics, statistics, and computer science.

Courses address fundamental questions abouttopics such as the status of literature within culture, the literary history of a period, the achievements of a majorauthor, the defining characteristics of a genre, the politics of interpretation, the formal beauties of individualworks, and the methods of literary scholarship and research.The study of English may be pursued as preparation for graduate work in literature or other disciplines,or as a complement to general education. Students in the Department of English Language and Literature learnhow to ask probing questions of a large body of material; how to formulate, analyze, and judge questions andtheir answers; and how to present both questions and answers in clear, cogent prose. To the end of cultivatingand testing these skills, which are central to virtually any career, each course offered by the English Departmentstresses writing.Although the main focus of the English Department is to develop reading, writing, and research skills, thevalue of bringing a range of disciplinary perspectives to bear on the works studied is also recognized. Besidesoffering a wide variety of courses in English, the English Department encourages students to integrate theintellectual concerns of other fields into their study of literature. This is done by permitting up to three coursesoutside the English Department to be counted as part of the major if a student can demonstrate the relevanceof these courses to his or her program of study. Those interested in creative writing should see Creative Writingbelow.Program RequirementsThe Department of English requires a total of 13 courses: 11 courses taken within the Department of Englishand two language courses beyond the College requirement or their equivalent, as well as a Cluster Statement tobe submitted by the end of the third week of Spring Quarter of a student’s third year. The program presupposesthe completion of the general education requirement in the humanities (or its equivalent), in which basic trainingis provided in the methods, problems, and disciplines of humanistic study.Language RequirementBecause literary study is enriched by some knowledge of other cultural expressions, the major in Englishrequires students to extend their knowledge of a language beyond the level required of all College students. Allstudents must complete two quarters of study at the second-year level in a language other than English (or theequivalent as determined by petition).NOTE: If a student has placed into a language's 20200-level course, they should take the course they havetested into. Upon completion, they can go through the Language Center (https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/attachments/language_petition.pdf) petition process to receive back credit for theskipped intermediate-level course (20100). Students who place into a language course beyond 20200 (that is,the third course of the intermediate level, or above) and would like to discuss the possibility of petitioning for asubstitute to the language requirement, should provide the Student Affairs Assistant with an official copy of theirplacement results and set up an appointment.Alternatively, students may take two courses in an advanced computer language. As of Autumn 2013, thefollowing course combinations may be taken to satisfy the language requirement:"

ECON 1900,"0. Economics for Everyone. 100 Units.The field of economics has generated a powerful set of insights which have fundamentally shaped the modernworld. Because modern economics puts such a heavy stress on mathematical rigor, the most interesting economicideas often get pushed to the background. In this course, we will explore these big economic ideas, without themath. Our goal is to make the beauty and power of economic thinking available to everyone. We will discusswhat it means to think like an economist, how you can use economic thinking to make the world a better place(or to take advantage of your friends and enemies, if you prefer), and also how sometimes thinking like aneconomist can get you into trouble.Terms Offered: Winter"
ECON 1910,"0. Economics for Everyone: Macro. 100 Units.This course explores the big ideas in macroeconomics in a way that is enjoyable and accessible, with minimalreliance on mathematics. The goal is to provide an introduction to macroeconomic issues for people who havenever before studied macroeconomics (and who might never study it again), so that they can understandand contribute to ongoing discussions in the news and on social media. We will demystify some of the majormacroeconomic questions of our times: Why is there unemployment? Why are some countries poor? What's thebig deal about government debt? How high should we set taxes? What gives money and stocks their value? Whatdoes the Fed do? And why did all those economists win Nobel Prizes?

Inequality and the Social Safety Net: Theory, Empirics, and Policies. 100 Units.This course will introduce students to key economic and conceptual issues surrounding inequality and the socialsafety net. We will study the theoretical underpinnings and empirical analysis of the social safety net, focusingon the effects of social insurance and public assistance programs on individual and societal outcomes. Afterstudying models of the insurance-incentive tradeoff, we will apply these models and econometric strategiesto the empirical analysis of social safety net programs. We will study how social safety net programs interactwith labor markets, specifically human capital investment and work decisions, and how they affect long-termoutcomes such as income, health, well-being, and inequality. Students will learn how to analyze the tradeoffsinvolved in social safety net programs and will learn the current state of evidence on these programs.Instructor(s): M.

Health Impacts of Transportation Systems. 100 Units.Transportation systems affect human health through complex pathways. Governments invest in transportinfrastructure because it encourages economic growth and mobility of people and goods, which have directand indirect benefits to health. Yet, an excessive reliance on motorized modes of transport harms populationhealth, the environment and social wellbeing. The impact on population health is substantial: Globally, roadtraffic crashes kill over 1.3 million annually. Air pollution, to which transport is an important contributor,kills another 3.2 million people. Motorized modes of transport are also an important contributor to sedentarylifestyles. Physical inactivity is estimated to cause 3.2 million deaths every year, globally. This course willintroduce students to thinking about transportation as a technological system that affects human health andwellbeing through intended and unintended mechanisms. The course will examine the complex relationshipbetween transportation, land use, urban form, and geography, and explore how decisions in other sectors affecttransportation systems, and how these in turn affect human health. Students will learn to recognize how thesystem level properties of a range of transportation systems (such as limited-access highways, urban mass transit,inter-city rail) affect human health. The course reviews the pathways through which road transport impactspopulation health and focuses on how to measure these impacts, and how to compare them with other leadingcauses of health loss.Instructor(s): Kavi Bhalla Terms Offered: 0"

Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality.

By Winter Quarter of their third year, students must alsomeet with the Student Affairs Assistant to review their English Requirements Worksheet.Two quarters of study at the second-year level in a language other than English200or credit for the equivalent as determined by petitionor two quarters of a computer languageA total of 11 additional English courses is required to meet the distribution requirements of the major (onecourse may satisfy more than one requirement):1100One English introduction to a genre course or "Approaches to Theater" courseOne English course in fictionOne English course in poetryOne English course in dramaOne English course in literature written before 1650One English course in literature written between 1650 and 1830One English course in literature written between 1830 and 1940One English course in literary or critical theoryOne to seven English electives (may include 0)Cluster Statement with five courses *344         English Language and LiteratureBA Project (optional)000Total Units1300*The Cluster Statement must be submitted by the end of the third week of Spring Quarter of a student’sthird year. This requirement is worth 000 units. See the section "Cluster Statement" above for details.Courses Outside the Department Taken for Program CreditA maximum of three courses outside the Department of English may count toward the total numberof courses required by the major. Two of these may count toward the student’s "cluster." The student, afterdiscussion with the Student Affairs Assistant, may submit a petition for course approval to the Director ofUndergraduate Studies before taking courses outside the English Department for credit toward the major.Such courses may be selected from related areas in the University (history, philosophy, religious studies, socialsciences, etc.) or they may be taken from a study abroad program.Four total Creative Writing (CRWR) courses may be counted toward the elective requirement without apetition.Transfer credits for courses taken at another institution are subject to approval by the Director ofUndergraduate Studies and are limited to a maximum of three courses. Transferred courses do not contributeto the student's University of Chicago grade point average for the purpose of computing an overall GPA, dean'slist, or honors. NOTE: The Office of the Dean of Students in the College must approve the transfer of all coursestaken at other institutions, with the exception of courses taken as part of a University-sponsored study abroadprogram. For details, visit the Transfer Credit page.Creative WritingUndergraduate students may also declare a major in Creative Writing. Students who are not majoring inEnglish Language and Literature or Creative Writing may declare the minor in English and Creative Writing.Students interested in pursuing these options should contact the Program Coordinator for Creative Writingfor further information. Please note that there is no minor solely in English. The minor in English and CreativeWriting for non–English majors is the only minor available through the Department of English Language andLiterature.Double Majors in English Language and Literature and Creative WritingWhen students choose a double major in Creative Writing and English Language and Literature, they maycount up to four courses towards both majors. These four courses will typically include the three LiteratureCourses and the Literary Genre course, but in some cases one of these slots might be filled by a CRWR course(with Director of Undergraduate Studies approval). However, the two Research Background Electives requiredfor the Creative Writing major should be taken outside of the Department of English Language and Literature.This means that a maximum of four English Language and Literature courses, including the Literary Genrecourse, can count towards the Creative Writing major.Students who are pursuing only the English Language and Literature major may count up to four CRWRcourses towards the major in English as electives without a petition. However, when students are pursuing adouble major in English Language and Literature and Creative Writing, they must observe the shared four-course maximum, so any eligible CRWR courses beyond this cap must be counted towards English only.Minor in English and Creative WritingStudents who are not English Language and Literature or Creative Writing majors may complete a minor inEnglish and Creative Writing. Such a minor requires six courses plus a portfolio of creative work. At least two ofthe required courses must be Creative Writing (CRWR) workshop courses, with at least one being an AdvancedWorkshop. Three of the remaining required courses may be taken in either the Department of English Languageand Literature (ENGL) or the Program in Creative Writing (CRWR). This may include CRWR Technical Seminarsor general education courses, as long as they are not already counted toward the general education requirementin the arts.In addition, students must enroll in one of the following workshops offered during the Winter Quarter:0Independent BA Paper Preparation100Enrollment in 0 Independent BA Paper Preparation requiresapproval from the Director of Undergraduate Studies. They may be eligible to fulfill requirements for the majorif they are taken for a quality grade (not P/F) and include a final paper assignment. No student may use morethan two readings courses in the major. Critical BA writers who wish to register for 0 Independent BAPaper Preparation must arrange for appropriate faculty supervision and obtain the permission of the Director ofUndergraduate Studies. 0 Independent BA Paper Preparation counts as an English elective but not asone of the courses fulfilling distribution requirements for the major.NOTE: Reading courses are special research opportunities that must be justified by the quality of theproposed plan of study; they also depend upon the availability of faculty supervision. No student can expect areading course to be arranged automatically.GradingStudents majoring in English must receive quality grades (not P/F) in all 13 courses taken to meet therequirements of the program. Non-majors may take English courses for P/F grading with consent of instructor.346         English Language and LiteratureAdvisingStudents are encouraged to declare a major in English as early as possible, ideally before the end oftheir second year. Students who declare the major after their second year must notify the Student AffairsAssistant to ensure that departmental advising assignments are arranged. After declaring the major, studentsshould arrange a meeting with the Student Affairs Assistant, who will help students fill out the EnglishRequirements Worksheet. Students should also subscribe to the departmental email list for majors (ugrad-english@lists.uchicago.edu) (ugrad-english@lists.uchicago.edu) to ensure that they do not miss importantcommunications from the undergraduate office.Third-year students will be assigned a departmental faculty advisor. Students should meet with their facultyadvisor at least twice a year to discuss their academic interests, progress in the major, and long-term careergoals. The Student Affairs Assistant and Director of Undergraduate Studies are also available to assist students.Students should meet with the Student Affairs Assistant early in their final quarter to be sure they have fulfilledall requirements.The London ProgramThis program, offered in Autumn Quarter, provides students with an opportunity to study British literatureand history in the cultural and political capital of England in the Autumn Quarter. In the ten-week program,students take four courses, three of which are each compressed into approximately three weeks and taughtin succession by Chicago faculty. The fourth, project-oriented, course is conducted at a less intensive pace.The program includes a number of field trips (e.g., Cornwall, Bath, Canterbury, Cambridge). The Londonprogram is designed for third- and fourth-year students with a strong interest and some course work in Britishliterature and history. Applications are available on the University of Chicago's Study Abroad home page (study-abroad.uchicago.edu) and typically are due in mid–Winter Quarter.English Language and Literature Courses"
ENGL 2970,"0Reading Course1000 Reading Course or 5. Incarcerated Life. 100 Units.The United States today is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, one in which millions of Americans arecurrently warehoused within, or have passed through, carceral institutions. Many scholars locate the emergenceof this punitive turn in the 1970s, and with good reason: the landscape of penality and confinement looksmuch different in earlier historical periods. Turning to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, this course willexplore literary, philosophical, and pragmatic engagements with the prison across the British Empire and inthe postcolonial United States. By tracing the particular fears and fantasies that grouped around institutionsof confinement, we will explore the logic by which an institution once marginal to social life has become socentral to society that incarceration is now a conventional form of life. This course will involve a robust researchcomponent, culminating in a final paper; while this course is rooted in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,students will be welcome to pursue research on contemporary regimes of incarceration. Our theoretical readingswill include Michel Foucault, Angela Davis, and Ruth Wilson Gilmore. Our archive of literary, philosophical, andpractical texts will include the Newgate Calendar, Cesare Beccaria, Oliver Goldsmith, John Gay, Jeremy Bentham,James Williams, Harriet Jacobs, and Austin Reed.

I have chosentexts that highlight the period's central preoccupations: gender and sexuality. A time during which the so-calledWoman Question vexed politicians, commentators and activists, when marriage and motherhood were underreview, and styles of masculinity contested, literature of the period presented dynamic discussions about theroles of men and women, how they might interact, and what they can do. These texts are also some of the mostformally innovative of the period. Texts are likely to include Robert Browning's Men and Women (which gives usour title), Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Aurora Leigh, M E Braddon, Lady Audley's Secret, Lewis Carroll, Alice inWonderland, and short stories by the New Woman writer, George Egerton, and Oscar Wilde.

ENGL 1272,"0. Inventing Consciousness: Literature, Philosophy, Psychology. 100 Units.Consciousness is an historical achievement. As a phenomenon, consciousness probably came into beingsomewhere deep in evolutionary time. Yet as a concept consciousness is relatively new: the European notionof consciousness emerges only in the late seventeenth century. This course draws on the resources of literature,history, philosophy, and psychology to examine how the concept of consciousness came to possess theexplanatory dominance it currently holds. We will begin by acquiring a sense of what consciousness currentlymeans in philosophy and psychology, paying particular attention to how the Western concept differs fromsimilar ideas in such traditions as Buddhism. After examining the pre-history of consciousness by readingsuch authors as William Shakespeare, we will then turn to two historical moments that were central to theconcept's development. First, we will train our attention on the interplay between philosophy and literature inthe late seventeenth century, reading texts by René Descartes, John Milton, Thomas Traherne, and John Locke.Second, we will focus on how, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the psychology of WilliamJames contributed to the development of "stream of consciousness" techniques in the novels of Henry Jamesand Virginia Woolf. In this course, we will stress the historical contingency of this concept-consciousness hasa birthdate-in order to determine the nature of a consequence that follows from this fact: the extent to whichcurrent uses of this concept are still shaped and constrained by the historical circumstances that conditioned itsappearance and development.

ENGL 1372,"0. Thinking with Race in Medieval England. 100 Units.The medieval period is often thought of as the era just before the idea of race emerged - before the Atlanticslave trade, before European colonialism, before scientific racism. At the same time, the Middle Ages have beencrucial to modern phenomena of racialized nationalism and ideologies of whiteness. In recent years, medievalistshave studied and debated race's significance. Acknowledging the complex and urgent status of medieval racetoday, this course examines some of the stories, images, ideas, and institutions of medieval England. We willtest how race helps us think about the articulation and operationalization of human difference between thetwelfth and fourteenth centuries, especially with respect to Jews, Saracens (a term created by Christians to referto Arabs and Muslims of varying ethnicities), and the so called "monstrous races" who were thought to populatethe far reaches of the world. We'll ask - How did geography, religion, and history come to be corporealized, orunderstood as legible on the body? How did the essentialization of differences between groups act to satisfydesires, or seemingly to solve intellectual and ideological difficulties? How does "thinking with race" in medievalEngland throw new light on race and racism today? Readings will be both in Middle English and modernEnglish translation. No previous experience with medieval literature is expected. This is a 2018-19 CollegeSignature Course. (Pre-1650)Instructor(s): Julie Orlemanski Terms Offered: SpringEquivalent Course(s): "

Some Versions of Apocalypse. 100 Units.The end of the world is one of the most durable of mankind's obsessions, from prophetic texts of antiquity totoday's fascination with zombie plagues, environmental disaster, and nuclear winter. In this course we willexplore what is both fearful and alluring about catastrophe on an unimaginable scale, as we read and view someparadigmatic apocalyptic works across a wide historical range. The course will focus on close attention to theaesthetics of individual works, locating those works in their historical contexts, and the conceptual analysis of thetexts' motivating concerns. We will especially attend to the relationship between aesthetic form and the political,economic, and subjective forms that mediate catastrophe--as well as the ways that the end of things asks us tothink beyond mediation. Texts include the biblical Book of Revelation, William Langland's medieval allegoryPiers Plowman, Daniel Defoe's early modern chronicle of the black death A Journal of the Plague Year, CormacMcCarthy's postapocalyptic novel The Road, and both the novel and film versions of World War Z.

How does horror reflect, contribute to, or intervene into structures of racism,sexism, xenophobia, and queerphobia? How do fictional texts represent or transform non-fictional horrors, fromlynching to rape to police brutality? And what is the status of horror as an emotion that structures relationsof power and privilege in the United States? Together, we will gain a historical perspective on the genre, forinstance tracking the figure of the zombie from its birth in Haitian folklore as a projection of the horrors ofslavery, through 20th century works like George Romero's film Night of the Living Dead, and into present dayworks including Colson Whitehead's novel Zone One. We will pay special attention to the present moment,interrogating a renaissance of horror tropes in, for instance, feminist fiction (Karen Russell and Carmen MariaMachado), television (American Horror Story and Stranger Things), and cinema (It and Get Out).Instructor(s): Michael Dango Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): "

London Program: Literature and the Environment in Eighteenth-Century Britain. 100 Units.This course will focus on eighteenth-century literature that engages us with the nonhuman environment-with the plants, animals, and elements, the landscapes and the climates that surround and shape humanlife. We will range widely in genres from nature poetry and travel writing to natural history and the novel,reflecting throughout on the ways in which nature may be cultivated, improved, or imported from elsewhere- not something opposed to human culture but wholly tied up with it. Together, we will ask: how do ideas ofnature look different in the city, the country, or the colonies? And crucially, what might eighteenth centuryunderstandings of the relationship between human beings and the natural world have to tell us our own momentof ecological entanglement and crisis?

Frazer's TheGolden Bough, a foundational work in the anthropology of magic, religion, purity, pollution, sacrifice, fertility,and the death and reincarnation of gods. Reading Frazer's work alongside works by William Butler Yeats, T.S.Eliot, Ezra Pound, H.D., Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Robert Graves, Sigmund Freud,and Jane Harrison, we will examine the widespread impact of Frazer's tome, its resonance in the tumultuouswar years, and the ways in which it participated in the creation of pagan, heretical, outsider, country, rural, andethnic values in modernist London. Inasmuch as Frazer's work possessed a literary life, we will examine how itsanthropology possessed by literature lives on in the works of such anthropologists as Mary Douglas and MichaelTaussig.

In this course, we will explore and expandupon this idea, seeking to understand the ways in which London's cosmopolitan and prominent history dependupon England's imperial endeavors. This pursuit will also involve representations of the city "from the outside,"such as Samuel Selvon's The Lonely Londoners and Tayeb Salih'sSeason of Migration.

Is human choicegoverned by reason, or are our wills overruled by our own passions-or by divine grace? Can self-determinationgenuinely arise in political or physical systems determined by history? What does it mean to depict free choice?Questions like these shaped crucial Renaissance debates in parliaments and churches, in laboratories and in thearts.

Luxury and Global Modernism. 100 Units.The desire for and consumption of luxury is central to the world-building enterprise of capitalist modernity aswe understand it, from the elaboration of colonial trade routes to the emergence of the era-defining aestheticmode known as glamor. As both the object of the primitivizing imaginary of colonial social science and themotor of excitement for the new in the modern Western city, luxury infused some of the complexities of globalinterconnectedness into the imagination and the arts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. With readingsacross the literary, but also the material-cultural and social-scientific archives of Western and non-Westernmodernisms, this course asks how luxury might open new avenues for the study of modernism's inherentlyglobal character. Course texts will include literary works by Henry James, Djuna Barnes, Mina Loy, and MP Shiel;social scientific works by Marcel Mauss and Georges Bataille; visual works by Raghubir Singh, Coco Chanel,and Josephine Baker; theoretical readings from the fields of postcolonial, queer, and fashion studies.

Signs of the Americas. 100 Units.It is a common misconception that literature can happen only in the alphabet or that such non-alphabeticalliteratures have long ago ceased to be made. This course corrects such misconceptions by exploring modernand contemporary literatures that have been written with, or in response to, such sign-systems as pictographs,hieroglyphs, totem poles, wampum, and khipu. Focusing especially on the sign-systems of the native Americas,this class gives students a basic introduction to the mechanics of these signs, in order to discuss how thesemechanics might be at play in the works of such poets, writers, and artists as Anni Albers, Simon Ortiz,Gerald Vizenor, Louise Erdrich, John Borrows, Charles Olson, Bill Reid, Robert Bringhurst, Fred Wah, ClaytonEshleman, Cy Twombly, Joaquín Torres-Garcia, Cecilia Vicuña, and others. Key questions to be asked include:how are these signs an interface for contemporary histories of nation and capital? And: how do those materialhistories and their identifications in race, gender, kinship, and ecology change when cast in the mechanics,tropes, and figures of these signs?

In addition to providing informationon the history of life, phylogenies are fundamental to modern methods for studying macroevolutionary andmacroecological pattern and process. In the biological sciences, phylogenies are most often inferred from geneticdata. In paleobiology, phylogenies can only be inferred from the fossilized remains of morphological structures,and collecting and analyzing morphological data present a different set of challenges. In this course, studentswill study both traditional and state-of-the-art approaches to inferring phylogenies in the fossil record, fromdata collection to interpretation. Lectures will explore the statistical underpinnings of phylogenetic methods, aswell as their practical implementation in commonly used software.

It seeks to foster precise and thoughtful pursuit of basicquestions by means of (1) rigorous training in the interpretation of important texts, supported by (2) extensivetraining in at least one foreign language, and by (3) the acquisition of the knowledge, approaches, and skills ofconventional disciplines: historical, religious, literary, scientific, political, and philosophical.RationaleA richly informed question or concern formulated by each student guides the reading of texts. Classic textsare also informed by such questions; for example, Socrates asks: What is virtue? What is the good? What isjustice? Aristotle and Cicero explore the relation of civic friendship to society. Freud asks: What is happiness?Can humans be happy? Milton investigates how poetic vocation may be related to political responsibility.Students who are engaged by these questions and others like them, and who find them both basic and urgent,may wish to continue to explore them more thoroughly and deeply within the structure of the program whichprovides the wherewithal to address them on a high level.That wherewithal is to be found in the fundamental or classic texts (historical, religious, literary, scientific,political, and philosophical) in which the great writers articulate and examine questions in different andcompeting ways. These books illuminate the persisting questions and speak to contemporary concerns becausethey are both the originators and exacting critics of our current opinions. These texts serve as colleagues whochallenge us to think that something else might actually be the case than what we already think. The mostimportant questions may, at bottom, be the most contested, and those most susceptible to, and most requiring,sustained, probing engagement.This program emphasizes the firsthand experience and knowledge of major texts, read and reread andreread again. Because they are difficult and complex, only a small number of such works can be studied. Yetthe program proposes that intensively studying a profound work and incorporating it into one's thought andimagination prepares one for reading any important book or reflecting on any important issue. Read rapidly,such books are merely assimilated into preexisting experience and opinions; read intensively, they can transformand deepen experience and thought.Studying fundamental texts is, by itself, not enough. Even to understand the texts themselves, supportingstudies and training are necessary: a solid foundation in at least one foreign language and in disciplines andsubject matters pertinent to the main questions of students are essential parts of the major. Students benefitfrom knowledge of the historical contexts out of which certain problems emerged or in which authors wrote;knowledge of specific subject matters and methods; knowledge of the language in which a text was originallywritten, as well as an understanding of the shape a given language imparts to a given author; fundamental skillsof analysis, gathering evidence, reasoning, and criticism; different approaches and perspectives of conventionaldisciplines. All these are integral parts of the educational task.Individual Program DesignGenuine questions cannot be assigned to a student; they must arise from within. For this reason, a setcurriculum is not imposed upon students. Each student's course of study must answer to his or her interests andconcerns, and must begin from a distinctive concern. One student may be exercised about questions of scienceand religion; another about freedom and determinism; another about friendship and conversation; another byprudence, romance, and marriage; a fifth about distributive justice. Through close work with a suitably chosenfaculty adviser, a student determines texts, text and author courses, and supporting courses as appropriateto address the student's Fundamentals question. Beginning with a student's questions and interests does not,however, imply an absence of standards or rigor; this program is most demanding.Activities of GraduatesThe Fundamentals program serves the purposes of liberal education, regarded as an end in itself, and offersno specific pre-professional training; yet Fundamentals graduates have successfully prepared for careers in theprofessions and in scholarship. Some are now pursuing work in law, medicine, journalism, ministry, governmentservice, business, veterinary medicine, and secondary school teaching. Others have gone on to graduate schoolsin numerous fields, including classics, English, comparative literature, Slavic, history, philosophy, social thought,theology, religious studies, clinical psychology, political science, development economics, mathematics, filmstudies, and education.FacultyThe faculty of the Fundamentals program comprises humanists and social scientists, representing interestsand competencies in both the East and the West and scholarship in matters ancient and modern. This diversityand pluralism exists within a common agreement about the primacy of fundamental questions and the centralityof important books and reading them well. The intention is for the students to see and work with a variety of2018-2019 The College            385scholars presenting their approaches to and understanding of books that they love, that they know well, and thatare central to their ongoing concerns.Application to the ProgramStudents should apply in Spring Quarter of their first year to enter the program in their second year; thegoals and requirements of the program are best met if students spend three years in the major. Students areinterviewed and counseled in order to discover whether or not their interests and intellectual commitmentswould be best served by this program. Admissions are decided on the basis of the application statement,interviews, and previous academic performance.Program RequirementsThe Fundamentals program comprises (a) 13 courses, (b) the Junior Paper, and (c) the Senior Exam, for atotal of 1500 units.A. Course Work1.Gateway Course (1 course) (Autumn Quarter or Winter Quarter): This course is specifically designedfor the incoming cohort of Fundamentals students and is a mandatory part of the program. It is devoted tothe close reading of one or two texts or the works of a single author, chosen because they raise challengingquestions and present important and competing answers. Through this course, students will study a varietyof ways in which a text can respond to their concerns and can compel consideration of its own questions.2.Text/Author Courses (7 courses). The seven Text/Author courses are devoted to the study of one ortwo particular texts or the work of a particular author. Text/Author courses are generally cross-listed asFNDL courses in Class Search (http://registrar.uchicago.edu/classes); if a relevant course is not cross-listed,the student should contact the coordinator to see if it can be counted towards the major. In years when theGateway Course is offered in Autumn Quarter, entering students are required to take at least one Text/Author course in Winter Quarter; in years when the Gateway Course is offered in Winter Quarter, enteringstudents are expected to take at least one Text/Author course in Autumn Quarter.The Text/Author Courses and the Gateway Course—eight courses total—give each student the opportunityto develop a list of six texts that will become the basis of his or her Senior Exam (see below). This listshould contain works in the area of the student's primary interest that examine that interest from diverseperspectives. One of the six must be studied in an original language other than English, the same languagein which the student establishes competency (any exceptions must be approved by the chair).3.Supporting Courses (4 courses). These are courses that complement the student's program, providinghistorical context, theoretical and methodological training, or other complements. They do not have to belisted as FNDL to satisfy this requirement, but they must be explicitly identified as supporting courses inconsultation with the student's adviser.4.Foreign Language (1 course). Students in the program are expected to achieve a level of proficiency ina foreign language sufficient to enable them to study in the original language (other than English) one of thetexts on their examination list. Such training ordinarily requires two years of formal language instruction orits equivalent. The third quarter of the second year of the language is counted toward the major. In addition,students are required to take a course where they study a text in that language; the instructor of the coursemay be asked to provide an evaluation of the student's linguistic proficiency on the basis of this work.Students and instructors should work closely together in determining how the student will demonstratecompentency in the language. As the achievement of proficiency may differ vis-à-vis length of study fromlanguage to language, it may prove harder for students of some languages to read a text in its entirety evenafter completing two years of instruction. Any students who believe that their language is so difficult thatdoing so is unrealistic may petition to have the requirement met by reading a clearly marked-out portion ofthe text—perhaps a chapter or two, or series of smaller sections. To be considered, the petition must set out aclear plan and must be signed by the instructor of the text in question.B. The Junior PaperIn the Winter or Spring Quarter of their junior year, students write an extended essay called the Junior Paper.This project provides the opportunity for students to originate and formulate a serious inquiry into an importantissue arising out of their work and to pursue the inquiry extensively and in depth in a paper of about twenty totwenty-five pages (roughly 8,000 to 10,000 words). At every stage in the preparation of the paper, students workclosely with their Fundamentals faculty adviser. Students register in the independent study course "

ENST 2250,"6. The Natures of the Factory Farm. 100 Units.This course looks at the culture, technology, politics, and ecology of industrial agriculture through the lens ofthe animal-based "factory" farm. Over the quarter we will trace key steps along the process of manufacturingindustrialized animals from life to death in order to think about the factory farm's logic, value, and consequencesfor rural environments (primarily) within the United States. By emphasizing the historical and culturalconditions of possibility that enable the modern-day factory farm, this course illustrates how mass-producinglife forms is more than just a matter of technology, profit-making, or necessity. Instead, we will see how legaldefinitions of the "farm" versus the "factory," ideological notions of animal (and human) "nature," labor law,animal confinement, and the corporate ownership of genetic breeds contribute to its growing ascendancy as aglobal norm of animal production. But the factory farm has also led to new ideals for rural life that go far beyondclassic forms of American agrarianism. As such, we will look to a series of case studies that take up the ecologicalpolitics of heritage-breed animals, raw milk production, and recent (Europe-based) projects that try to redeemcertain elements of industrial agriculture. Along the way, students will receive an introduction to the analysis offood chains, applied ethology, animal studies, agrarian studies, and rural environmental politics.Instructor(s): A.

ENST 2365,"0. Revolutionizing Agriculture: Early Modern Technologies for the New Millennium. 100 Units.Based on a wave of sustainable and organic farming technologies that have reinvented early modern growingpractices, this course integrates USDA reports and modern field and lab studies into the historiography of TheBritish Agricultural Revolution. Not all historical technologies were sustainable, and this course relies uponmodern agronomy to evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of the farming improvements that definedthe British Agricultural Revolution. We similarly explore primary historical sources and historiography to betterunderstand the environmental limits of the technologies used by organic and sustainable farmers today. Bybringing the science and history into discourse, we will take a critical look at the British Agricultural Revolution,which is thought to have facilitated the Industrial Revolution by accumulating capital for investment and byallowing England to feed a growing urban population and manufacturing sector without a significant increasein arable acres. We know that yields per acre per worker did increase, but this is the only aspect of the story thatremains unquestioned. Some agricultural improvement technologies, like light plowing and enclosure, causedcatastrophic environmental harms that ultimately lowered yields over time.

PBPL 2365,"00. Revolutionizing Agriculture: Early Modern Technologies for the New Millennium. 100 Units.Based on a wave of sustainable and organic farming technologies that have reinvented early modern growingpractices, this course integrates USDA reports and modern field and lab studies into the historiography of TheBritish Agricultural Revolution. Not all historical technologies were sustainable, and this course relies uponmodern agronomy to evaluate the environmental costs and benefits of the farming improvements that definedthe British Agricultural Revolution. We similarly explore primary historical sources and historiography to betterunderstand the environmental limits of the technologies used by organic and sustainable farmers today. Bybringing the science and history into discourse, we will take a critical look at the British Agricultural Revolution,which is thought to have facilitated the Industrial Revolution by accumulating capital for investment and byallowing England to feed a growing urban population and manufacturing sector without a significant increasein arable acres. We know that yields per acre per worker did increase, but this is the only aspect of the story thatremains unquestioned. Some agricultural improvement technologies, like light plowing and enclosure, causedcatastrophic environmental harms that ultimately lowered yields over time. Other technologies like The NorfolkRotation may have had small and gradual impacts over time and cannot be easily correlated with increases inyields on a site-by-site basis in the historical literature or in modern field trials. Other early modern technologieshave proven to be more beneficial than previously thought. How can a better understanding of this historyinform farming practices today?Equivalent Course(s): "

It starts witha general outlook of current worldwide explosive urbanization and associated changes in social, economic andenvironmental indicators. It then introduces a number of historical models, from sociology, economics andgeography that have been proposed to understand how cities operate. We will discuss how these and otherfacets of cities can be integrated as dynamical complex systems and derive their general characteristics as socialnetworks embedded in structured physical spaces. Resulting general properties of cities will be illustrated indifferent geographic and historical contexts, including an understanding of urban resource flows, emergentinstitutions and the division of labor and knowledge as drivers of innovation and economic growth.

Certainly, politics will operatethrough established institutions such as elections and legislatures. But popular politics may also take otherforms: petitions, social movements, protest in the streets, and cultural critique. These efforts often fail, sometimesdramatically, but they have also contributed to major social change including the abolition of slavery, theexpansion of rights, and demands for new understandings of justice. This course will explore the history ofpopular politics within democratizing societies, the development of new forms of collective mobilization andtechnologies of political influence, and the changing relation of popular politics to formal political institutions.Instructor(s): E.

In contrast to the national level, the smaller scale and dense diversity of cities is thought to encouragethe development of civic solutions that work for the many. But cities are inhabited by distinct groups of peoplewith divergent interests and varied beliefs about how to address countless urban issues, such as creating jobs,delivering education, ensuring safe neighborhoods, promoting environmental sustainability, and taking careof the vulnerable. Many groups and organizations have an interest in the outcomes of these processes. Sometake action to try to shape them to their own advantage, while others have few chances to make themselvesheard.

ENST 2720,"1. Food Security and Agriculture: Calumet. 100 Units.Do you know where your next meal will come from? Many people around the world, and even close tohome, do not. The Food and Agricultural Organization explains that food security exists when all people,at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet theirdietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. Food security is thus a complex issueinvolving aspects of food production and distribution, poverty, buying power, and social networks, andcultural choice. In this course we use the Calumet region as a case study to examine some aspects of the foodsecurity debate, especially the basic conceptual divide between the framework of food security, as defined byinternational organizations above, and the more grass-roots notion of food sovereignty. Though we will aimfor an overview of the issues, we focus this quarter more specifically on issues of agriculture and the foodsystem, including urban agriculture, permaculture, and other challenges to the dominant industrial model.In a region with significant economic distress and area of "food desert," the Calumet presents examples ofboth challenge and response to this critical topic.Instructor(s): K.

Keller Terms Offered: Spring1. Food Security and Agriculture: Calumet. 100 Units.Do you know where your next meal will come from? Many people around the world, and even close to home,do not. The Food and Agricultural Organization explains that food security exists when all people, at all times,have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs andfood preferences for an active and healthy life. Food security is thus a complex issue involving aspects of foodproduction and distribution, poverty, buying power, and social networks, and cultural choice. In this coursewe use the Calumet region as a case study to examine some aspects of the food security debate, especially thebasic conceptual divide between the framework of food security, as defined by international organizations above,and the more grass-roots notion of food sovereignty. Though we will aim for an overview of the issues, wefocus this quarter more specifically on issues of agriculture and the food system, including urban agriculture,permaculture, and other challenges to the dominant industrial model. In a region with significant economicdistress and area of "food desert," the Calumet presents examples of both challenge and response to this criticaltopic.Instructor(s): K.

Freshwater Ecosystems of the Calumet Region. 100 Units.The Calumet region contains a wide range of important freshwater ecosystems. The Great Lakes are possiblythe world's most valuable freshwater ecosystem, while the Kankakee marshes previously supported a massivediversity and abundance of waterfowl and other native species. Since European colonization most of the marshesof the Calumet region have been drained for agriculture, urbanization, or to create new land for industry.All remaining freshwater ecosystems in the Calumet region, including Lake Michigan, have been affected byinvasive species, chemical pollution, overfishing, and numerous other factors. This course examines the historyof impacts on the extent and functioning of freshwater ecosystems in the Calumet region. Particular attentionis paid to the pre-European state of Calumet freshwaters, the impacts of land-use change and invasive species,and the prospects for restoration. The entire course is framed within the context of the economic conditionsthat allowed freshwater habitats in the Calumet region to be so strongly modified and how current economicconditions affect the likely future of these ecosystems.Terms Offered: Spring1.

Babylon and the Origins of Knowledge. 100 Units.In 1946 the famed economist John Maynard Keynes declared that Isaac Newton "was the last of the magicians,the last of the Babylonians." We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, IbnKhaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful andreverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in thehistorical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself.

The main task of this course will be to presentPhenomenology's main concepts and the meaning of Phenomenology's transformations from Husserl toHeidegger, Sartre, Levinas and Henry. The fundamental credo of Phenomenology consists in the emphasis laidupon phenomena given to consciousness. This emphasis coincides with the "return to things in themselves" asformulated by Husserl. What can this kind of return actually mean? And what does this claim suggest aboutphilosophical practices prior to phenomenology, idealism or empiricism? In what way, for Husserl, was classicalphilosophy not able to give access to things such as they are truly given? And what is the meaning of such idea of« givenness »?

History of Philosophy III: Kant and the 19th Century. 100 Units.The philosophical ideas and methods of Immanuel Kant's "critical" philosophy set off a revolution thatreverberated through 19th-century philosophy. We will trace the effects of this revolution and the responses toit, focusing on the changing conception of what philosophical ethics might hope to achieve. We will begin with aconsideration of Kant's famous Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals, in which the project of grounding allethical obligations in the very idea of rational freedom is announced. We will then consider Hegel's radicalizationof this project in his Philosophy of Right, which seeks to derive from the idea of rational freedom, not just formalconstraints on right action, but a determinate, positive conception of what Hegel calls "ethical life". We willconclude with an examination of three very different critics of the Kantian/Hegelian project in ethical theory: KarlMarx, John Stuart Mill, and Friedrich Nietzsche.Instructor(s): M.

Throughout the quarter, we will read short fiction froma variety of Russian authors and examine the texts that establish the tradition of Russian short fiction as wellas those that push its boundaries. This course will serve as a general survey of Russian Literature, as well as afocused introduction to a particular genre in that tradition.

Media and Power in the Age of Putin and Trump. 100 Units.Over the past 200 years, various political and cultural regimes of Russia have systematically exploited the gapbetween experience and representation to create their own mediated worlds--from the tight censorship of theimperial and Soviet periods to the propaganda of the Soviet period and the recent use of media simulacra forstrategic geopolitical advantage. During this same period state control of media has been used to seclude Russiafrom the advancement of liberalism, market economics, individual rights, modernist art, Freud, Existentialism,and, more recently, Western discourses of inclusion, sustainability, and identity. Examining this history, it issometimes difficult to discern whether the architects of Russian culture have been hopelessly backward orshrewd phenomenologists, keenly aware of the relativity of experience and of their ability to shape it. Thiscourse will explore the worlds that these practices produce, with an emphasis on Russia's recent confrontationswith Western culture and power, and including various practices of subversion of media control, such as illegalprinting and circulation.

Gendering Privacy. 100 Units.Interest in privacy has surged in recent decades in light of the emergence of Big Data, the rise of increasinglysophisticated methods of surveillance, and the ubiquity of networked social media in everyday life. Yet privacyremains a notoriously slippery concept to pin down-across disciplines, privacy has been conceptualizedvariously as a legal right, a psychological state of being, a set of preferences, and a boundary-making process. Inthis course, we take a sociological approach to privacy, starting with the notion that privacy is at once a decidedly"micro" individual phenomenon and at the same time a product of "macro" social-structural forces. Thus,while privacy preferences can vary from person to person, the capacity to achieve privacy is shaped by socialposition (e.g., race, class, gender, etc.). In this course, we focus specifically on how women and men experiencepossibilities for privacy and how these experiences are shaped by their racial and class location. We will drawon a range of theoretical perspectives, including feminist theory, critical legal theory, and critical race theoryto examine privacy through the lens of social inequality. Empirically, we will investigate how the twin systemsof welfare and criminal justice present challenges to privacy for men and women living in poverty. The mainquestions guiding our inquiry include: Who gets to have privacy (and who doesn't), why, and at what costs?Instructor(s): C. Hughes Terms Offered: Winter"

GNSE 2360,"3. Grace, Love, and Pleasure. Painting in Eighteenth Century France. 100 Units.The easing of political life and the relaxation of private morals which came to characterize the long reign of LouisXV (1715-1774) was mirrored by the development of a new conception of art, an art more intimate, decorative,generally amorous, and often erotic. It is these last two related dimensions which are the basis of a new visualaesthetic which constitutes the subject matter of this course. Through the exploration of contemporary novels andtheater, as well as contemporary critical and philosophical writings, we will demonstrate how both the sensualand the erotic become essential components of the century's cultural ethos. Artistic subjects, the mechanismsto represent them, their metaphorical stakes, and their phenomenological effects on the beholder will thereforebe considered as the expression of a particular historical and ideological context. It is in this context that lovebecame the symbol of a king who privileged peace against war, and where emotional pleasure triumphed overmoralizing values and asserted itself as a new aesthetic category.Instructor(s): S.

HIST 2860,"4, 7. War, Diplomacy, and Empire in US History. 100 Units.World politics have profoundly shaped the United States from its colonial origins to the war on terror. Yet onlyrecently have US historians made a sustained effort to relate the foreign relations of the country to its domestichistory. For a century and a half prior to independence, empire, trade, great-power politics, and violent conflictwith Native Americans formed the large structures of power and meaning within which colonists pursuedtheir everyday lives. In violently repudiating the claims of the British Empire, the revolutionaries commenced apolitical tradition that sought to avoid the perils of great-power statecraft for roughly the next century and a half.Yet even as it lent a distinctive cast to US politics and society, this pursuit of exceptionalism had to reckon withthe requirements of state power and geopolitics from the Civil War onward. With its sudden embrace of great-power politics and the "rise to globalism" from WWII onward the United States became increasingly like theEuropean societies it had repudiated at the founding, even as its exceptional military and economic power set itapart as a "unipolar power" by the turn of the millennium. To understand these developments in depth studentswill write two modest-length "deep-dive" analytical essays and three brief reports on targeted expeditions intoprimary materials, while reading broadly across the historiography of the new diplomatic and internationalhistory.Instructor(s): J.

GRMN 2231,"2. Reforming Religious Media: Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. 100 Units.The Protestant Reformation began with a carefully orchestrated media event, when Martin Luther posted his95 theses on the door of a church in Wittenberg. Concurrently, he resorted to the still new medium of print todisseminate more widely his scathing critique of the Catholic Church's use of indulgences to communicateGod's grace. This was only the beginning of Luther's sweeping attack on the Church's role as the sole mediatorof salvation. No religious medium or communicational practice remained unquestioned, resulting in theircomprehensive reform. Soon other reformers joined in, pushing the critique even further by questioning the needand validity of all religious mediation. Approaching the Protestant Reformation as a reform of religious media,this lecture course will give particular attention to the congenial alliance between Martin Luther's religiousmessage and the emerging technology of the printing press, the role of Scripture in legitimating Protestanttheologies of communication, controversies around particular religious media like images or the eucharist, andthe role of direct inspiration in radical reformers. This course will be taught in lecture format.Instructor(s): Christopher Wild Terms Offered: Spring428         Germanic Studies"

Its main task is to understand how sites, objects, and conceptscontribute to worldwide connections, from ecological concerns to human rights campaigns. Students majoringin Global Studies will take courses throughout the College, often with particular interests in Anthropology,Environmental Studies, History, or a specific regional study.Instead of beginning with “global” and “local," the typical categories of globalization studies, the GlobalStudies program contends that the distinctions between sites and trends, between objects far and near, andbetween the cosmopolitan and the vernacular emerge from empirical studies. Students are encouraged toexercise close attention to mundane practices, everyday materialities, and lived experiences. With a goodgrounding in case studies, students in the program are expected to be able to reflect upon the implications oftheir research interests, both inside and outside the classroom. Students carry these interests on to a variety ofcareers and professional opportunities following graduation.Program RequirementsStudents must complete a total of 13 courses (including one approved elective and two BA seminars), aresearch activity, and a language requirement, broken down in the following manner:Introductory Courses (2 courses)All students are required to take the two-quarter introductory sequence to the major, "

Studentsare expected to complete the sequence in their second year, if possible, especially if they plan to study abroadduring their third year.Thematic Tracks (8 courses)The body of the major (eight courses in all) is comprised of courses selected from four overlapping thematictracks of study. Students will select two tracks, a primary and a secondary one, and complete five courses inthe former and three in the latter. The selection of the primary and secondary tracks should be linked to thestudent’s BA research interests. The tracks are outlined below with sample classes that might fall within eachcategory, but more detailed information about these tracks may be found on the Global Studies website (http://globalstudies.uchicago.edu).Bodies and NatureThis track focuses on bodily nature (broadly construed) and ecological relationships. Particular attentionis paid to environmental and health-related topics, and not always with a focus on human beings.Themes could range from sustainability, ecotourism, and pandemics to modern beauty practices, healthmovements, and animal studies.1-23102Global Studies I-II200Five courses in a primary thematic track500Three courses in a secondary thematic track3001-23102.

The final version of the BA thesis is due by the secondFriday of the quarter in which the student plans to graduate. Successful completion of the thesis requires apassing grade from the faculty reader.The Global Studies major thesis must be clearly organized around a contemporary global issue. Studentsmay double-major, but double-majoring with another program that also requires a BA thesis would entail (a) thesecond major's program accepting the Global Studies thesis as fulfilling that program's BA requirements or (b)the student completing an additional BA thesis for the second major.Regardless of the requirements of the second major, Global Studies majors are required to complete bothquarters of the fourth-year BA seminar. Thesis seminars from other major programs will not count toward theGlobal Studies BA Thesis Seminar requirement.Foreign Language RequirementThe Global Studies language requirement can be completed in two ways:1.Students may complete the equivalent of a seventh quarter of language study in a single language.Credit for the seventh and final quarter of the language must be earned by University of Chicago courseregistration.

GLST 2411,"0. In the Beginning": Origin Stories in Science and Religion. 100 Units.What is the origin of the universe? What is the origin of humanity? These questions have generated a plethora ofanswers, many of which fall within domains of what we now consider to be science and religion. However, as wewill see through our readings, these two categories are hard to define; classifications often overlap, and scienceand religion intertwine throughout history and until today. What do we call "myth," and what do we term"theory"? In this class, we will focus on not only the cultural embeddedness of religious and scientific narratives,but also the cultural implications of these texts. The course begins with origin stories and asks students toconsider their power in shaping our world and perspectives, focusing on the ethical dimensions and implicationsof these narratives. What kind of relationships do we imagine among human beings, and between humanand nonhuman beings in this world, given particular origin stories as our starting point? Finally, in relation tothis goal of interrogating the ethical import of origin narratives, this course will close by asking whether wecan imagine other kinds of origin stories (such as in the genre of science fiction), and what implications theseimaginal narratives hold.Instructor(s): Sartell, Elizabeth Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): 1. Medical Knowledge in the Islamicate World. 100 Units.Drawing on Marshall Hodgson's term 'Islamicate' this course follows medical knowledge as a cultural andpolitical object as it travels through various iterations across and between dynastic and modern colonial imperialformations. For students of Islamic studies, the course suggests how medical knowledge can be a point ofdeparture for illuminating intellectual, social and political history. For students of globalization, it situatesthat phenomenon's association with the space-time compressions of capitalism within a longer genealogy ofmigrations and knowledge exchanges. The course asks students to engage with several fundamental questions:Why was the medical knowledge produced in Greek antiquity absorbed and transformed by the Islamicateworld? How did this medical knowledge change in translation between languages and across regionally specificcultural assemblages? How might close attention to the historically situated practices of medical knowledgeproduction disrupt an essentialist understanding of 'Islamic culture'? Ultimately, the central aim of this course isto urge students to think more deeply about the methods and sources for understanding the entangled historiesof the Islamicate world.Instructor(s): Datoo, Sabrina Terms Offered: Spring2. Global Food. 100 Units.Do you know where the food you had for breakfast this morning came from? Who produced it? Where itwas made? How far it travelled to make its way to your table? This class begins from the observation that theeveryday act of eating is often a global practice in contemporary societies. From the international circulation ofmega-brands like Coca-Cola, to the migrant labor that harvests much of America's fresh produce, food providesa vantage-point for examining global connections. These connections are often produced through food: suchas eating foreign cuisines, or receiving the international distribution of humanitarian food aid. Taking food asits central object, this class examines issues of the 'global' related to labor, political economy, biotechnology,humanitarian aid, nutrition science, brands and marketing, as well as everyday consumption and meaning-making. We will ask questions about the global politics of food, such as: How are global conditions of foodproduction structured and organized? How do people make sense of global commodities within their own socialworlds, and how do they use them to imagine connections with distant others? How are scientific concepts ofnutrition and obesity made to circulate globally, and what impact do these ideas have in the places where theyare exported? How do people imagine culture in relation to food, and what meanings is food given in contexts ofcosmopolitanism and diaspora?Instructor(s): Butler, Ella Terms Offered: Spring"

We will consider three major concepts-"extinction", "disaster" and"dystopia" to see how they can be used to frame issues of environmental and ecological concern. Each conceptwill act as a framing device for issues such as conservation and preservation of wildlife, erasure of adivasi (firstdwellers) ways of life, environmental justice, water scarcity and climate change. The course will aim to developstudents' ability to assess the specificity of these concepts in different disciplines. For example: What methodsand sources will an environmental historian use to write about wildlife? How does this differ from the approachan ecologist or literary writer might take?

The Harem: Gender, Family and Power in Early Modern and Modern South Asia. 100 Units.Even today, the word "harem" evokes orientalist imaginings of an exotic east. Popular images drawn fromcolonial-era representations continue to define our understanding of this complex institution. In this coursewe will work to complicate this understanding through considering the harem as a site of interplay betweengender, family ties, and power. Taking into account influences from the larger Islamicate world as well as morelocal, Indic practices, we will historicize the harem, tracking its changes over the course of this long period, andcritiquing its various (mis)representations. We will explore how the harem constituted a diverse space includingnot only elite women and their male relatives, but also other figures such as slave girls, eunuchs and guards. Wewill furthermore look at how this space was transformed in the era of European expansionism and colonial rulein the subcontinent, becoming a flash point over questions of social reform and Indian nationalism. Materials willinclude not just secondary literature but also excerpts from contemporary historical accounts, paintings, shortstories, photographs, and films. No prior knowledge of South Asian history required.Equivalent Course(s): 2. India between Empires: Regions, Remembrance, and Representation. 100 Units.This is a course on South Asia in transition. It is also a course on the representation of that transition. The MughalEmpire-which had been the dominant power in India for nearly two hundred years-underwent a process ofdecentralization in the early eighteenth century. The ensuing years saw the rise of regional powers across muchof the Indian subcontinent; some modeled their institutions of state on those of the weakened Mughal center,while others asserted their sovereignty by cultivating a distinctive identity. Although the British East IndiaCompany would gradually integrate these polities into its expanding network of political and economic interests,the memory of the once-grand Mughal Empire and its mighty regional heirs loomed large over the colonialexperience and endures today.Instructor(s): Andrew Halladay Terms Offered: Autumn770         South Asian Languages and Civilizations"

Majoring in history not only enables you to become aconsumer of academic knowledge, it also prepares you to become a producer of knowledge. Undergraduatehistory courses first train you to explore large-scale social, cultural, and political processes by defining concrete,researchable questions. Subsequently, as a history major, you are taught how to locate the primary and secondarysources necessary to develop answers to these questions. Finally, faculty assist you in transforming yourresearch into historical arguments that shed light on the multiple ways in which our world, our very reality, hastransformed over time. History is excellent preparation for a wide field of endeavors—from law, government,and public policy to the arts and business.Students interested in a history major should consult the associate director before the end of their second year; it is,however, possible to join the major as a third-year student.Program RequirementsIn addition to the civilization sequences, students can choose from more than eighty history courses thatare offered each year to undergraduates. Some of these are introductory lectures ("Gateway courses"), others aresmall seminars devoted to the intense study of a particular historical moment, theme, or event. Students musttake twelve courses for the history major, one of which must be a history colloquium ("

Studentsmay use one civilization sequence (up to three courses in the same sequence) to count toward history majorrequirements, but only if these courses are not also being used to count toward general education requirements.Major FieldStudents in both the Research Track and the Regular Track are required to take six courses in, or directlyrelated to, their chosen main field. Students construct the main field and choose their other courses in closeconsultation with the associate director, subject to final approval by the faculty chair of the UndergraduateStudies Committee.The major field is usually defined by time and space. Examples are nineteenth- or twentieth-century UShistory, colonial Africa, the Atlantic world in the early modern or modern period, ancient Greece, or medievalEurope. Thematic major fields are also possible; for example, African American, Jewish, or gender history. Majorfields may also be methodologically defined: for example, intellectual, economic, gender, political, or urbanhistory. Students pursuing a major field in urban history, for example, might take courses ranging from "JewishSpaces and Places: Imagined and Real" to "Cities from Scratch: The History of Urban Latin America"; a focus oneconomic history might include "Economic Change in China" and "The History of US Capitalism." In the caseof thematically or methodologically defined major fields, it is particularly important to consult closely with theassociate director to ensure coherence.ElectivesIn addition to the six courses in the main field, students must also take a number of elective courses.Students pursuing the Regular Track take six electives, while students pursuing the Research Track take fourelectives and complete the major with two seminars for the BA thesis (See Research Track below). Electivesshould complement the main field, extend the range of your historical awareness, and explore varyingapproaches to historical analysis and interpretation. You are encouraged to take courses that introduce significantcivilizational or chronological breadth into your studies, or a different methodology or theme than you arestudying in your major field.Research Colloquium (1 and 29802)Students pursuing the Research Track are required to complete a BA thesis and the two BA thesis seminars.The BA thesis is a three-quarter-long research project in which students develop a significant and originalinterpretation of a historical issue of their choosing. Theses are the culmination of the history program andrange from forty to sixty pages in length. The BA thesis seminars assist students in formulating approaches anddeveloping their research and writing skills, while providing a forum for group discussion and critiques.Students formally register for two quarters, during the Spring Quarter of their third year (1 BAThesis Seminar I) and Winter Quarter of their fourth year (2 BA Thesis Seminar II), though they arealso expected to be actively engaged during the intervening Autumn Quarter. Students who are out of residencein Spring Quarter of their third year, take BA Seminar I in Autumn Quarter of their fourth year (see StudyAbroad below). BA Thesis Seminar I meets weekly in the Spring Quarter of the third year, but only every otherweek during the autumn and winter terms of the fourth year. Throughout the period of researching and writingthe thesis, students benefit from the company of their peers and the guidance of their preceptor, who is anadvanced history graduate student, serves as the seminar instructor, and is the second reader of the thesis. Youmust receive a B grade in BA Seminar I to continue in the research track and enroll in BA Seminar II.BA ThesisThe deadline for submission of the BA thesis is the second Friday of Spring Quarter. Students who wishto complete their papers in a quarter other than Spring Quarter must petition the department through theassociate director. Students graduating in a quarter other than Spring Quarter must turn in their theses by Fridayof seventh week of their final quarter. When circumstances justify it, the department establishes individualdeadlines and procedures.With approval from the undergraduate faculty chairs in two departments, history students may be able towrite a BA thesis that meets requirements for a dual major. Students must consult with both chairs before the endof Spring Quarter of their third year. A consent form, to be signed by both chairs, is available from the Collegeadviser. It must be completed and returned to the College adviser by the end of Autumn Quarter of the student'syear of graduation.Students are eligible to apply for research funding for summer research from the Department of Historyand the PRISM (Planning Resources and Involvement for Students in the Majors) program. Students are alsoencouraged to take advantage of funding that is available for language study abroad through the ForeignLanguage Acquisition Grant (FLAG) program. For details on available funding, students should consult theassociate director.HonorsStudents pursuing the Research Track who have done exceptionally well in their course work and havewritten an outstanding BA thesis are recommended for honors. Candidates must have an overall GPA of 3.0 orhigher and a GPA of 3.7 or higher in the twelve courses counting towards the major. Readers submit BA thesesfor departmental honors that they judge to be of particular distinction. If the department concurs, the studentis awarded honors. Students who fail to meet the deadline for submission of the BA thesis are not eligible forhonors consideration.2018-2019 The College            439Summary of Requirements for the MajorRegular TrackSix courses in a major field600Six electives600One of the 12 courses above must be a Research Colloquium (1BA Thesis Seminar I1002BA Thesis Seminar II100Total Units1200§Students on the Research Track should complete their Research Colloquium before Spring Quarter of theirthird year.Reading and Research CoursesStudents interested in pursuing a program of study that cannot be met by means of regular courses havethe option of devising a reading and research course (1 BA Thesis Seminar I, and 2 BA Thesis Seminar II must be takenfor quality grades. In exceptional circumstances, students who are majoring in history may petition to allowa course taken for a pass/fail grade to count towards the requirements of the major. Students wishing to do soshould consult with the associate director. A pass grade is to be given only for work of C– quality or higher.Students should also consult with their College adviser about the appropriateness of pass/fail grading options intheir larger program of study.Minor in HistoryStudents specializing in all disciplines are welcome to minor in history. Majors in such fields as internationalstudies, political science, public policy, economics, and philosophy find that a history minor complements theirmajor by providing a historical understanding of social, cultural, political, and economic issues, while thosemajoring in such disciplines as mathematics and the sciences use the minor to explore a different area of interestand to develop their humanistic understanding of the world. Students may choose to take courses in a variety of440         Historyfields, time periods, and thematic topics, with the aim of developing a broad understanding of historical changeacross time and space, or they may choose to focus specifically on a more narrowly defined field of interest.Students wishing to pursue the minor should contact the associate director and complete the minordeclaration form no later than the end of the third year. The associate director's approval for the minor programshould be submitted to a student's College adviser by the deadline above on a form obtained from the adviser.RequirementsThe history minor requires a total of six courses chosen in consultation with the associate director. Coursesin the minor (1) may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors; (2) may not becounted toward general education requirements; (3) may not be petitioned in from other departments; (4) mustbe taken for quality grades; and (5) must consist of more than half of the courses bearing University of Chicagocourse numbers.Course NumberingHistory courses numbered 10000 to 29999 are intended primarily for College students; 10000-level coursesare introductory. Some 20000-level courses have 30000-level equivalents when they are open to graduatestudents. To register for 20000/30000 cross-listed courses, undergraduates must use the undergraduate number(20000). History courses numbered 40000 to 49999 are intended primarily for graduate students, but are open toadvanced College students with the consent of the instructor. Undergraduates registered for 40000-level coursesare held to the graduate-level requirements.Double MajorStudents planning to double major in history and another discipline are encouraged to do so, with thefollowing stipulations:•Double counting: Courses that are cross-listed with another department may be used for both majors.•BA thesis and seminar: Double majors pursuing the Research Track must fulfill the requirementspertaining to the BA thesis, including taking part in the BA seminar.Study AbroadThe Department of History strongly supports study abroad. We have arranged the course work requirementto make that possible, but a little prior planning is required, especially for those pursuing the Research Track. Ifat all possible, it is best to study abroad during Autumn and/or Winter Quarters of the third year. However, if afull-year study abroad experience is desired, that is still compatible with the Research Track history major. Onesection of the BA seminar (combining requirements of BA Seminar I and II in an accelerated manner) meets inAutumn Quarter to accommodate fourth-year students who have been abroad third year; these students registerfor BA Seminar II with the rest of their third-year cohort. All Research Track history majors are required to be oncampus for Autumn and Winter Quarters of their fourth year in order to complete the BA thesis.History Courses1-29802.

Students in the program must do sufficient work in one or more sciences to acquirea sound foundation for studying the nature of science. After securing this basis, they are expected to gainan understanding of how science arose, as well as how the content of scientific thought has changed and ischanging, because of both its own internal dynamic and its interaction with the larger society in which it isembedded.The HIPS program is designed to make possible the study of a wide range of social, historical, andconceptual issues relating to science. Students completing the program follow a number of different careers.Some pursue graduate study in the history and philosophy of science or in some field of science. Others find theprogram valuable preparation for the study of medicine, law, public policy, or science journalism. More generally,the goal of the program is to provide students with a sound basis on which to interpret and evaluate scienceand science policy. Some students choose to construct a degree program combining the requirements for theHIPS major with those for a major in the physical or biological sciences. Others, having met the HIPS programrequirements, use electives to broaden their liberal arts education.Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in HIPS. Information follows the description ofthe major.HIPS SponsorThe Morris Fishbein Center for the History of Science and Medicine sponsors the HIPS program.

Note:Enrollment in 0 is open only to students who are doing independent study that is not related to theresearch or writing of the BA thesis. As a general rule, only one reading and research course can be countedtowards the history major.Petitioning for Outside CreditThe Department of History offers a wide variety of courses each quarter, and majors are stronglyencouraged to take history courses to fulfill the requirements of the major. In some instances, courses thatoriginate outside the department can be used to fulfill the course requirements of the major. To receive historycredit for nondepartmental courses, you must petition the Undergraduate Studies Committee for approval. Afew things to keep in mind:•Petitions must include a course description, a syllabus, and a statement of purpose that addresses thevalue of the course for your proposed course of study.•Allow sufficient time for committee review and to enable you to take one or more additional historycourse(s) should your petition be denied.•You should give your petition to the associate director, who shares it with the chair of theUndergraduate Studies Committee.•Courses taken abroad may also be used towards the major, pending approval of the petition, howevermore than half of the requirements for the major must be met by registering for courses bearing Universityof Chicago course numbers.•Petitions for courses abroad must include course syllabi, descriptions, and course work.•Generally, no more than two petitions per student will be approved.•Documentation of approved petitions must be provided to the College adviser in a timely fashion forprocessing.GradingCourses counting towards the history major are normally taken for quality grades.

The twentieth century issometimes called the "golden age" of medicine: a period in which medicine broke free of tradition and combinedwith science to provide powerful new ways of understanding disease, and spectacular new technologies forfighting sickness. Along with amelioration of suffering, however, came new diseases, new medical systems, andnew ways of thinking about the relationship between medical bodies, political bodies, and the nature and scopeof human misery. This course examines some of the many transformations of (predominantly Euro-American)medicine in the twentieth century, looking not only at advances in medical knowledge and technologies, but alsoat the social, political, moral and affective ramifications of new ways of thinking about the promise - and perils -of (bio)medical practice.Instructor(s): Michael Paul Rossi Terms Offered: SpringEquivalent Course(s): 4.

HIST 1810,"1. Democracy in America? 100 Units.This course will explore the unlikely career of democracy in US history. Throughout its past, the United Stateshas been defined by endless and unpredictable struggles to establish and extend self-government of one kind oranother--even as those struggles have encountered great resistance and relied on the exclusion or subordinationof some portion of society to underwrite expanding freedom and equality for those enjoying the fullest benefitsof citizenship. American democracy has also relied on a conceptual separation between state and society that hasnecessarily broken down in practice, as political institutions produced and sustained economic forms like slaveryor the corporation, social arrangements like the family, and cultural values such as freedom--even as privateinterests worked their reciprocal influence over public institutions. Over the course of the quarter we will explorethis contested history of democracy in America through a close reading of classic texts (including Tocqueville'sfamous study), contextualized by the most current historical scholarship. Small, incremental writing assignmentsand individual presentations will culminate in a final essay that can emphasize philosophical/theoretical orhistorical/empirical questions according to students' interests. Students will also have the option of conductingtheir own original research to satisfy some portion of the course work, which may lead to subsequent internshipopportunities with relevant faculty.Instructor(s): J.

HIST 2021,"0. History Lab: Migration and Mobility in Human History. 100 Units.This Making History course will explore different episodes of human mobility. We will study forced andvoluntary migrations by considering the earliest movements of people out of Africa, the transatlantic slave trade,the displacements in Europe produced by World War II, and the current flows of people from Africa and theMiddle East across the Mediterranean. These wide-ranging topics necessarily demand that students use a varietyof primary sources and methodologies; assigned readings will thus be supplemented by documentaries, audiorecordings, artistic renditions, and material culture. For their final project students will be required to workindividually or in teams to investigate an example of human migration. Student may present the results of thisresearch as a formal academic essay, may create a website or video, or use some other medium.Instructor(s): E.

HIST 2190,"3. Medieval Christian Mythology. 100 Units.Heaven and hell, angels and demons, the Virgin Mary and the devil battling over the state of human souls,the world on the edge of apocalypse awaiting the coming of the Judge and the resurrection of the dead, thetransubstantiation of bread and wine into body and blood, the great adventures of the saints. As RudolfBultmann put it in his summary of the "world picture" of the New Testament, "all of this is mythological talk,"arguably unnecessary for Christian theology. And yet, without its mythology, much of Christianity becomesincomprehensible as a religious or symbolic system. This course is intended as an introduction to the stories thatmedieval Christians told about God, his Mother, the angels, and the saints, along with the place of the sacramentsand miracles in the world picture of the medieval church. Sources will range from Hugh of St. Victor's summa onthe sacraments to Hildegard of Bingen's visionary "Scivias," the Pseudo-Bonaventuran "Meditations on the Life ofChrist," and Jacobus de Voragine's "Golden Legend," along with handbooks on summoning angels and cycles ofmystery plays.Instructor(s): R.

HIST 2210,"2. Medieval Travelers. 100 Units.Why did Europeans respond as they did to the opportunities opened to them with Columbus's discovery of a"new world" in the late fifteenth century? What precedents and preconceptions did they have for their encounterwith this "new world"? This course seeks to answer these questions by looking to the accounts of those whotraveled both within and beyond Europe, in fact and in imagination, during the centuries preceding Columbus'svoyage. Its argument will be that to understand what Columbus and his contemporaries found when theyarrived in the "new world," we must first understand what they thought they were looking for--and that whatthey were looking for is not necessarily what we might expect. The course gives students the opportunity towrite a significant research paper, written in the character of a medieval traveler, whether a merchant, pilgrim,crusader, missionary, geographer, or conquistador.Instructor(s): R.

A vast expanse of central Europe that is today dividedamong more than a dozen nations was ruled, at least in theory, by the emperors during the central and lateMiddle Ages. The purpose of this course is to trace some of the major developments in imperial historybetween 800 (Charlemagne's coronation as emperor) and the early sixteenth century. Topics will include thechanging nature of imperial authority from the Carolingians to the Habsburgs, the Church's and the nobility'sestablishment of quasi-independent lordships inside imperial territory, papal-imperial relations, and theeastward expansion of the empire.Instructor(s): J.

Censorship, Info Control, & Revolutions in Info Technology from the Printing Press to theInternet. 100 Units.The digital revolution is triggering a wave of new information control efforts and censorship attempts, rangingfrom monopolistic copyright laws to the "Great Firewall" of China. The print revolution after 1450 was amoment like our own, when the explosive dissemination of a new information technology triggered a wave ofinformation control efforts. Many of today's attempts at information control closely parallel early responses tothe printing press, so the premodern case gives us centuries of data showing how diverse attempts to controlor censors information variously incentivized, discouraged, curated, silenced, commodified, or nurtured art,thought, and science. This unique course is part of a collaborative research project funded by the NeubauerCollegium for Culture and Society and is co-organized with digital information expert Cory Doctorow.

The United States and Latin America, a History from 1840s to Trump. 100 Units.Over the second half of the twentieth century, it became a cliché that the United States was an empire and that theso-called Latin America was its backyard, the region where the empire paraded, with largesse, its mighty will.And yet, on one hand, over the last 150 years both the United States and "Latin America" have had variegatedforms of interactions, which cannot be easily characterized as one single historical constant; on the other, intoday's world the question seems unavoidable: is "Latin America" still a homogenous unique region with whichthe United States interacts collectively in the same ways whether in political, economic, or military terms?Making use of historical analysis in tandem with constant discussions of current events in the United States and"Latin America," the course seeks to invite students to add a disciplined historical imagination to the historian/political scientist/analyst toolbox.

We will examine the history of this relationship and the living legacyof that history in the narratives of everyday people. Are recent frameworks theorizing a global hegemonicsystem of "slavery and racial capitalism" really our ultimate horizon? Are there any redemptive possibilitiesin older renderings committed to a more distinctive and disaggregated parsing of slavery and capitalism?Critical to approaching these questions are how people of African descent have themselves remembered slavery,experienced capitalism, and marshalled those memories in the service of emancipatory political movements.As such this course will focus on primary documents that give voice to enslaved peoples as well as secondaryliterature written by black historians attempting to shape international thought on this question. The ultimateaim is a wider understanding of the rise of Western modernity and how peoples of the African diasporanavigated and, at times, contested its consequences.Instructor(s): G.

A Transnational History of Reparative Justice. 100 Units.In light of recent revelations tying the University of Chicago to slavery, this course will explore the long historyof reparations as a global, national, and local set of questions. How does a given polity go about repairing theun-repairable and forgiving the unforgivable? Are the discursive norms of reparations irredeemably bound toour current conceptualizations of politics, governance, private-property rights, individualism, and the law orcan reparations, and how we talk about them, serve as a means of reimagining these categories? How mightthe practice and performance of reparations actually be structured to foster both intra-group and inter-groupunity while avoiding a potentially divisive backlash? Beginning with ancient forms of restorative justice andproceeding briskly into more recent attempts at truth and reconciliation, this course aims to take a transnationaland comparative approach to exploring the history of reparations from an interdisciplinary perspective. Theultimate aim is a greater understanding of the possibilities of reparations as they relate to slavery, Jim Crow, andpost-1968 discrimination against people of African descent in the United States, which constitutes the second halfof this course.Instructor(s): G.

History Colloquium: Religion and History. 100 Units.The study of religion presents an enormous challenge to the historian. On the one hand, religious beliefstypically posit a reality beyond that accessible to the tools of analysis employed by most historians; on theother, such beliefs and their associated practices have given shape and purpose to human society and psychesthroughout human history, making them one of the most important drivers of human thought and behavior. Inthis colloquium, we will wrestle with the question of how, as historians, it is possible to make sense of the roleof religion in history. We will explore different methodologies for thinking about religion and test them withspecific examples of belief and practice across various religious traditions. To ensure a variety of perspectives,students will be able to choose the tradition they want to focus on for their class presentations and final projects.Instructor(s): R.

Duringthe twentieth century, sociologists, historians, philosophers, and anthropologists raised original, interesting, andconsequential questions about the sciences. Often their work drew on and responded to each other, and, takentogether, their various approaches came to constitute a field, "science studies." The course furnishes an initialguide to this field. Students will not only encounter some of its principal concepts, approaches and findings,but will also get a chance to apply science-studies perspectives themselves by performing a fieldwork project.Among the topics we may examine are: the sociology of scientific knowledge and its applications; actor-networktheories of science; constructivism and the history of science; and efforts to apply science studies approachesbeyond the sciences themselves.Equivalent Course(s): "

But although we tend to thinkof it as something distinctively modern, in fact it came into being through a long history of thought, practice,and technology. This course will therefore suggest how to think historically about information. Using examplesthat range from the Middle Ages to the twenty-first century, we shall explore how different societies haveconceptualized the subject and how they have sought to control it. We shall address how information has beencollected, classified, circulated, contested, and destroyed. The aim is to provide a different kind of understandingof information practices--one that can be put to use in other historical inquiries, as well as casting an unfamiliarlight on our own everyday lives.Instructor(s): A.

We will first look at proof-theoretic effortstowards demonstrating the consistency of various foundational systems, discussing the virtues and limitationsof this approach. We will then closely examine Godel's theorems, which are famous for demonstrating limits onthe extent to which we can formulate consistency proofs.

Historians have oftenrelegated Iberia and its New World domains from accounts of the developments of modern science. They havetraditionally claimed that strict censorship and a commitment to orthodox Catholicism prevented Spain, once themost powerful empire of the world, from embarking on the path towards scientific modernity in the eighteenthcentury. Modern scholars, however, have challenged this narrative by embracing more inclusive concepts of"science" to explain the many ways in which early modern people related to nature. Some of these practicesinclude the writing of natural histories, botanical research, and linguistic studies, all fields that Iberian scholarspioneered in their efforts to govern their vast domains. This course will introduce students to a diversity ofscientific practices that flourished in the Hispanic world between 1400 and 1800.Equivalent Course(s): "

We find throughout history, in the writings of Galileo, Jorge Luis Borges, IbnKhaldun, Herodotus, and the Hebrew Bible, a city of Babylon full of contradictions. At once sinful andreverential, a site of magic and science, rational and irrational, Babylon seemed destined to resound in thehistorical imagination as the birthplace of knowledge itself. But how does the myth compare to history? Howdid the Babylonians themselves envisage their own knowledge? And is it reasonable to draw, as Keynes did, aline that begins with Babylon and ends with Newton?

Codebreakers,meanwhile, have been battling in parallel to break into those secrets nearly as long. From Roman generals toArabic mathematicians to the Zimmerman telegram, cryptography has long been important to military anddiplomatic history, while technological developments in the last forty years have brought cryptography to themasses, securing bank transactions, text messages, and countless other data on the Internet. This course willsurvey the long history of cryptology from the ancient world to today, with a focus on its uses in society. We willdiscuss, among other things, changing ideas of secrecy, privacy, and freedom of speech; the relationship betweenthe state and science; and how technological developments influence and are influenced by cultural context.

I'm interested in understanding a way of writing about scientiststhat is not readily available to historians of science, a more expressive, more intuited way of writing that wecan find in some poets and novelists: Osip Mandelstam writing of the way "Lamarck wept his eyes out over hismagnifying glass"; Arthur Koestler of how Kepler laid "a monstrous egg" with his elliptical orbit. I am interestedin the particular license taken in these instances-that flash of soul; I think the same license is taken to great effectin, for instance, the historical fiction of Hilary Mantel, and I want to see what we can win by it if we permitourselves to tolerate it in real histories, and particularly in histories of science. That's a larger inquiry than thiscourse undertakes, but I try to begin here by studying some writers who have won by it.Instructor(s): Lily Huang Terms Offered: Spring.

The program is meant to accommodate a course of study thatcould not otherwise be carried out easily within the structures of a single disciplinary major.One of the notable features of the program is the requirement that all ISHU majors complete a formal BApaper at the end of their term of study that integrates the disparate fields of each student's study in a trulyinterdisciplinary manner. A BA paper will normally consist of an analytical research paper. An alternative optionis a creative BA project, which would be accompanied by an analytical write-up of the project's background,conceptual problem(s), and methodology.To be considered for admission to this BA program, a student must submit an application. This applicationconsists of the student's selection and rationalization of a plan of courses that form a discrete field ofinterdisciplinary study. (The specific materials and protocol necessary for the application are described below.)The application process is designed to make clear in each individual case what intellectual concerns are to berelated to one another through interdisciplinary study and what method of comparative analysis is suited to suchan approach.Students should discuss plans and proposed courses with both the ISHU chair and College adviser.These meetings will help students evaluate the available courses of study to arrive at a balanced and coherentinterdisciplinary plan.Once a student is admitted to ISHU, she or he will come to have the support also of the BA preceptorand, by the end of the third year, a faculty BA adviser. The preceptor is typically a graduate student withinterdisciplinary expertise who will help the student to progress towards successful completion of the degreeprogram, including completion of the BA paper. The faculty adviser is a faculty member who has expertise in thestudent's main field of study, and agrees to supervise the development of the BA paper specifically. (The studentis responsible for securing a faculty BA adviser, but can ask the ISHU staff for assistance in doing so.)A student in the ISHU BA program will take courses in two or three academic departments, and it iscommon for ISHU majors to have two or three sets of chosen courses that do not intersect with each other at all.(Your program is interdisciplinary; your courses, individually, need not be interdisciplinary.) There is, however, arequired structure to the distribution of courses that a student takes, and there are two specific courses that everyISHU major must take. These requirements are explained below.Program RequirementsEach student's program of study must meet the following six distribution requirements. Students can ensurethat these requirements are met by completing the application worksheet that is available from the ISHU Collegeadviser or ishum.uchicago.edu:1.Six courses in a primary field or in closely integrated subject areas in more than one field.2.Three courses in a first supporting field or in closely integrated subject areas in more than one field.3.Three courses in a second supporting field or in closely integrated subject areas in more than one field.A "field" is defined in one of three ways: (a) a selection of courses from a traditional department (such asNear Eastern Languages and Civilizations or Philosophy), (b) a traditional discipline spread over more thanone department (such as a "Theater" field containing South Asian Languages and Civilizations and Theaterand Performance Studies courses), or (c) an interdisciplinary set of courses under a certain rubric (suchas an "American studies" field containing courses from English, History, and Sociology, or a "Narrative/Storytelling" field containing courses from Romance or Slavic Languages and Literatures, Anthropology, andPsychology). Students are encouraged to create their six-course field from a single, traditional discipline, sothat, however broad their program, they can also have some depth of learning in a single discipline.Any one of the fields listed under (1), (2), and (3) may be drawn from outside the humanities.4.Two courses or one sequence of two courses (drawn from offerings in the humanities) that emphasizesintellectual approaches or critical methods germane to a student's particular interdisciplinary courseprogram.5.0, 0.

ISHU 2980,"2 The BA Colloquium in the Spring Quarter of the third year, which meets three times overthe quarter and is taught by the ISHU BA preceptor. The purpose of this course is for each student to beginworking on the structure and argument of the BA paper that he or she will complete the following year. Atthe end of the course, each student will have written a proposal for the BA paper, which will generally be a486         Interdisciplinary Studies in the Humanitiesprécis of the argument that the student anticipates making. Grading for this course is Pass/Fail (P/F) for allstudents.Students should note that the course carries no numerical credit towards their degree (it is a "zero-unit"course). It cannot fill any role in the student's degree program other than the one it is designed to fill; it alsocannot be an elective. Because it is a noncredit course, students must carry at least three additional courseswhile registered for 2 in order to meet requirements for full-time student status. Regardlessof these technical qualifications, the course is compulsory for ISHU majors in their third year unless anexemption is granted for unusual circumstances, such as the student's being in residence at a study-abroadprogram that quarter.6.2The BA Colloquium0002 The BA Colloquium, for which students will receive a grade ofPass or Fail.HonorsTo be eligible for honors, a student must maintain an overall GPA of 3.25 or higher and a GPA in the majorof 3.5 or higher. Honors are reserved for the student whose BA project shows exceptional intellectual merit in thejudgment of the faculty adviser, ISHU chair, and master of the Humanities Collegiate Division.AdvisingClose contact with the faculty and staff relevant to the student's career in ISHU—including the ISHU Collegeadviser, chair, and preceptor, and the faculty adviser of the BA paper—is essential in a program that involvesso much individual initiative and experimentation. Students are encouraged to seek their advice whenever theyhave an intellectual or practical concern about progress in the major.FacultySince ISHU is an interdisciplinary major whose field of study encompasses all the offerings in the variousdepartments and programs of the University (particularly in the Humanities Division), all faculty members ofthese varied departments and programs are related to ISHU. ISHU students may approach any University ofChicago faculty member who works in his or her field of interest with a request to serve as faculty adviser forthe BA paper. Similarly, ISHU students may take courses with any faculty member from any department of theUniversity.CoursesFor the same reason—that ISHU is an interdisciplinary major whose field of study encompasses all theofferings in the various departments and programs of the University (particularly in the Humanities Division)—all substantive and methodology courses offered in these varied departments and programs are viable coursesfor the program. ISHU students may take any courses offered in the University that fit in with their program ofstudy, provided these are approved by the ISHU College adviser and chair.488         Interdisciplinary Studies in the HumanitiesIn addition to the above courses that are grounded in particular fields of study, the program requires allISHU students to take two courses that are related to the preparation of the BA paper:2.

In these meetings they will discuss their work with the preceptor andshow him or her drafts of the BA paper or, in the minimal case, evidence of their progress toward the completionof the paper. By the end of the Autumn Quarter, fourth-year students will turn in a preliminary draft/firstiteration of the BA paper to the preceptor. There will then be a pre-final draft due to the faculty BA adviser, theISHU chair, and the preceptor for perusal and critique by the end of the Winter Quarter. The final BA papershould be turned in to each of these three people and also to the academic advisor by Friday of fourth week inSpring Quarter.In addition to these departmental requirements, a student's faculty BA adviser may impose earlier deadlinesand further conditions in relation to the work expected of the student in 0 Preparation of the BAProject.Sample ProgramsWhile the potential for developing individual BA programs in Interdisciplinary Studies is as great as thecombined ingenuity, imagination, and interest of each student in consultation with his or her advisers, thereare identifiable patterns in the choices of fields and lines of inquiry currently being implemented in the ISHUprogram. The most prominent of these include the following:1.Study in philosophy and literature (with either literature or philosophy emphasized) to investigatedifferences in handling concepts and language in philosophy and literature and/or mutual influencebetween the two fields.2.Study in verbal and nonverbal art forms and expressions (art and literature; and music and literature)leading to consideration of the implications of the verbal and nonverbal distinction for interpretation andcriticism.3.Study in the history, philosophy, language, religious expression, and literary and artistic productionsof a given culture or of a given historical period within one or more cultures. Examples include Americanstudies, the Renaissance, the Near East, or Greece (and the Mediterranean) in the preclassical and classicalages.4.Study in humanistic fields (e.g., literature and philosophy) and in a social science field (e.g., sociology,psychology, anthropology, political science). This option is particularly adapted to a focus on gender studies.Please note, however, that the College offers a major in Gender Studies.5.Study of modern culture in its various aspects of popular and elite forms of cultural expression.2018-2019 The College            4876.Study in humanistic approaches to biological or physical science. This option is particularly adapted tointerest in problems or aspects of intellectual and cultural history (e.g., the impact of Newtonian physics oneighteenth-century European thought) or to study of modern society and science's role within it (medicalethics being one possible focus among many).7.Study in human rights in relation to one or two humanistic disciplines such as philosophy, literature, orhistory.ApplicationInterested students should make application to the ISHU program as soon as possible upon completionof general education requirements (typically by the end of the second year and, except in extraordinarycircumstances, no later than the end of Autumn Quarter of the third year). Transfer students in particular areurged to apply at the earliest point that they can. An application is initiated by securing an interview withthe ISHU chair and College adviser, to discuss the feasibility of shaping and implementing a given set ofinterdisciplinary concerns into a course of study for the BA.After consultation, students who wish to pursue an application to the ISHU program must submit a recentcourse transcript (with a minimum B average in preceding course work) and a two-part written proposalaccording to the following guidelines:Personal StatementThe first part of the proposal consists of a personal reflective statement of approximately 500 to 1,000 wordsin length, explaining the character of their interdisciplinary interests and stating as thoughtfully as possible howthey propose to channel and expand them within course offerings currently available. Some consideration ofprospects and possibilities for a BA paper or project is a desirable part of these statements, if it can be provided.Course ProspectusThe second part of the proposal consists of a list of courses to fill the headings given in the above set ofguidelines. This list will include courses the student has already taken as well as ones he or she intends to take.While a list of courses the student proposes to take is a required part of the application, it is understood thatthese will undergo modification. Any changes to the course prospectus should be discussed with (and approvedby) the College adviser.After the application materials have been reviewed by the ISHU chair and academic adviser, a twenty-minute interview will be scheduled with the ISHU chair. The ISHU chair will inform the student via email of theresult of the application.GradingAll courses in the major must be taken for a quality grade (that is, A, B, C, D, or F, with + and – grades), withthe exception of the zero-unit course 0.

Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units.The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious,political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of textscontinues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course,we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualizetheir ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt.Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient NearEast.

Introduction to the Hebrew Bible. 100 Units.The Hebrew Bible (Old Testament) is a complex anthology of disparate texts and reflects a diversity of religious,political, and historical perspectives from ancient Israel, Judah, and Yehud. Because this collection of textscontinues to play an important role in modern religions, new meanings are often imposed upon it. In this course,we will attempt to read biblical texts apart from modern preconceptions about them. We will also contextualizetheir ideas and goals through comparison with texts from ancient Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine, and Egypt.Such comparisons will demonstrate that the Hebrew Bible is fully part of the cultural milieu of the Ancient NearEast. To accomplish these goals, we will read a significant portion of the Hebrew Bible in English, along withrepresentative selections from secondary literature.

LLSO 2420,"0Legal Reasoning, a study, based primarily on cases, of the classic conventions of legal argument in the Anglo-American legal system. In other years, the Introductory Course might be Roman Law or Greek Law, MedievalLaw, or a text-based course on ancient legal philosophy, or a comparison of modern legal categories and policieswith those of former societies and cultures. The objective is not so much to establish a historical foundation formodern studies as to demonstrate that legal systems are culturally rooted; that urgent, present concerns mayobscure important characteristics of legal ideas and behavior; and that many recurrent themes in Western legalthought are shaped or driven by both common and uncommon features. Unlike many legal studies programsthat attempt to orient study of the law primarily in contemporary debates, usually in the field of Americanconstitutional law, the program seeks to organize its exploration of law as a system rather than as a forum or aninstrument.Other Course WorkStudents must also take two courses each in the Letters and Society divisions of the program, plus sixother courses complementary to the required work, as outlined previously (the other six courses may be onescross listed in the program or may be from other disciplines). Letters and Society are not meant as fixed or self-defining fields, but instead as organizational categories emphasizing two fundamental modes of examininglaw in a systemic fashion. Courses under the rubric of Letters (whether based in the program or in English,philosophy, or political theory) tend to be based on the study of literary and historical artifacts, such as cases,tracts, conventional literature, or other texts, and emphasize the ways in which law formally constitutes itself.Questions of interpretative and normative theory, rhetorical strategy, and the like are central to such courses.Society serves to organize studies from a variety of different disciplines (including history, political science,economics, and sociology) that try to measure, with different techniques and at different times, the effect of2018-2019 The College            505law on society. The combined objective is to treat law as an intellectual activity and as a phenomenon, and toemphasize that both occur in contexts that help to shape them, whether ancient or modern.ResearchIn addition to satisfying the course requirements, each student in the program must produce evidence ofsustained research in the form of a substantial research paper during either the junior or senior year and obtainapproval of a member of the faculty, although not necessarily a member of the program faculty. Papers maybe written in conjunction with Law, Letters, and Society courses, under the auspices of reading and researchcourses, or in a Research Seminar. (The paper is an independent requirement, however, and need not beaccomplished in conjunction with enrollment in a specific course.) The scope, method, and objective of the paper,as well as its length, are subject to negotiation between the student and the instructor.Summary of Requirements0Legal Reasoning (Introductory Course)100Two Letters courses (List II)200Two Society courses (List III)200Six Complementary courses *600Total Units1100*Complementary courses are courses from other departments that support work done in the major. Somestudents prefer to concentrate their work on a specific issue or problem, e.g., urban politics and policy,historic societal discrimination, or the role of international institutions in policy implementation. Otherstudents prefer to examine a series of discrete topics that are not directly related but that concern theoperation of regimes of social control. Lists of Pre-Approved Complementary Courses are publishedquarterly, and students who believe that a course not so listed nonetheless supports work in the majormay petition the program chair for approval at any time while enrolled in the course or within one quarterof completing the course. Courses taken in Autumn Quarter of the second year simultaneously with theIntroductory Course may count as Complementary Courses.HonorsStudents who wish to be considered for honors must notify the program chairman and their facultysupervisor in writing no later than two quarters before the quarter in which they expect to receive their degree.Eligible students must maintain a GPA of at least 3.50 both overall and in the major, and they must write adistinguished research paper. The paper must be submitted by noon on Friday of fifth week in the quarter ofproposed graduation (other papers must be submitted by noon on Friday of seventh week), and the student'sfaculty supervisor and a second reader must agree that honors are merited. It should be noted that honors areawarded sparingly.Reading and Research CoursesFor students with a legitimate interest in pursuing study that cannot be met by means of regular courses,there is an option of devising a reading and research course to be supervised by a member of the faculty andtaken for a quality grade. Such courses may not be used to satisfy the requirements of either the two-courseLetters or two-course Society requirements, but may be used to satisfy part of the other six required courses, withthe written permission of the program chairman obtained in advance of initiation of the work. Only two researchcourses may be used within the major. 0 Legal Reasoningin Autumn Quarter of their second year. This requirement is not negotiable. Students should note that, as aninterdisciplinary major, the program has a strictly limited enrollment and that registration for the IntroductoryCourse is determined during the preceding Spring Quarter.

Introduction to Semantics and Pragmatics. 100 Units.This course familiarizes students with what it means to study meaning and use in natural language. By"meaning" we refer to the (for the most part, logical) content of words, constituents, and sentences (semantics),and by "use" we intend to capture how this content is implemented in discourse and what kinds of additionaldimensions of meaning may then arise (pragmatics). Some of the core empirical phenomena that have todo with meaning are introduced: lexical (i.e., word) meaning, reference, quantification, logical inferencing,presupposition, implicature, context sensitivity, cross-linguistic variation, speech acts. Main course goals are notonly to familiarize students with the basic topics in semantics and pragmatics but also to help them develop basicskills in semantic analysis and argumentation.Instructor(s): Itamar Francez Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): "

In what ways does spoken language differ from signed language? What features make spokenand signed language linguistic? What features distinguish linguistic means of communication from animalcommunication? How do humans communicate with animals? From an evolutionary point of view, howcan we account for the fact that spoken language is the dominant mode of communication in all humancommunities around the world? Why cannot animals really communicate linguistically? What do the termslanguage "acquisition" and "transmission" really mean?

Language and Violence. 100 Units.Language is generally associated with the abstract realm of thought, representation and expression, a realm thatcontrasts sharply with the material realm in which we tend to place violence. Language is furthermore oftenseen as antithetical to violence: violence is outburst that comes when the rational order of language fails. In fact,however, questions of language, and especially of speech, surface in every aspect of thinking about violence.Speech is a medium within which violence is performed, and is part of the modern machinery of war. It is alsoa medium through which systems of oppression and subordination are articulated and registered by groupsand individuals, socially and psychically. Violence relies on speech for its justification, rationalization, andsustention. At the same time, the rawness of violence challenges our fundamental faith in the representationaland expressive capacities of language, in both destructive and creative ways. This intensive reading seminarexplores the relation between speech and violence through scholarly and literary texts from a variety ofhumanistic fields and traditions.Instructor(s): Itamar Francez Terms Offered: Spring"

LING 2602,"0. Truth. 100 Units.One of the salient features of our culture is that there is so much bullshit," says the Princeton philosopher HarryFrankfurt in his 1986 essay, 'On Bullshit.' Frankfurt distinguishes bullshit from lying, and argues that it is themore insidious of the two because it involves not an attempt to conceal the truth, but rather a failure to even careabout the truth in the first place. But what exactly is truth, and why should we care so much about it? This coursewill begin with an examination of the fundamental role of a truth convention in meaning and communication,the way that such a convention makes bullshit possible, and the causes and consequences of bullshit. We willthen turn to foundational questions about the nature of truth, criticisms of the value of truth and why they havehad such appeal, and expressions of skepticism about the possibility of "objective" truth. Along the way, we willconsider whether it makes sense for everyone to agree that something is the case and yet still be wrong; whetherour claims to know certain things are always limited because they come from a particular perspective; paradoxesof truth and falsity and their relevance for scientific inquiry; and what value (if any) truth contributes to the well-lived life.Instructor(s): Chris Kennedy Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): "

Design, as a field, now encompasses a wide range of human interactions with the technologies,devices, environments, and communities that shape daily life. The largest company in the world (by marketcapitalization) is fundamentally a design company. Apple Inc.’s products inspire feelings of love and devotion (aswell as frustration) with few rivals in any cultural sphere. Design is central to the company’s identity and success.A former Apple engineer observed that when a designer joined a meeting it was “like being in church when thepriest walks in.”Our current historical period, described by some as the “digital revolution” or a “postindustrial society,”relies heavily on media and design, which embed technologies increasingly within everyday life. If you considerthe number of screens in your immediate vicinity, it becomes evident how substantial an impact media artsand design have on the ways we learn, work, and play. The design of screens (in their aesthetic, interactive, andtechnical dimensions) affects how we think, act, and communicate. Extraordinarily rapid developments havechanged the character of contemporary life—in ways that remain largely opaque and demand ongoing study,critique, and experimentation. The University of Chicago is now in a position to establish new practice-basedresearch that combines analytical and creative approaches to understanding these problems and to solving them.Minor in Media Arts and DesignDistribution RequirementThe minor is comprised of six courses. Of those six courses, students must take at least one course in each ofthe following core areas: (1) Media Theory, (2) Media History, and (3) Media Practice and Design.Courses that qualify for each distribution requirement are listed below.

This course will explore the conceptsof the marvelous, the imaginary, and the real through a selection of French literature from the Middle Ages tothe 17th century. The Middle Ages are often perceived as a rigid feudal society. Yet, fairies abound in stories,people shape-shift, and objects magically transform under our eyes. In the 16th century truth appears to hardenthrough advances in science, mathematics, and art. But simultaneously religious schisms, the discovery of theNew World, and political anarchy shake the notion of the world's stable limits to the core. The 17th century isknown for Descartes' rationalism and classical regularity. But even here there is the unexpected, the surprising jene sais quoi and overwhelming ineffable. Through the literature of each era, we will see how reality often mixeswith the marvelous and everything is not always as it seems.Instructor(s): E. Van Dyke Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): 9. The Medieval Mediterranean. 100 Units.In this course we will be looking at the medieval Mediterranean world from the perspective of French literatureof the 12th and 13th centuries. In direct contrast to an understanding of the Middle Ages as a time of culturalisolation and homogeneity, we will be considering some of the many points of contact between medieval Franceand other Mediterranean geographies, cultures, and peoples. Our readings will take us to such places as Greeceand Rome, Constantinople, Cairo, Syria, Jerusalem, and Spain. The emphasis will be on texts that present thesetrans-Mediterranean relationships in complex and varied ways. Texts will be selected from a variety of genres,including poetry, epic, and romance, and we will also look at medieval art and art objects.Instructor(s): J.

Marsilio Ficino's "On Love" 100 Units.This course is first of all a close reading of Marsilio Ficino's seminal book On Love (first Latin edition Deamore 1484; Ficino's own Italian translation 1544). Ficino's philosophical masterpiece is the foundation of theRenaissance view of love from a Neo-Platonic perspective. It is impossible to overemphasize its influence onEuropean culture. On Love is not just a radically new interpretation of Plato's Symposium. It is the book throughwhich sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe read the love experience. Our course will analyze its multipleclassical sources and its spiritual connotations. During our close reading of Ficino's text, we will show howEuropean writers and philosophers appropriated specific parts of this Renaissance masterpiece. In particular, wewill read extensive excerpts from some important love treatises, such as Castiglione's The Courtier (Il cortigiano),Leone Ebreo's Dialogues on Love, Tullia d'Aragona's On the Infinity of Love, but also selections from a variety ofEuropean poets, such as Michelangelo's canzoniere, Maurice Scève's Délie, and Fray Luis de León's Poesía.Instructor(s): A.

This intensive, 300-unit course covers many of the same principles as MENG29511-29512 Engineering Design I-II, with an eye toward similar outcomes. 1 UndergraduateResearch Colloquium will no longer be offered or required. The Molecular Engineering department recommendsthat majors take 0, unless their AutumnQuarter schedule makes doing so unfeasible. Students with questions should contact the adviser for MolecularEngineering as early as possible.5. Advanced electives (four required courses in the major). The major is structured to allow forconsiderable flexibility for students to tailor their programs along individualized trajectories, with help fromfaculty advisers. Not only can students choose between multiple tracks, but they can further build breadth ordepth through their choice of advanced electives. Moreover, we anticipate that our students will use their generalelectives outside of the major requirements to strengthen their backgrounds in specific areas of interest, also inconsultation with Molecular Engineering advisers, to achieve desired outcomes such as preparation for graduateschool in more traditional engineering disciplines.6. Laboratory skills and hands-on experience. Critical skills that molecular engineers must acquire as partof their educational program include the ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineeringand the ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as the ability to analyze and interpret data.

We also anticipatethat many Molecular Engineering students will receive advanced laboratory experience pursuing undergraduateresearch projects.7. Non-technical skills. Many decades of workshops and panels engaging stakeholders in academia andindustry, often associated with the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), have identifiedcriteria for outcomes of students in engineering education programs. Although there is no plan to seek ABETaccreditation for the Molecular Engineering major, many ABET criteria, particularly those related to non-technological skills, are viewed as essential to incorporate into the Molecular Engineering major. Examples ofstudent outcomes that fall into this category include: (a) an ability to formulate or design a system, process,or program to meet desired needs, (b) an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams, (c) an understandingof professional and ethical responsibility, (d) an ability to communicate effectively, (e) the broad educationnecessary to understand the impact of solutions in a global and societal context, (f) a recognition of the needfor and an ability to engage in life-long learning, and (g) a knowledge of contemporary issues. Many ofthese outcomes will be addressed through both the Molecular Engineering degree curriculum (particularlyemphasized in the Design sequence) and the College general education requirements. Students who are ableto both develop and articulate these skills will be positioned favorably for employment in industry and forpostgraduate study in engineering, medicine, law, and business administration.Entering the ProgramStudents must indicate their intent to pursue the BS program at the end of the Autumn Quarter intheir second year of study by completing the Intent to Pursue Molecular Engineering questionnaire (https://ime.uchicago.edu/students/undergraduates/undergraduate_faq) available on the IME website.

Political scientists use both humanistic and scientific perspectives anda variety of methodological approaches to examine the political dynamics of all countries and regions of theworld, both ancient and modern. Political science contributes to a liberal education by introducing students toconcepts, methods, and knowledge that help them understand and judge politics within and among nations. ABA degree in political science can lead to a career in business, government, journalism, education, or nonprofitorganizations; or it can lead to a PhD program in the social sciences or to professional school in law, business,public policy, or international relations. Our graduates have gone into all those areas in recent years.Program RequirementsStarting in the 2016–17 academic year, the Department of Political Science has abolished the list of "pre-approved" petition courses. No course outside of Political Science taken in Summer 2016 or later will beautomatically counted for the major; all must be petitioned to the department. Inclusion on the now-defunctpre-approved list does not guarantee future approval.Course RequirementsThe Political Science major requires twelve political science courses and a substantial paper. All studentsmust take three out of the four courses that introduce the fields of political science. All students must also takethe required research methods course. Students may meet the writing requirement by completing a BA Thesis orby writing a Long Paper. The BA Thesis and Long Paper options are explained below.Introductory Course RequirementTo gain a broad understanding of political science, the department's faculty thinks students should take awide range of courses. To ensure that breadth, students are required to take at least three of the following fourcourses:"

NEHC 2080,"2. Empires and Peoples: Ethnicity in Late Antiquity. 100 Units.Late antiquity witnessed an unprecedented proliferation of peoples in the Mediterranean and the MiddleEast. Vandals, Arabs, Goths, Huns, Franks, and Iranians, among numerous others, took shape as politicalcommunities within the Roman and Iranian empires or along their peripheries. Recent scholarship has undonethe traditional image of these groups as previously undocumented communities of "barbarians" entering history.Ethnic communities emerge from the literature as political constructions dependent on the very malleabilityof identities, on specific acts of textual and artistic production, on particular religious traditions, and, not least,on the imperial or postimperial regimes sustaining their claims to sovereignty. The colloquium will debate theorigin, nature, and roles of ethno-political identities and communities comparatively across West Asia, fromthe Western Mediterranean to the Eurasian steppes, on the basis of recent contributions. As a historiographicalcolloquium, the course will address the contemporary cultural and political concerns-especially nationalism-thathave often shaped historical accounts of ethnogenesis in the period as well as bio-historical approaches-such asgenetic history-that sometimes sit uneasily with the recent advances of historians.Instructor(s): R.

In order to do so, we introduce humor as bothcultural and transnational. We unpack the multiple layers of cultural meaning in the logic of "Balkan humor." Wealso examine the functions and mechanisms of laughter, both in terms of cultural specificity and general practiceand theories of humor. Thus, the study of Balkan humor will help us elucidate the "Balkan" and the "World," andwill provide insight not only into cultural mores and social relations, but into the very notion of "funny." Ourown laughter in class will be the best measure of our success - both cultural and intellectual.Instructor(s): Angelina Ilieva Terms Offered: SpringPrerequisite(s): Readings in English.

We conclude by considering therole that the imperative to belong to Western Europe played in the Yugoslav wars of succession.

We will explore various "golden ages" Arab nationalists envisioned, like pre-Islamic Semitic empires, the first Islamic state under the leadership of the Prophet Muhammad, the Ummayds,the Abbasids and Muslim Spain, as a way of analyzing the the constructed and temporal nature of nationaldiscourses. We will finally examine the distinction between Pan-Arab nationalism (qawmiyya), which consideredArab culture, history, and language as markers of one's national identity, and often strove for political unitywith other Arab states; and territorial-patriotic nationalism (wataniyya), which hailed the national cultures ofparticular Arab states (Egyptian, Iraqi, Lebanese), focusing on their geography, archaeology, and history the keyfeatures of national identity.Instructor(s): Orit Bashkin Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): "

The Age of Innovation - Famous Firsts 5,000 Years Ago. 100 Units.The first man on moon", "the first Thanksgiving," or "the first kiss"--our society is still fascinated and remembersthe exact moment something happened for the first time. The history of the Ancient Near East, especially theancient civilization of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), is quite rich of such "firsts in history." From the moment,writing is discovered there is an abundance of textual record, covering the first documents about politics, law,and economics. The first private documents allow us a glimpse into what living and dying were like more than5,000 years ago. This course will explore what the cultural conditions of those innovations were, how innovationstransform societies, and why it matters to study ancient civilizations. By discovering primary sources (in Englishtranslation), the fascination of reading those texts for the "first" time will be experienced.

REES 2902,"3, 1. The Shadows of Living Things: The Writings of Mikhail Bulgakov. 100 Units.What would your good do if evil did not exist, and what would the earth look like if all the shadowsdisappeared? After all, shadows are cast by things and people…. Do you want to strip the earth of all the treesand living things just because of your fantasy of enjoying naked light?" asks the Devil. Mikhail Bulgakov workedon his novel The Master and Margarita throughout most of his writing career, in Stalin's Moscow. Bulgakovdestroyed his manuscript, re-created it from memory, and reworked it feverishly even as his body was failinghim in his battle with death. The result is an intense contemplation on the nature of good and evil, on the roleof art and the ethical duty of the artist, but also a dazzling world of magic, witches, and romantic love, and anirresistible seduction into the comedic. Laughter, as shadow and light, as the subversive weapon but also aspower's whip, grounds human relation to both good and evil. Brief excursions to other texts that help us betterunderstand Master and Margarita.Equivalent Course(s): 3. Returning the Gaze: The West and the Rest. 100 Units.Aware of being observed. And judged. Inferior... Abject… Angry... Proud… This course provides insightinto identity dynamics between the "West," as the center of economic power and self-proclaimed normativehumanity, and the "Rest," as the poor, backward, volatile periphery. We investigate the relationship betweenSouth East European self-representations and the imagined Western gaze. Inherent in the act of looking at oneselfthrough the eyes of another is the privileging of that other's standard. We will contemplate the responses tothis existential position of identifying symbolically with a normative site outside of oneself-self-consciousness,defiance, arrogance, self-exoticization-and consider how these responses have been incorporated in the textureof the national, gender, and social identities in the region.

TURK 2012,"3. Summer Intensive Intermediate Turkish. 300 Units.Summer Intensive Intermediate Turkish enables students to develop strong intermediate speaking, listening,reading, and writing skills and further solidify their foundation in grammar and vocabulary. Students studyTurkish as it is used in authentic media, literature, and film, and gain familiarity with Turkish culture andcivilization. The course will also address the needs of those preparing to study Ottoman. The first half of thecourse emphasizes completing skills acquired in Beginning Turkish and improving competency, while the secondhalf supplements this with an introductory sampling of excerpts from Turkish literature and texts, rangingfrom late Ottoman and early Republican period to the present time. Students will meet for 25 hours per week,including class time with the instructor and time spent with native language assistants. Several hours will beallocated each week to cultural activities such as films, presentations, and conversation tables organized aroundTurkish lunches and tea time. Intensive Intermediate Turkish is the equivalent of the 20100-20200-20300 sequenceoffered during the regular academic year at the University of Chicago. All students enrolled in Summer IntensiveIntermediate Turkish will conclude the program by participating in an ACTFL Oral Proficiency Interview.

Neural function is investigated at the levels of molecules, cells, circuits, organisms,and species, making neuroscience inherently multidisciplinary. In addition to established neuroscience careerpaths in academia, medicine, and the pharmaceutical industry, new careers for students of neuroscience areemerging in economics, software development, and other fields requiring "big data" analysis or a mechanisticunderstanding of how humans think. The course of study in the undergraduate major in neuroscience providesstudents with the background and skills appropriate for these diverse careers.The University of Chicago offers a bachelor of arts (BA) degree and a bachelor of science (BS) degreein Neuroscience. The Neuroscience major is designed to accommodate students with the range of scientificvariety that one finds at the professional level of neuroscience, including physics, chemistry, computer science,engineering, mathematics, biology, psychology, and medicine. Neuroscience faculty at the University of Chicagohave expertise in all of these areas and are distributed across the Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, and PhysicalSciences Divisions. Majoring students have the opportunity to take a broad range of courses or to specialize in aparticular area.Declaring the MajorStudents who wish to major in Neuroscience should declare the major in their second year.(Because the Neuroscience major was introduced in the 2016–17 academic year, the Class of 2020 and subsequentclasses can design a plan of study in Neuroscience from their first year. Students in the Class of 2019 may also be able tomajor in Neuroscience, depending on the courses they have already taken, although there is no way to guarantee this.)General EducationStudents majoring in Neuroscience typically begin their general education requirement in the biologicalsciences with "

It is the site of higher brainfunctions including reasoning and creativity. However, the complexity of the neocortex-it is comprised of ~20billion neurons which have 0.15 quadrillion connections between them-seems to preclude any hope of achievinga fundamental understanding of the system. Recent technological innovations have opened novel avenuesof investigation making realization of the neocortex an increasingly tractable problem.

The BA program in philosophy is intendedto acquaint students with some of the classic texts of the discipline and with the different areas of inquiry, aswell as to train students in rigorous methods of argument. In addition to the standard major, the departmentoffers two tracks. The intensive track option is for qualified students interested in small group discussions ofmajor philosophical problems and texts. The option in philosophy and allied fields is designed for students whowish to pursue an interdisciplinary program involving philosophy and some other field. All three options aredescribed in the next section.The course offerings described include both 20000-level courses (normally restricted to College students)and 30000-level courses (open to graduate students and advanced College students). There is room for a gooddeal of flexibility in individual planning of programs. Most of the requirements allow some choice amongoptions. Course prerequisites may be relaxed with the consent of the instructor, and College students may take40000- and 50000-level courses (normally restricted to graduate students) under special circumstances. Studentsshould work out their program under the guidance of the director of undergraduate studies.Students in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Philosophy.

The undergraduate curriculum in the Department of Physics leading to the BA in physics includes astrong emphasis on experiment and covers the broad fundamentals necessary for graduate study in theoreticalphysics, experimental physics, or astronomy and astrophysics, as well as some fields of engineering andmany interdisciplinary specialties requiring a strong technical background (e.g., biophysics, medical physics,atmospheric and environmental sciences).Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in physics. Informationfollows the description of the major.Program RequirementsCoursesThe curriculum leading to the BA degree in physics is designed for maximum flexibility consistent witha thorough coverage of the essential principles of physics. Degree requirements include introductory andadvanced physics and mathematics courses, as well as physics electives that allow students to pursue specificinterests.Students who plan to major in physics are encouraged to start course work in their first year. However,the program can be completed in three years, so one could start physics in the second year without delayinggraduation. Two of the physics and two of the mathematics courses can be designated as general educationcourses, with sixteen courses remaining to fulfill the major.In general, students should take the most advanced courses for which they have the appropriateprerequisites.

How do "consequentialist" ethical theories, such as utilitarianism, address suchissues? This course will address these questions by critically examining some of the most provocative defensesof consequentialism in the history of philosophy, from the work of the classical utilitarians Bentham, Mill, andSidgwick to that of Peter Singer, one of the world's most influential living philosophers and the founder ofthe animal liberation and effective altruism movements.

It seeks to understandthe basic mechanisms and functions of perception, cognition, emotion, and attitudes in guiding behavior.Although it focuses on the level of the individual, individual behavior depends on the social relationshipsand structures in which people are embedded and the biological systems of which we are comprised. Thus,psychological study encompasses a broad set of topics that overlap with a number of disciplines across thesocial and biological sciences. The requirements of the major are designed to acquaint students with theresearch methods psychologists use and to provide a foundation of core knowledge covering the major areasof psychology. This broad foundation allows students to pursue a more advanced understanding of subfieldsrelated to their own particular interests and goals for the major. The program may serve as preparation forgraduate work in psychology or related fields (e.g., neuroscience, education), as well as for students interestedin careers in social work, public policy, business, or medicine. Students are encouraged to become activelyengaged in research in the department and should consult with the director of undergraduate research abouttheir interests as early as possible.Program RequirementsAlthough no special application is required for admission to the major, majors are required to:1.Inform the Department of Psychology by completing an enrollment form available from the departmentstudent affairs administrator in Beecher 109 and inform their College adviser.2.Subscribe to the Psychology Majors Listhost at https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/info/psychology-majors.The listhost is the primary means of communication between the program and its majors or studentsinterested in being majors.

Recent theories of justice have provided both crucial conceptual clarifications ofthe very notion of 'poverty'-including new measures that are more informed by the voices of the global poorand better able to cover the full impact of poverty on human capabilities and welfare-and vital new theoreticalframeworks for considering freedom from poverty as a basic human right and/or a demand of justice, bothnationally and internationally. Moreover, these philosophers have pointed to concrete, practical steps, at boththe level of institutional design and the level of individual ethical/political action, for effectively combatingpoverty and moving the world closer to justice.

PLSC 2150,"5. Sex, Gender and War. 100 Units.This course explores the sexed, gendered, and oftentimes racialized dimensions of war. With the rise of civil warsand the decrease of interstate or world wars, the nature of warfare has changed: wars are no longer being foughtin battlefields, but neighborhoods; and combatants and civilians are no longer distinguishable. Additionally,over the last century, women's formal participation in armed groups and militaries has increased, challenging thetraditional segregation of men and women into different roles during war. As such, this undergraduate seminarexplores various dimensions of contemporary war, in order to understand how war is not only made possible,but is perpetuated and reinforced by sexed, gendered, and racialized inequalities. It draws from literature inarmed conflict studies and gender studies, as well as from contemporary representations of gender and war infilms and novels. The goals of the course are two-fold: to engage with the five themes of the course in order tounderstand, analyze, and interrogate the sexed, gendered, and racialized dimensions of war, and to developcritical writing skills for the social sciences.Instructor(s): A.

What are the biggest challenges-philosophical, political, cultural, and ethical-confrontingeducators today, in the U.S. and across the globe? How can philosophy help address these? In dealing with suchquestions, this course will provide an introductory overview of both the philosophy of education and variouseducational programs in philosophy, critically surveying a few of the leading ways in which philosophers pastand present have framed the aims of education and the educational significance of philosophy. From Plato tothe present, philosophers have contributed to articulating the aims of education and developing curricula tobe used in various educational contexts, for diverse groups and educational levels. This course will draw onboth classic and contemporary works, but considerable attention will be devoted to the work and legacy ofphilosopher/educator John Dewey, a founding figure at the University of Chicago and a crucial resource foreducators concerned with cultivating critical thinking, creativity, character, and ethical reflection.

Transnationally, racism, sexism, patriarchy, homophobia, transphobia,misogynoir, and classism affect the quality of life of Black women, particularly within nation-states with legaciesof slavery and colonialism. This course takes a historical, social and theoretical look at the roots of this inequalityand how Black women have chosen to respond to it locally and globally. This is not an introductory course onFeminist Theory. Some prior knowledge of first, second, and/or third wave feminism is expected.Instructor(s): Jennifer Jackson; Alysia Mann Carey Terms Offered: AutumnEquivalent Course(s): "

PLSC 2550,"1. Race and Imperialism in the 20th Century. 100 Units.The turn of the 20th C. marked the legal sanctioning of Jim Crow segregation in the 1896 Plessy v. Fergusondecision while the Scramble for Africa only a decade earlier had inaugurated a new era of imperial expansion.For W.E.B. Du Bois and others, these confluences indicated a singularity about the global experience of race in the20th C. Focusing on the period prior to WWII, this course is an effort at understanding this specificity throughan engagement with the politicians, statesmen, activists, and intellectuals writing in the midst of "the problemof the color line." The course exposes students to thinkers on both sides of the color line as we read Sir FrederickLugard, the colonial administrator of Nigeria and a member of the League of Nations' Permanent MandatesCommission, alongside George Padmore, the anticolonialist of Trinidadian descent who played a central rolein Ghana's independence movement. To further our insights, we engage recent commentary by scholars whohave sought to understand the racial formations of the 20th C. The course aims are 1) to trace the processes-ideological, political, and economic-through which the Jim Crow color line became international and considerthe reverberations of this internationalism, 2) to reexamine the crisis of WWI and the creation of the League ofNations in light of the "problem of the color line," and 3) to trace the intellectual roots of a global anticolonialmovement concerned with securing racial equality.Instructor(s): A.

The major recognizes that publicissues are not neatly contained within traditional disciplinary boundaries and that analysts possessing a broadrange of social scientific understanding, quantitative expertise, and communication skills are well placed tocontribute to improved public policies. Public Policy involves direct contact with policy problems, ensuring thatacademic speculations are well-informed and connected to real-world conditions.The Public Policy Studies major strives to put analysis before advocacy, stressing that compelling policyanalysis is a central component of effective advocacy. We aim to be open and helpful to students of all politicalpersuasions and challenge students to rethink clichéd responses to policy problems. The program of study forthe BA degree in Public Policy Studies is designed to introduce students to policy analysis and implementation,equip them to use quantitative and economic techniques and methods, train them in policy research, and givethem a thorough grounding in one or more specific policy areas.The program also encourages students to undertake an internship experience either during the academicyear or during the summer: the course "

In this course we read and discuss both foundational and cutting-edge articles fromneuroscience, cognitive science, education and psychology to understand how humans bridge this gap betweenthe informal and formal mathematical worlds. In doing so, we will try to understand where numbers come from,a question that bridges several areas of psychology, including how humans build theories about the world andhow language affects our thinking.

This will require an initial (and highly preliminary) proposal for how one hopes to fulfillthe requirements and an advising session to discuss the plan and resources available to support it. Thatmandatory advising is provided by the Chicago Studies staff within the Office of Civic Engagement (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/about), with a second required meeting before proposal of the capstone project.Students who complete the certificate will have that designated on their transcript. The transcriptdesignation and the certificate itself are standalone recognitions, conferred by the College and the Office ofCivic Engagement without reference to students’ formal degree programs. However, completion of the ChicagoStudies Certificate does fulfill the internship/field study requirement of the Environmental and Urban Studiesmajor.The Chicago Studies Certificate Program includes the following components:1.Introductory Civic Impact Training Experiences (at least 3)2.Chicago-Focused Courses (at least 3)3.High-Impact Community Engagement4.Capstone Project 1. Introductory Civic Impact Training Experiences (at least 3)These not-for-credit, non-curricular introductory experiences—some of which are facilitated by externalorganizations—expose students to local civic actors, civic leadership skills, and Chicago social issues, and areopen to all University of Chicago students. As a first stage of the certificate, students must participate in threeof these to help them frame, focus, and reflect on the kind of impact they hope to have as engaged scholars. Atthe end of this, students declare a focus for their certificate work: an issue, an organization, a neighborhood, apopulation.A list of currently available civic impact trainings (“modules”) may be found on the Chicago StudiesCertificate Program website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/modules). A number of existingprograms sponsored by the Office of Civic Engagement and its partners (both internal and external) may alsofulfill one or more of these requirements; students should discuss this during their initial advising appointmentwith Civic Engagement’s Chicago Studies team (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/enroll).2. Chicago-Focused Courses (at least 3)Each academic year, the University offers a wide range of courses that study Chicago in some capacity(see Courses about Chicago above for examples and the Chicago Studies Certificate Program website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/courses) for details).The Chicago Studies Certificate requires completion of three such courses with a C– or above. Successfulcompletion of any of the Chicago Studies Quarters will satisfy this requirement. Otherwise, students will needto propose and receive faculty approval for a specific theme and receive subsequent approvals for each coursechosen along the way.Petitions should be made in advance of enrollment and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, inrelation to the petitioner’s stated rationale for including specific courses in their program of study and836         Chicago Studiesengagement. The General Petition Form (https://college.uchicago.edu/sites/college.uchicago.edu/files/GeneralPetition.pdf) is available on the College website and should be directed to Dr. Sabina Shaikh(sabina@uchicago.edu) (Sabina@uchicago.edu)), faculty director for Chicago Studies. Advising on thisacademic component and selection of appropriate courses is available through the Program on the GlobalEnvironment (https://pge.uchicago.edu) and accessible via the Chicago Studies Certificate Program website(http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/courses).3. High-Impact Community EngagementProgram participants must demonstrate a sustained, impactful engagement with Chicago’s diversecommunities in the following ways:•complete at least 200 hours of community-benefiting engagement in Chicago; AND•receive a positive recommendation from a community-based supervisor of or partner in theirengagement; AND•articulate both academic learning and skills development from this experience and its relevanceto the student’s capstone project in a significant way.Advising on the selection of appropriate engagement opportunities is available through UCSC. Someexamples of existing opportunities that could fulfill this program requirement include:•200+ hours of documented volunteer engagement on a single community issue throughleadership in a community service recognized student organization•200+ hours of student employment with a single community organization or on a single issuethrough community-based Federal Work-Study•completion of the University Community Service Center's Summer Links (https://ucsc.uchicago.edu/page/summer-links-2017) internship and social justice education program•completion of the Institute of Politics (http://politics.uchicago.edu) Summer Political Internship(in Chicago)•completion of a Pozen Family Center (http://humanrights.uchicago.edu) Human RightsInternship (in Chicago)Program participants may also petition the University Community Service Center to use an experiencenot listed here toward the certificate requirements. Information about available and forthcoming engagementopportunities, as well as the mechanisms for their approval and documentation, can be found on the ChicagoStudies Certificate Program website (http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/certificate/engagement).4. Capstone ProjectA Capstone Project is a high-impact learning practice that requires students to integrate, apply, andarticulate their learning across a sequence of experiences. Many capstones will be completed during the fourthyear of study, but it is possible to complete a capstone earlier.To receive the Chicago Studies Certificate and transcript designation, program participants mustsuccessfully produce a major paper, project, or product (e.g., a discipline-based research project, investigativejournalism series, creative production, action research product, etc.) that:•integrates aspects of the student's academic and community-based learning throughout the student'sfulfillment of previous certificate components; AND•takes Chicago either as its focus OR uses it as a significant example (for works focused on broader urbanthemes); AND•responds to a community-defined priority or question, including being presented as such to one ormore relevant publics.Advising on and approval of capstone project proposals is run by the Chicago Studies team within theOffice of Civic Engagement (http://civicengagement.uchicago.edu), which can assist students in identifyingappropriate community partners, issues, and audiences for capstones from Civic Engagement’s citywide networkof collaborators. Completed capstone projects are adjudicated and validated by a small committee of faculty,staff, and community partner readers. Students are required to present their capstones at the annual ChicagoStudies Symposium.In the case of capstone projects based on or closely related to a student's formal academic work (e.g., a BAthesis), the adjudication committee will assess only the capstone’s successful integration of the student's academicand community-based learning, as required for the certificate. Such evaluations should not be taken as directionof the student's formal discipline-based academic research.In addition to the required participation in the Chicago Studies Symposium, students should also, wheneverpossible, directly present their capstones to relevant publics in the broader community as an expression ofreciprocal benefit to those whose community-based knowledge has helped to inform their completion. Where2018-2019 The College            837appropriate, capstone projects may also be submitted for potential inclusion in the Chicago Studies Annual(http://chicagostudies.uchicago.edu/annual).Questions about the Chicago Studies Certificate Program may be directed to Chris Skrable(cskrable@uchicago.edu), associate director for community-based research and experiential learning in theOffice of Civic Engagement.

We will also review current policy topics inHousehold Finance, the study of how households save, borrow, and/or use insurance to overcome unexpectedchanges in household income. In addition, we will discuss the process of filing tax returns, the prevalence ofincome tax refunds, and the various industries, both non-profit and for-profit, that have arisen around thisphenomenon. Next, students will go into the field, and work as volunteer tax preparers for a local, Chicago non-profit, the Center for Economic Progress (CEP). Students will be trained as tax preparers (which requires a 3-hour training session), learn how these services are delivered, and will also learn about the various social goalsand public benefits that are often coupled with this process. Tax season begins in late January, and the studentswill work on site at some steady frequency, until the end of the quarter. Students are also encouraged, though notrequired, to continue to volunteer until the end of the tax season, April 15th. Finally, students will produce one ofthree deliverables. They can prepare an evaluation of CEP or they can produce a policy brief, or they can producea research proposal.

Students inReligious Studies learn how to think, talk, and write about religion in a way that is well-informed, rigorouslycritical, and responsibly engaged. The study of religion investigates the way human societies construct practices,seek meanings, and pose questions about their world. These investigations may be constructive, cultural, and/orhistorical. Since it touches all facets of human experience, the study of religion is a crucial conversation partnerwith other fields of study and draws on the entire range of humanistic and social scientific disciplines. Studentsin the program are able to explore numerous religious traditions, including Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism,Islam, and Judaism, and are exposed to the sources, problems, methods, and methodologies of our diverse areasof study, including Biblical and Historical Studies; Ethics, Theology, and the Philosophy of Religions; as well asHistory of Religions, Anthropology, Sociology, and Religion and Literature. The interests of our students may bedescriptive, explanatory, and/or normative.Program RequirementsA major in Religious Studies consists of twelve courses, including one introductory course and a two-quartersenior seminar. It is preferable that students consult the Director of Undergraduate Studies and declare theirmajor in Religious Studies before the end of their second year. Students and the Director of UndergraduateStudies will work together to create a program of study. The goal is to develop depth in one area so that asatisfactory BA paper will be written in the fourth year. Students are encouraged to explore more than onereligious tradition in their courses.Students with permission to enroll in graduate Divinity courses may count these toward the major. Studentswho wish to receive credit in the major for non-departmental courses must submit a petition to the Director ofUndergraduate Studies. Such requests are decided on a case-by-case basis. NOTE: The Office of the Dean ofStudents in the College must also approve the transfer of all courses taken at institutions other than those inwhich students are enrolled as part of a study abroad program that is sponsored by the University of Chicago.For more information, visit Transfer Credit.Introductory CourseStudents in Religious Studies are required to take "

But new work finds that certain arts and culturalactivities are rising, especially among the young, in many countries. This course reviews core related concepts--political culture, social capital, legitimacy-and how they change with these new developments. We lay outnew concepts and related methods, such as a grammar of scenes, measured for 40,000+ U.S. zip codes. Scenes,nightlife, design, the internet, and entertainment emerge as critical drivers of the post-industrial/knowledgesociety. Older primordial conflicts over class, race, and gender are transformed with these new issues, whichspark new social movements and political tensions.

We explore the permeation of law ineveryday life, legal consciousness, and gap between "law on the books" and "law on the ground," as well astypes of immigrants, motivations behind migration, and national, state, and local immigration laws. The socialimpact of law is examined through the topics of liminal legality; children and families; policing, profiling, andraids; detention and deportation; and the mobilization for immigrants' rights. This course focuses on the social,political, economic, and cultural contexts of law as it relates to immigration issues.

Punishment and Social Theory. 100 Units.In this course, students examine the rise of the penal state, tracing its roots from the birth of the prison tothe ascendance of mass imprisonment. The course is organized around four lines of inquiry--(1) How is thepower to punish derived? (2) In what ways has the role of punishment in society been conceived? (3) What dothe practices of punishment produce and tell us about ourselves? (4) Are there alternatives? Taking up thesequestions, students will outline the major theories of punishment advanced by classical political philosophersand penologists (Locke, Hume, Beccaria, Bentham, etc.), and trace the trajectory of our modern impulse to punishthrough the works of the "masters of suspicion," (Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche). We will interrogate the politicaleconomy, culture, and consequences of punishment through readings on the carceral state (i.e. Alexander, Allen,Dubois, Garland, Gilmore, Gottschalk, Foucault, Harcourt, Muhammad, Melossi and Pavarini, Rusche andKirchheimer, Wacquant, Western, etc.), and conclude by raising new questions about the role, force, consequenceand alternatives to punishment in an age of mass imprisonment.Instructor(s): Reuben Miller Terms Offered: WinterEquivalent Course(s): "

Behavioral Economics and Policy. 100 Units.The standard theory of rational choice exhibits explanatory power in a vast range of circumstances, includingsuch disparate decision making environments as whether to commit a crime, have children, or seek to emigrate.Nonetheless, shortfalls from full rationality seem not to be uncommon, and are themselves, to some extent,systematic. Behavioral economics documents and tries to account for these departures from full rationality. Thiscourse looks at areas in which some modification of the traditional rational choice apparatus might most bewarranted; these include decisions that unfold over time, involve low probability events, or implicate willpower.To what extent should public policy respond to shortfalls from rationality or concern itself with promotinghappiness?Instructor(s): J.

PBPL 2882,"0. Machine Learning and Policy. 100 Units.The goal of this course is to make students better producers and consumers of machine learning tools designedto help solve public policy problems. One thing this goal requires is some understanding of the basics of machinelearning: how it works, what makes it different from the usual sort of statistical and econometric tools that wetend to use in social science studies of public policy problems, and how to implement these prediction models(which we will be doing in R, a free statistical program that now includes many machine learning packages). Butthis goal also requires some understanding of issues that are outside the usual machine learning toolkit, suchas: what sorts of public policy problems are right for these tools, and which are not; how do we know whethera new prediction tool is capable of actually improving policy decisions, not just predicting outcomes accuratelywithin some hold-out set; what additional considerations around fairness and other normative values may arisein using machine learning tools for public policy applications; and what challenges are associated with gettingpolicymakers, front-line practitioners or individual citizens to make use of prediction tools and resulting decisionaids.Instructor(s): J.

Most of ustry to understand others by putting on the cap of an "intuitive scientist," relying on our intuitions to identifyothers' thoughts and motivations and to predict others' behavior. However, decades of psychological researchsuggest that our intuitions about other people are often misguided in systematic ways. This course will enableyou to have a more accurate understanding of others' motivations, feelings, thoughts, and behaviors by teachingyou to think like a "psychological scientist" rather than an intuitive scientist. Relying on research in socialpsychology, judgment and decision-making, and behavioral science, this course will help you understand whenyour intuitions are likely to be reliable and when they are unlikely to be so, giving you important knowledgeand tools to succeed professionally and interpersonally. Managing other people-be they co-workers, customers,constituents, or competitors-is critical for professional and personal success. At the very start of your professionalcareer, your success will likely depend on having the necessary technical expertise to produce excellent workproduct for your organization. As you progress in your career, however, success will increasingly require you tomanage groups of people, to align their skills, solve interpersonal problems, and create well-functioning teams.This course is intended to provide the scientific knowledge of human thought and behavior that is critical forsuccessfully managing others, and also for successfully managing yourself.Instructor(s): Nadav Klein Terms Offered: Spring"

This era birthed empires, economies, literatures, languages, conflicts, technologies, and ideaswhose influence, both within the European continent and well beyond, powerfully shaped the advent andstructures of modernity. A list of University of Chicago faculty working in Renaissance studies can be found onthe Renaissance Studies website (https://voices.uchicago.edu/renaissancestudies/facultybydept).The minor unites the humanities and social sciences, teaching students to use the tools of multipledisciplines to examine the society, art, literature, music, and the political, economic, and historical experiences ofthe Renaissance world. A student might choose to minor in Renaissance studies in order to reach beyond the lensof one discipline to see how major figures (Machiavelli, Luther, Montaigne, Cervantes, Shakespeare) or majorevents (the Reformation, European contact with the Americas) yield different insights when examined with thediverse methods and tools of inquiry used in different departments.The minor could represent an interest distinct from the student’s major, or it could complement a majorin the social sciences or humanities for a student working on materials from the period. It could equallycomplement a major in the sciences, for students who want to understand the era (of Galileo and Vesalius) that sopowerfully shaped the way their disciplines are understood and studied today.Minor in Renaissance StudiesStudents must complete six courses for the minor. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the minor,courses eligible for the minor will come from a variety of departments and will be cross-listed with a RENS(Renaissance Studies) subject code.The Renaissance can be approached through many disciplines, including:Art History, Classics, Comparative Literature, English Language and Literature, Fundamentals: Issues andTexts, Germanic Studies, History, History, Philosophy, and Social Studies of Science and Medicine, Music, NearEastern Languages and Civilizations, Philosophy, Political Science, Religious Studies, Romance Languages andLiteratures (e.g., Catalan, French, Italian), Russian and East European Studies (e.g., Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian,Czech, Polish), and Theater and Performance Studies.At least three (3) of the above disciplines must be represented among the six (6) approved coursesthat students take to complete the minor. An updated list of eligible courses with descriptions specifyingwhich discipline each course represents will be maintained on the Renaissance Studies website (https://voices.uchicago.edu/renaissancestudies/courses). Any uncertainty about which courses represent whichdisciplines can be resolved by consulting the Renaissance Studies website or the program director.Students may petition to count courses not cross-listed as RENS if they can demonstrate that the courseshave substantial content related to Renaissance questions. A student may also petition to count up to twolanguage courses if the student can demonstrate that the language is being studied for the purpose of pursingRenaissance studies. A successful petition requires students to obtain approval from the program director, whowill contact College Advising on the student’s behalf.Courses in the minor may not be double counted with the student's major(s) or with other minors.Summary of RequirementsThree RENS courses representing three distribution areas *300Three RENS electives300Total Units600*Students must take approved RENS courses in at least three distinct disciplines (History, Philosophy,Religious Studies, etc.).

FREN 2281,"8. Figures du poète au XXème siècle (1900-1950) 100 Units.En quoi consiste la crise du moi poétique théorisée par Mallarmé à la fin du XIXe siècle ? Quelles sont les formesdu lyrisme « neuf et humaniste à la fois » envisagé par Apollinaire au début du XXe ? Est-ce qu'il est encorepossible de dire « je » en poésie ? Face à ces changements, le poète doit reconfigurer son rapport à une histoireà la fois bouleversée et bouleversante, et retrouver sa place au milieu d'un renouvèlement littéraire désormaisnécessaire. Ce cours analysera la façon dont la recherche poétique, dans son contenu comme dans sa forme,fait front au défi de la modernité sans renoncer à sa nature d'expérience de « vie intégrale » (Saint-John Perse).Par le moyen d'une variété expressive extraordinaire, le poète devient une figure souple, en mesure d'adapterson langage et son rôle aux sollicitations de la réalité. Les textes du corpus (Breton, Aragon, Char, Cocteau,Claudel, Éluard, Ponge, etc.) seront accompagnés de références critiques qui serviront de guide pour l'étudiant.À travers ces lectures on essaiera d'examiner comment le poète rend compte des expériences qui l'entourent àl'aube du XXe siècle : la guerre, le cosmopolitisme, l'appel à un engagement politique et culturel, la confluencedes arts - autrement dit, tous les champs d'application d'une nouvelle forme de lyrisme.

Baudelaire et Flaubert: la vie littéraire en l'an 1857. 100 Units.Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867) and Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880): two young men from wealthy families, twoopponents of bourgeois education, two aborted social callings, two terminal illnesses, two resounding failuresbefore literary institutions, two adventures in love, two satanic fascinations, two notorious literary trials, twoconceptions of the craft of writing, two approaches to realism, two criticisms of romantic art, two models ofpoetic inspiration, two aesthetics of language, two cults of Beauty, all for one and a unique literature. Thisseminar will be devoted to the literary life of two writers whose canon for more than a century has occupieda central place of importance in contemporary literary criticism. It will be our task to place their work inperspective within the context of the rise of modernism, which is to say, the new status of literature as of theyear 1857. We shall endeavor, thus, to discern the authenticity of the creative relationship of each artist withhimself and subsequently with others. The point will be to foreground three fundamental principles that will aidin grasping the evolution of the literary world under the Second Empire and under the Third Republic: literaryhistory, writing and the elevation of the writer (Bénichou). Our work will be based on three or four texts byBaudelaire and Flaubert, it being understood that additional works of criticism will illuminate the discussion ofthese texts.Instructor(s): D.

FREN 2381,"0. Memory and Identity in French Literature: Proust to the Present. 100 Units.This introductory-level course takes as its point of departure Marcel Proust's conceptualization of memoryas the foundation both for the self and for literature. For Proust, literary style conveys the singularity of anindividual vision while rescuing experience from the contingencies of time. Literature, identity, and memory areinseparable. Later writers will follow Proust's lead in defining literature as an art of memory; but they developthis art in different ways, whether by inventing new forms of life-writing or attempting to revive, via fiction, alived connection to history. How does memory serve as the foundation of individual or collective identities? Howdoes fiction imagine and give form to memory, and how does literature serve as a medium for cultural memory?How do literary works register the intermittence of memory, its failings and distortions, its fragility as well asits attachment to bodies and places? We will tackle these questions through close analysis of a range of texts. Inaddition to Proust, authors studied may include Yourcenar, Perec, Modiano, Roubaud, and Ernaux.Instructor(s): A. James Terms Offered: SpringNote(s): Taught in English. French reading knowledge desirable but not required.

Versailles: Art, Power, Resistance and the Sun King's Palace. 100 Units.Louis XIV's Palace of Versailles helped shape European culture and history from the Baroque era throughthe French Revolution, and it continues to animate contemporary international culture. How does thisastounding assemblage of architecture, visual arts, landscaping, performance spaces and political arenas revealtransformations in cultural tastes and power arrangements over the centuries? How do literature and artalternately support and subvert absolutist power and state propaganda? To respond we will range across media,from the bitingly satiric comedies and provocative tragedies of the 17th century (Molière, Racine), through royaledicts regulating colonial slavery and first-hand accounts of the 1789 Women's March on Versailles that upendedthe monarchy, and finally to cinematic depictions (from Jean Renoir to Sophia Coppola) and experimental palaceinstallations by the world's leading contemporary artists (Jeff Koons, Anish Kapoor, etc.).

FREN 2740,"0. Autobiographies Maghrébines: de l'Ecriture de Soi à l'Ecriture de l'Histoire. 100 Units.Dès sa naissance, la littérature maghrébine d'expression française s'est distinguée par son ancrage dans lecontexte historique, politique et socio-culturel des trois pays du Maghreb que sont le Maroc, l'Algérie et laTunisie. Souvent, l'écriture de soi a donné lieu à une (ré)écriture de l'Histoire, mettant l'individuel et le collectifen dialogue permanent. L'autobiographie, par exemple, devient le champ d'une exploration simultanée desidentités individuelle et collective, le lieu d'un témoignage littéraire autour de l'expérience coloniale et de sesconséquences, ou encore de la confrontation entre le poids persistant de la tradition et le désir de liberté etde changement. En se racontant, l'écrivain maghrébin restitue les tensions qui hantent l'espace et la mémoirepartagés tout en proposant des voies de reconstruction à travers la révolte, le désir, et le travail de la langue.En s'appuyant sur un corpus d'œuvres marquantes de la littérature maghrébine d'expression française (AlbertMemmi, Driss Chraïbi, Kateb Yacine, Assia Djebar, Fatima Mernissi, Abdellatif Laâbi), ce séminaire sera consacréessentiellement à la question du rapport entre écriture personnelle et écriture de l'Histoire dans un contextemaghrébin.

Vico's New Science. 100 Units.This course offers a close reading of Giambattista Vico's masterpiece, New Science (1744)-a work that sets outto refute "all opinions hitherto held about the principles of humanity." Vico, who is acknowledged as the mostresolute scourge of any form of rationalism, breathed new life into rhetoric, imagination, poetry, metaphor,history, and philology in order to promote in his readers that originary "wonder" and "pathos" which setshuman beings on the search for truth. However, Vico argues, the truths that are most available and interestingto us are the ones humanity "authored" by means of its culture and history-creating activities. For this reasonthe study of myth and folklore as well as archeology, anthropology, and ethnology must all play a role in therediscovery of man. The New Science builds an "alternative philosophy" for a new age and reads like a "novelof formation" recounting the (hi)story of the entire human race and our divine ancestors. In Vico, a propheticspirit, one recognizes the fulfillment of the Renaissance, the spokesperson of a particular Enlightenment, theprecursor of the Kantian revolution, and the forefather of the philosophy of history (Herder, Hegel, and Marx).The New Science remained a strong source of inspiration in the twentieth century (Cassirer, Gadamer, Berlin,Joyce, Beckett, etc.) and may prove relevant in disclosing our own responsibilities in postmodernity.Instructor(s): R.

In particular, we examine Dante's texts as part of a dense web of contending vernacular discoursesinstead of as the final word or telos of our studies. For this reason, special emphasis is given to the sonnet formas a ritualized genre in which poetic communities are formed and contending philosophical, political, andsociological visions of society are constructed and deconstructed. The role of books and manuscript culture isespecially important as we try to understand the material production and reception of the emergent vernacularliterature, and its role and function in late medieval urban Italy.Instructor(s): J.

But how was chivalry in eleventh- or sixteenth-century literature different from today's perception? What changed between historical chivalry and its fictionalrepresentation? This course aims to challenge the narrative of chivalry as one characterized by rise and fall, ora movement from virtue to parody, or spirituality to skepticism. We will see instead how each text providesmultiple layers of interpretation and how chivalry is redefined across time and space. Exploring the notionof chivalry will also allow us to focus on the so-called "spirituality" of the Middle Ages and the relationshipbetween the Renaissance and the past. We will study chivalric literature from the Chanson de Roland toCervantes's Don Quijote. A strong emphasis will be given to Italian literature, including Dante's Commedia,Boccaccio's Decameron and Ariosto's Orlando furioso.

Renaissance Demonology. 100 Units.In this course we analyze the complex concept of demonology according to early modern European culturefrom a theological, historical, philosophical, and literary point of view. The term 'demon' in the Renaissanceencompasses a vast variety of meanings. Demons are hybrids. They are both the Christian devils, but alsosynonyms for classical deities, and Neo-platonic spiritual beings. As far as Christian theology is concerned, weread selections from Augustine's and Thomas Aquinas's treatises, some complex exorcisms written in Italy, anda recent translation of the infamous Malleus maleficarum, the most important treatise on witch-hunt. We payclose attention to the historical evolution of the so-called witch-craze in Europe through a selection of the bestsecondary literature on this subject, with special emphasis on Michel de Certeau's The Possession at Loudun.We also study how major Italian and Spanish women mystics, such as Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi and Teresa ofAvila, approach the issue of demonic temptation and possession. As far as Renaissance Neoplatonic philosophyis concerned, we read selections from Marsilio Ficino's Platonic Theology and Girolamo Cardano's mesmerizingautobiography. We also investigate the connection between demonology and melancholy through a close readingof the initial section of Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and Cervantes's short story The Glass Graduate(El licenciado Vidriera).Instructor(s): A.

The (Auto)Biography of a Nation: Francesco De Sanctis and Benedetto Croce. 100 Units.At its core, this course examines the making and legacy of Francesco De Sanctis's History of Italian Literature(1870-71), a work that distinguished literary critic René Wellek defined as "the finest history of any literatureever written" and "an active instrument of aesthetic evolution." We will read the History in the larger context ofDe Sanctis's corpus, including his vast epistolary exchanges, autobiographical writings, and so-called CriticalEssays in order to detail his reform of Hegelian aesthetics, his redefinition of the intellectual's task after theperceived exhaustion of the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic moments, and his campaign against thebent toward erudition, philology, and antiquarianism in 19th-century European scholarship. We will compare DeSanctis's methodology to that of his scholarly models in France (Alphonse de Lamartine, Alfred Mézières) andGermany (Georg Gottfried Gervinus, Georg Voigt) to explore De Sanctis's claim that literary criticisms - not justliterary cultures - are "national." In the second part of the course, we assess Benedetto Croce's appropriation ofDe Sanctis in his Aesthetics (1902), arguably the last, vastly influential work in its genre and we conclude withAntonio Gramsci's use of De Sanctis for the regeneration of a literary savvy Marxism or philosophy of praxis.Instructor(s): R.

Negative Empathy, Catharsis, Fear: An Intermedial Approach to Tragedy and Its Transformations.100 Units.Literature on empathy has enormously increased in recent decades, especially from the point of view ofneuroscience and neuro-aesthetics. Scholars, however, have been focusing on the ethical dimension of empathy:on the identification with the victims, which is also highlighted by the political use of this concept. Thecourse focuses instead on the (more or less latent) empathy with negative characters, which can have a strongcathartic and social function, as a discharge of destructive and self-destructive drives, and is often linked tothe representation of fear and other strong emotions. The preliminary step is a theoretical introduction tothe category of empathy, from its first eighteenth-century conceptions to new aesthetic and psychoanalyticelaborations at the beginning of twentieth century (especially Theodor Lipp), up to recent developments comingfrom the neurosciences. Other parallel issues to be introduced are catharsis, identification, and discharge. Greektragedy, Shakespeare, Giuseppe Verdi and Pier Paolo Pasolini will be studied, as well as the TV series "BreakingBad," which brilliantly exemplifies what negative empathy means today.Instructor(s): M.

Therefore, this course's main focus is on the trajectoryof negotiations and mutual impact between these two cultural spheres, which in turn created a new set ofcultural references and associations. On the one hand, the course offers an analysis of this complex interaction,through cinematic adaptations, between Polish canonical literature and contemporary cinema; while on theother, it discusses the young generation of Polish writers' recent engagement of youth culture, consumerism,popnationalism, and the standardized subculture of nouveau-riches.

The authors whose works we are going toexamine often alternate between nostalgia and the exhilaration of being set free into the breathless possibilitiesof new lives. Leaving home does not simply mean movement in space. Separated from the sensory boundariesthat defined their old selves, immigrants inhabit a warped, fragmentary, disjointed time. Immigrant writersstruggle for breath - speech, language, voice, the very stuff of their craft resounds somewhere else.

With this broad mandate, sociology encompasses a diversity of substantiveinterests, methodological approaches, and theoretical orientations. Sociologists study diverse social phenomenaranging from online conversations, friendship, and families to neighborhoods, governments, and global markets.They study cities and communities, inequality, social mobility and social class, patterns of population changeand migration, social identities such as race, class, and gender, ethnic relations and social conflict, social mediaand digital interaction, and social dimensions of sex, health, business, education, law, politics, religion, andscience. Sociologists study the emergence, stabilization, disintegration, and wide-ranging implications of thesesocial institutions, behaviors, and meanings. Methodologies of the field range from ethnography, interviews, andhistorical research to surveys, computational modeling, and big data analysis.The University of Chicago’s sociology department was the first in the United States, and it stewards theAmerican Journal of Sociology, the discipline’s longest running sociology journal. Chicago sociology builds onthese legacies by continuing to sponsor pathbreaking research. Chicago training in sociology confers deepunderstanding of social organization and human relations, along with skill in drawing inferences from data,which has made it attractive for students considering careers in business, social media, data science, education,law, marketing, medicine, journalism, social work, politics, public administration, and urban planning. Chicago’ssociology education forms an excellent basis for specialized graduate work and affords entry to careers infederal, state, and local agencies, as well as into business enterprises, private foundations, and research institutes.Chicago’s sociology program provides a preeminent foundation for students considering careers in advancedresearch and university teaching. The program is designed to meet the needs of diverse students, and studentsdeclare a student-designed specialty that reflects their course work and BA thesis research, such as social policy orsocial analytics.Program RequirementsStudents pursuing a BA degree in sociology are expected to complete the following requirements.All required sociology courses are offered annually, and students should inquire directly of the director ofundergraduate studies if they need to know when a course will be offered in the next academic year.A. Social TheoryTwo required courses acquaint students with some of the fundamental problems and analytic perspectivesof the field of sociology."

REES 2001,"1. Gogol. 100 Units.One of the most enigmatic authors in Russian literature, Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) was hailed in his own lifetimeas the leading prose writer of his generation, a brilliant comic writer, and the innovator of the new school ofRussian Naturalism/Realism. Since his death, Gogol has been the subject of ever-greater critical controversy.Reading representative works from each period of Gogol's career, including his Petersburg Tales and DeadSouls, we will trace the author's creative development and consider it in relation to his biography and early 19th-century Russian literary and social history. We will work together to identify the characteristic features of Gogol'snarrative technique as well as the challenges to interpretation his texts pose. No knowledge of Russian required.Equivalent Course(s): 3. Dostoevsky. 100 Units.Dostoevsky was an inveterate risk-taker, not only at the baccarat tables of the Grand Casino in Baden-Baden,but in his personal life, his political activities, and his artistic endeavors. This course is intended to investigatehis two greatest wagers: on the presence of the divine in the world and on the power of artistic form to conveyand articulate this presence. Dostoevsky's wager on form is evident even in his early, relatively conventionaltexts, like The Double. It intensifies after his decade-long sojourn in Siberia, exploding in works like The Notesfrom Underground, which one-and-a-half centuries later remains an aesthetic and philosophical provocation ofimmense power. The majority of the course will focus on Dostoevsky's later novels. In Crime and PunishmentDostoevsky adapts suspense strategies to create a metaphysical thriller, while in The Demons he pairs a studyof nihilism with the deformation of the novel as a genre. Through close readings of these works we will tracehow Dostoevsky's formal experimentation created new ways of exploring realms of existence that traditionallybelonged to philosophy and theology. The results were never comfortable or comforting; we will focus oninterpreting Dostoevsky's metaphysical provocations.Equivalent Course(s): "

REES 2100,"0. Gombrowicz: The Writer as Philosopher. 100 Units.In this course, we dwell on Witold Gombrowicz the philosopher, exploring the components of his authorialstyle and concepts that substantiate his claim to both the literary and the philosophical spheres. Entangled inan ongoing battle with basic philosophical tenets and, indeed, with existence itself, this erudite Polish authoris a prime example of a 20th century modernist whose philosophical novels explode with uncanny laughter. Incontrast to many of his contemporaries, who established their reputations as writers/philosophers, Gombrowiczapplied distinctly literary models to the same questions that they explored. We investigate these models in depth,as we focus on Gombrowicz's novels, philosophical lectures, and some of his autobiographical writings. With aninsight from recent criticism of these primary texts, we seek answers to the more general question: What makesthis author a philosopher?Instructor(s): Bozena Shallcross Terms Offered: WinterNote(s): All readings in English.Equivalent Course(s): 6. Joseph Conrad's Secret Agent: (In)action, Surveillance, Terrorism. 100 Units.Course centers on Joseph Conrad's The Secret Agent: A Simple Tale. Contemporary critics often consider thisnovel the archetypal fictional work about terrorism, as it is based on the bomb attack that occurred in Greenwichin 1888. The Secret Agent demonstrates, however, much more than its prophetic significance rediscovered after9/11. Therefore, the course seeks how the novel's relevance stems in equal measure from Conrad's interest ina wider political process and his distrust of state power; in particular, the course explores how these forcesdetermine the individual caught in a confining situation. We read The Secret Agent as a political novel, thatstruggle for solutions defies chaos as well as an imposition of a single ideology or one authorial point of view.Its ambiguities and political antinomies allow for interdisciplinary readings that also present an opportunityto critically overview the established approaches to main Conradian themes. In analyzing the formation of thenarrative's ideology we discuss Conrad's historical pessimism that demonstrates with sustained irony howcapitalism breeds social injustice that, in turn, breeds anarchism. The class also focuses on how the novel exposesduplicity in staging surveillance, terrorism, as well as adjacent forms of violence or sacrifice. Critical texts includeseveral older but still influential readings (Jameson, Eagleton) and the most recent.Equivalent Course(s): "

REES 2570,"1. Memoir in Modernism. 100 Units.This course serves as an introduction to Russian and European modernism, taking the fictionalizedautobiography as its focus. In the early twentieth century the novel-memoir becomes arguably the foremostvehicle for literary modernism. We will examine the literary strategies used to represent the workings of memoryand the construction of their autobiographical worlds. What role does tradition play in foregrounding thewriters' approach to their immediate familial and cultural past? How is the experience of time reconfigured bythe processes of memory, and what rhetorical techniques are used to effect this in prose narratives? Readingsmay include James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Andrei Bely's Kotik Letaev, Virginia Woolf'sTo the Lighthouse, Osip Mandelshtam's The Noise of Time and Vladimir Nabokov's Speak, Memory, as well asselections from Boris Pasternak, Marcel Proust, Andrei Platonov, Marina Tsvetaeva and others.

Pushkin and Gogol. 100 Units.Alexander Pushkin (1799-1837) is widely considered the founding genius of modern Russian literature, especiallyin his lyric and epic poetry; Nikolai Gogol (1809-1852) injected a manic strain of magic realism to create themodern Russian novel. Apollon Grigor'ev later called Pushkin "our everything"; Dostoevsky claimed "We allemerged out of Gogol's 'Overcoat.'" During the quarter we will read a representative selection of both writers'major works, including Pushkin's verse novel Evgenii Onegin, verse epic The Bronze Horseman, and novelThe Captain's Daughter, and Gogol's novel Dead Souls in addition to his fantastic stories "The Nose" and "TheOvercoat." We will focus on close readings of the texts, paying particular attention to their experiments withliterary form, as well as attending to their broader historical contextualization. We will focus particularly onthe conceptions of realism projected by the texts and imposed by later readers.

The Effects of Schooling. 100 Units.From at least the Renaissance until some time around the middle of the twentieth century, social class was thepre-eminent, generalized determinant of life chances in European and, eventually, American societies. Socialclass had great effect on one's social standing; economic well-being; political power; access to knowledge; andeven longevity, health, and height. In that time, there was hardly an aspect of life that was not profoundlyinfluenced by social class. In the ensuing period, the effects of social class have receded greatly, and perhaps haveeven vanished. In their place formal schooling has become the great generalized influence over who gets accessto the desiderata of social life, including food, shelter, political power, and medical care. So it is that schooling issociologically interesting for reasons that go well beyond education. The purpose of this course is to review whatis known about the long-term effects of schooling.Instructor(s): R. Stolzenberg Terms Offered: Spring.

SOCI 2026,"3. Human Migration. 100 Units.At any moment, spatial location is a fixed, essential characteristic of people and the places they inhabit. Overtime, individuals and groups of people change places. In the long run, the places themselves move in physical,social, economic and political space. These movements can be characterized by their origins and destinations,as intentional or accidental, forced or voluntary, individual or collective, within political borders (e.g. the farm-to-city migration of the 1940's in the U.S), migration across political boundaries (e.g. "displacement" of pariahethnicities after World War II), and by other criteria. All of these phenomena are aspects of migration This coursereviews contemporary demographic research and theory concerning the nature of migration, and its extent,causes and consequences for individuals and collectivities. The demographic perspective absorbs a wide range ofdisciplinary perspectives, including those of psychology (e.g. individual decision-making), sociology (collectivebehavior, stratification, race and ethnicity), economics (rational behavior, macroeconomic conditions), and more.Instructor(s): R.

Wealth is more difficult for socialresearchers to measure than earnings and income, and wealthy people are notoriously uncooperative with effortsto study them and their assets. Further, wealth data conveys less information than income data about the lives ofthe middle- and lower-classes -- who tend to have little or no wealth at all. However, information about wealthgives fundamentally important insight into the values, attitudes, behavior, consumption patterns, social standing,political power, health, happiness and yet more characteristics of individuals and population subgroups. Thiscourse considers the causes and consequences of wealth accumulation for individuals, the social groups to whichthey belong, and the societies in which they dwell.Instructor(s): R.

Health, Medicine, and Human Rights. 100 Units.The World Health Organization, United Nations and other international bodies consider health a fundamentalhuman right. At the same time, most countries around the world are characterized by profound inequalities inhealth and wellbeing. In this course, we leverage sociological and social scientific concepts through a humanrights framework to understand how these inequalities in mental and physical health are perpetuated by thestructure and culture of society, with an emphasis on U.S. society. We will also examine medicine as an institutionwith a problematic history of repeated human rights violations (in the U.S. and around the world) and explorehow that history shapes the current practice of medicine, medical research, and relations between doctors andpatients. Finally, we will explore how institutions provide (or fail to provide) equal access to healthcare, and howstate understandings of the right to health influence the lives of individuals and communities.Instructor(s): Mueller, Anna; Offidani-Bertrand, Carly Terms Offered: AutumnNote(s): CHDV Distribution: B, C, DEquivalent Course(s): "

Focusing primarily on the American context, students will investigate how disease labelsinteract with social non-conformities, how medical diagnoses can serve as forms of social control, and howhealthcare inequalities emerge.

Thiscourse investigates the relationship(s) between law and society, with a focus on the American civil legal system'shistorical and current role in inequality, social problems, and social disputes. We will examine the ways in whichindividuals and groups are oriented towards and mobilize the law within the constraints of the legal system andeveryday life. We will ask: What are the roots of "equality" as the basis for addressing social discrepancies? Whatare the consequences of equality and rights forming the foundation for claims and cases in the American legalsystem? How do the overlaps of the criminal justice system, civil law, and everyday understandings of legalitycreate or deny legal outcomes? What have the legal claims made by historical and current social movementsbrought into the picture and what has been left out of frame?

This is soeven when officially many cultures grant them formal equality before the law. This course explores issuesof disenfranchisement, inequality, and violence through a focus on South Asia. We will begin with a set oftheoretical readings mainly John Locke and John Stuart Mill whose works demonstrate some early strandsof thinking about the political and cultural role (or the lack thereof) of women within the (fraternal) socialcontract. We will then move to contemporary works such as Joan Scott's Only Paradoxes to Offer (selections),Parite: Sexual Equality and the Crisis of French Universalism (selections), Leila Ahmed's A Quiet Revolution(selections), Amy Dru Stanley's From Bondage to Contract (selections) to frame the issue of differentialcitizenship and inequality in a historical and global context. Following this we turn to South Asia with aparticular focus on gender and caste inequality and the violence unleashed by majoritarian politics (both overtand covert).Instructor(s): R.

The "Age ofEmpire" has bequeathed us a wealth of literary texts, from adventure tales to more serious novels about colonialencounters and life in the colonies. Colonialism also introduced the novel as a new literary genre to manyliteratures in Asia. Over the past decades literary critics, theorists, historians and philosophers have examined theinterdependence of imperialism/colonialism and literature from many perspectives, notably in what is generallyreferred to as postcolonial theory. The present course provides a first introduction to to colonial writing andtheoretical approaches to literary practices under colonialism, to its key thinkers, concepts and methods byexamining what Empire was in the case of British India and the Dutch East Indies (today's Indonesia) and byreading English and Dutch novels together with the work of Asian writers (Forster, Rajam Aiyar, Couperus,Abdoel Moeis). We will explore key terms, such as "otherness", "hybridity", "agency", "modernity", "nationalism"as well as larger themes, such as empire and gender and sexuality or colonial knowledge formation. - Ofinterest to students of literature, history, anthropology and other disciplines dealing with 'texts'.

SALC 2570,"6. Problems in the Study of Gender and Sexuality: Inequality. 100 Units.This course analyzes inequality and the overt and covert violence that results from it. These inequalitiesare often grounded in gender and sex but also result from a complex intersection of gender, sex, and otheridentities. Inequality is what produces the experience of differential citizenship, a topic that exercises scholarsthe world over. In particular, those interested in issues of feminism, community, and ethnicity have studied whywomen (some women more than others) or particular social groups such as gay or trans groups, experiencedisenfranchisement more than their counterparts, even when, officially, many cultures/ nation states grant theirmembers/citizens formal legal equality. Many of the examples around which this course is framed emerge outof South Asia, but our analyses will be structured through an engagement with theoretical texts that addressissues of gendered oppression and discrimination in other parts of the world. Readings will include historical,anthropological, literary texts. Key themes of the course include: debates on parite in France and differentialcitizenship for religious minorities in India; caste based violence in India studied comparatively with debateson violence against aboriginal in Australia and Canada; rape and human rights; the politics of homosexuality;violence around popular and high culture; the panic around "family values".

Race, Ethnicity, and Identity in and beyond South Asia. 100 Units.Few parts of the world can lay claim to such a diverse array of ethno-linguistic, religious, and regional identitiesas South Asia. Not surprisingly, these identities have never been static. This course considers the modern historyof ethnic, religious, and racial identities across South Asia with particular attention to their representation inliterature and film. We will begin with the colonial-era "ethnographic" state and the development and reificationof caste-, religion-, and race-based classifications. We will then shift to Independence, Partition, and South Asiandiasporas. We will conclude with contemporary articulations of nationalism, with particular attention to thecase of Kashmir. Throughout the course we will focus on the social and political means through which ethnic,racial, and other identity categories are constructed-including colonial re-articulations of caste and the creationof the so-called "martial races." We will also pay attention to moments of trans-national comparison, for instanceAmbedkar's correspondence with W.E.B. Du Bois, and the relation between critiques of casteism and racism.Equivalent Course(s): "

Wives, Widows, and Prostitutes: Hindi Literature and the "Women's Question" 100 Units.From the early 19th century onward, the debate on the status of Indian women was an integral part of thediscourse on the state of civilization, Hindu tradition, and social reform in colonial India. This course will explorehow Indian authors of the late 19th and early 20th centuries engaged with the so-called "women's question."Caught between middle-class conservatism and the urge for social reform, Hindi and Urdu writers addressedcontroversial issues such as female education, child marriage, widow remarriage, and prostitution in theirfictional and discursive writings. We will explore the tensions of a literary and social agenda that advocated the'uplift' of women as a necessary precondition for the progress of the nation, while also expressing patriarchalfears about women's rights and freedom. The course is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.Basic knowledge of Hindi and/or Urdu is preferable, but not required. We will read works by Nazir Ahmad,Premcand, Jainendra Kumar, Mirza Hadi Ruswa, and Mahadevi Varma in English translation, and also look attexts used in Indian female education at the time.Instructor(s): U.

South Asian Aesthetics: Rasa to Rap, Kamasutra to Kant. 100 Units.This course introduces students to the rich traditions of aesthetic thought in South Asia, a region that includes(among others) the modern-day states of India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka. Byengaging with theories of art, literature and music from the Indic and Indo-Persian traditions, we will attemptto better understand what happens in an aesthetic experience. A central concern will be thinking about howmuch any aesthetic tradition, be it South Asian or other, is rooted in the particular epistemic and cultural valuesof the society that produced it; we will therefore explore how ideas from the South Asian tradition can help usto understand not only South Asian material, but art in other societies as well, and to re-think the boundariesof 'aesthetic' thought. Class discussion, small group work, and individual presentations will be regular featuresof the class. Two sessions will include performances by, and discussions with, performing artists (dancers andmusicians). We will also make one visit to the Art Institute Chicago.Equivalent Course(s): "

Mathematics plays a major role in all areas of statistics, from probability theory to data analysis.Statistics is an appropriate field for students with strong mathematical and computational skills and an interestin applying these skills to problems in the natural and social sciences. A program leading to the bachelor'sdegree in Statistics offers coverage of the principles and methods of statistics in combination with solid trainingin mathematics and some additional training in computation. The major can provide appropriate preparationfor graduate study in statistics or in other subjects with strong quantitative components. Students consideringgraduate study in statistics or related fields are encouraged to discuss their programs with the DepartmentalAdviser for Majors at an early stage, whether or not they plan to receive an undergraduate degree in Statistics.Students who are majoring in other fields of study may also complete a minor in Statistics and areencouraged to discuss their course choices with the Departmental Adviser for Minors. Information on the minorfollows the description of the major.General Course InformationCourses at the 20000 level are designed to provide instruction in statistics, probability, and statisticalcomputation for students from all parts of the University. These courses differ in emphasis on theory or methods,in mathematical level, and in the direction of applications.Introductory Courses and SequencesTo begin their studies in statistics, students can choose from several courses. Students and College advisersare encouraged to contact the Departmental Adviser for Introductory Courses for advice on choosing anappropriate first course.For students with little or no math background who do not intend to continue on to more advanced statisticscourses, "

Students in the College maybe admitted to Tutorial Studies at any point in their careers; their requirements will then be written to fill thetime they have left until graduation. On the whole, the New Collegiate Division prefers to admit students tothis format late rather than early: for a senior year in Tutorial Studies rather than a two-year program and fortwo years rather than three. Admission to Tutorial Studies is handled separately from admission to other NewCollegiate Division programs.Students in Tutorial Studies are held to all College requirements and to the New Collegiate Divisionrequirements, including the production of substantial written work. Tutorial Studies makes no otherrequirements of students admitted to the program, but particular students may be held to certain requirementsjudged appropriate by the tutor or the program chairman.Students in Tutorial Studies have no major; instead, all students have a tutor. A tutor is a member of theChicago faculty who has agreed to take responsibility for their work. An individual student's education isworked out between the student and the tutor under the general supervision of the program chairman. Becauseof the special burden placed on the tutor, the rule states: the student and the tutor are admitted together. Studentsmay enter Tutorial Studies only when they have found a tutor and after there has been sufficient discussionamong student, tutor, and program chairman to establish to the satisfaction of all three that:1.the student knows what he or she wants to do2.the tutor understands it and wants to take charge of it3.it is something worth doing and something that will constitute an appropriate segment of a Collegeeducation4.it can be done with the available resources5.it cannot be done effectively within any existing College program.A student in Tutorial Studies, like other New Collegiate Division students, takes both regular courses andreading courses. Reading courses may be taken with members of the faculty other than the tutor.In the past, successful Tutorial Studies students have generally belonged to one of two categories:1.students who wish to focus on some relatively narrow topic (the poetry of Baudelaire, for example) butin a rather broad way, that is, in terms of poetics, culture history, psychology, and so on.2.students who wish to construct some more conventional program that the College does not offer:American studies, for instance, or education.Program RequirementsAdmissions to Tutorial Studies are made by the master of the New Collegiate Division upon therecommendation of the program chairman. In the nature of the case, requirements in Tutorial Studies can hardlybe specified. It is expected that thirteen courses will be devoted to the immediate purposes of the student'sproject, of which several will be individual study courses with the principal tutor or other faculty members.NOTE: Courses used to meet requirements for the Tutorial Studies major must be chosen in consultation with thefaculty tutor and completed subsequent to admission into the program.Grading, Transcripts, and RecommendationsThe independent study and major papers required by the New Collegiate Division are best evaluated infaculty statements on the nature and quality of the work. In support of the independent study grades of Pass,Fail, and Incomplete, faculty supervisors are asked to submit such statements to student files maintained inthe New Collegiate Division office. Responses to the major papers and copies of the papers themselves are alsoavailable in this collection of statements, which is used to support graduate applications and to evaluate NewCollegiate Division candidates for Phi Beta Kappa, College honors, and other awards. Students should requeststatements of reference from faculty with whom they have worked.HonorsHonors are awarded in all the New Collegiate Division majors. In Tutorial Studies the essential requirementfor honors is an exceptionally distinguished senior paper. Papers considered worthy of honors by the initialreaders are referred to a third reader whose identity is unknown to the student.

TAPS 2061,"0. Adaptation & Translation in Theater-Making. 100 Units.This course combines seminar and studio practices to investigate the ways in which theater and performance-makers create work in relation to shifting contexts. How are theatre adaptations and translations shaped byaesthetics, geography, socio-economic conditions, cultural transition, shifting formulations of race, ethnicity,and gender? How do theatre-makers conceive and realize the resonance of their work within local and acrosstransnational spaces? This course explores these and other questions through practical experiments in adaptationand translation, case studies of artists, attending performances, critical readings on adaptation and translationtheory, and discussions of the relationship between art and national and transnational political imaginaries. Atthe center of the course is a visit from the artistic directors of two theater companies working with translationsand adaptations of "World Literature" for a (post)Soviet context, one based in Uzbekistan and the other inKazakhstan. We hope the exposure to their working processes will animate the questions of the course in excitingand unpredictable ways. For their final project, students will have the option of writing a critical paper, writing aproposal for a speculative work, or creating an artistic work.Instructor(s): L. Danzig, L.

Under special circumstances involving senior project needs,third-year students may petition for permission to register for a Big Problems course."Big problems" are characteristically matters of global or universal concern that intersect with severaldisciplines and affect a variety of interest groups. They are problems for which solutions are crucially importantbut not obviously available.Big Problems courses emphasize process as well as content: learning how to creatively confront difficultintellectual and pragmatic problems wider than one's area or expertise and to consider how to deal with theuncertainty that results. This often points to the importance of working in groups. If the core curriculum providesa basis for learning and the majors develop more specialized knowledge, the Big Problems experience leads tothe development of skills for thinking about and dealing with the important but unyielding issues of our time.Big Problems courses encourage linkage to BA papers, research experiences, or internships.

The course willdeal as much with ancient as with modern media, with writing, sculpture, and painting as well as television andvirtual reality. Readings will include classic texts such as Plato's Allegory of the Cave and Cratylus, Aristotle'sPoetics, and modern texts such as Marshall McLuhan's Understanding Media, Regis Debray's Mediology, andFriedrich Kittler's Gramophone, Film, Typewriter. We will explore questions such as the following: What is amedium? What is the relation of technology to media? How do media affect, simulate, and stimulate sensoryexperiences? What sense can we make of concepts such as the "unmediated" or "immediate"? How do mediabecome intelligible and concrete in the form of "metapictures" or exemplary instances, as when a medium reflectson itself (films about films, paintings about painting)? Is there a system of media? How do we tell one mediumfrom another, and how do they become "mixed" in hybrid, intermedial formations? We will also look at recentfilms such as The Matrix and Existenz that project fantasies of a world of total mediation and hyperreality.Instructor(s): W. J. T.

Although civic rights and duties are supposedly universal to all citizens in a"democratic" nation, their implementation often depends on the strength of community connections and thecirculation of knowledge across racial, class, and social boundaries. Focusing on the city of Chicago, we askhow citizens (in their roles as citizens) forge communities, make urban plans, and participate in civic affairs.How does the city construct the public spheres of its residents? Are the social practices of Chicagoans truly"democratic?" Could they be? What does "Chicago" stand for, as a political and cultural symbol? For bothChicagoans and their representatives, the circulation of knowledge depends not only on conventional media butalso on how the city is constructed and managed through digital media.Instructor(s): R.

The discoveries conveyed by the titles of many of these reports (e.g., the neural basis of love, altruism,morality, generosity, trust) have piqued the interest of young investigators, funding agencies, the media, andlaypeople alike. Such attention is a double-edged sword, however, as errors are exaggerated in importance, andoversimplifications create false expectations and, ultimately, disillusionment in what the field can contribute.It is, of course, one thing to assume that neural processes underlie all psychological phenomenon, it is anotherto claim that a given brain region is the biological instantiation of complex psychological functions like theself, empathy or loneliness.

The Affect System. 100 Units.The term "affect" typically refers to feelings beyond those of the traditional senses, with an emphasis on theexperience of emotions and variations in hedonic tone. The structure and processes underlying mental contentsare not readily apparent, however, and most cognitive processes occur unconsciously with only selectedoutcomes reaching awareness. Over millions of years of evolution, efficient and manifold mechanisms haveevolved for differentiating hostile from hospitable stimuli and for organizing adaptive responses to these stimuli.These are critically important functions for the evolution of mammals, and the integrated set of mechanisms thatserve these functions can be thought of as an "affect system." It is this affect system-its architecture and operatingcharacteristics, as viewed from neural, psychological, social, and political perspectives-that is the focus of thecourse.Instructor(s): J.

Understanding Wisdom. 100 Units.Thinking about the nature of wisdom goes back to the Greek philosophers and the classical religious sages, butthe concept of wisdom has changed in many ways over the history of thought. While wisdom has received lessscholarly attention in modern times, it has recently re-emerged in popular discourse with a growing recognitionof its potential importance for addressing complex issues in many domains. But what is wisdom? It's often usedwith a meaning more akin to "smart" or "clever." Is it just vast knowledge? This course will examine the nature ofwisdom-how it has been defined, how its meaning has changed, and what its essential components might be. Wewill examine how current psychological theories conceptualize wisdom and consider whether, and how, wisdomcan be studied scientifically; that is, can wisdom be measured and experimentally manipulated to illuminateits underlying mechanisms and understand its functions? Finally, we will explore how concepts of wisdom canbe applied in business, education, medicine, the law, and in the course of our everyday lives.

This course explicates avaried collection of this work, viewed as a critique and alternative to neo-liberalism, by economic historians (e.g.,Hobsbawn, Williams, Arrighi, Polanyi) and economists (e.g., Palley, Taylor, Stretton, Marglin, Eatwell, MacEwan,Blecker, Brenner).Instructor(s): M.

This course will explore these long-studied questions by examining the case of Jews and Christians inthe Middle East, as well as its tangled histories with Muslims and Jews in Mediterranean Europe. Co-taught by ahistorian of Jews in Iraq and an anthropologist of Copts in Egypt, we will explore histories and ethnographies toconsider the political, social, and religious dimensions of minority communities. Our syllabus also blends variousliterary genres and forms of media with academic scholarship to explore various voices in the conversation aboutJews and Christians in the Middle East-from novels, films, and poetry to theological tracts and political treatises.We raise the following questions throughout our course: What terms for coexistence have governed Jews,Christians, and Muslims in the Mediterranean? How are religious practices and traditions linked to historiesof rule? How do ideologies (e.g., nationalism, secularism, communism) shape the way minorities understandthemselves and how society understands them?Instructor(s): O. Bashkin, A.

BPRO 2640,"0. Movies and Madness. 100 Units.We propose to investigate representations of madness in fictional, documentary, and experimental film.We divide the topic this way to emphasize the different dimensions of cinematic address to questions ofmental illness, and the ways that film genres imply distinct formal and epistemological conventions for therepresentation of insanity. Documentary ranges from instructional and neutral reportage, to polemical, essayisticinterventions in the politics of psychiatry and the asylum, the actual conditions of mental illness in real historicalmoments. Documentary also includes the tendency in new media for "the mad" to represent themselves in avariety of media. With experimental film, our aim will be to explore the ways that the cinematic medium cansimulate experiences of mania, delirium, hallucination, obsession, depression, etc., inserting the spectator intothe subject position of madness. We will explore the ways that film techniques such as shot-matching, voice-over,montage, and special effects of audio-visual manipulation function to convey dream sequences, altered states ofconsciousness, ideational or perceptual paradoxes, and extreme emotional states. Finally, narrative film we thinkof as potentially synthesizing these two strands of cinematic practice, weaving representations of actual, possible,or probable situations with the special effects of mad subjectivity. Our emphasis with narrative film will be tofocus-not simply on the mentally ill subject as hero.Instructor(s): W. J. T. Mitchell, J. Hoffman Terms Offered: Not offered in 2018-2019.

This course examines fourcase studies of conquerors who attained sovereign power in times of war (conquest, civil war, revolution), whohad a foundational role in empire-building, and who consciously strove to link themselves to the divine andtranscendent. Their immense but ambiguous legacies persist to this day. Although each is distinct as a historicalindividual, taken together they merge to form a paradigm of the exceptional leader of epic proportions. Eachmodels himself on exemplary predecessors: each invokes and reinvents myths of origin and projects himself as amodel for the future. Basic themes entail mythic history, empire, the exceptional figure, modernity's fascinationwith antiquity, and the paradox of the imitability of the inimitable.Instructor(s): M. Lowrie, R.

Anxiety. 100 Units.The phenomenon of anxiety emerged as one of the leading psychological disorders of the 20th and 21st centuries.Worrying ourselves into the realm of the pathological, we now have a requisite measure of anxiety for everyprescribed stage of life. But why are we so anxious? Considering its prevalence in everyday life, the concept andtheories of anxiety have been employed surprisingly seldom as a way into film, fiction, and art. In this coursewe examine the modern origin of contemporary discourses specific to anxiety and their unique manifestation incultural artifacts. To understand the complex of anxiety in the so-called Western world, we rely on the theories ofSøren Kierkegaard, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, and Alenka Zupančič; fiction by Stoker,Schnitzler, Kafka, and Sebald; and film by Haneke, Kubrick, Ophuls, and Hitchcock.

In Euro-Americancivilization, the eighteenth-century Age of Enlightenment championed the powers of human reason againstreligion and superstition to achieve scientific progress. Buddhism in the nineteenth century was representedby the heirs of Enlightenment as a religion for the Enlightenment to the point of not being a religion at all. Bothtraditions offer pathways to freedom (or liberation?) that draw on our rational capabilities, and both sponsor theproduction of knowledge that re-visions our place in the world. But they seem to be opposed: how could reasonreject "religious" beliefs but also take part in "religious" traditions that aim to bring certain kinds of persons intobeing? We compare the mental models, discourses, methods of analysis, world-images, and practices of thesetraditions of enlightenment to assess the kinds of disciplines that their theoreticians and practitioners acquire anduse.Instructor(s): M.

BPRO 2850,"0. Sex and Ethics. 100 Units.Sex is a big problem. How do we think about sex in proximity to considering the ethics of risk, harm, and thepotential for good? Developing an account specifically of an ethics of sex requires thinking about the place of sexand sexual vulnerability in social life with an eye toward understanding what's good and what might count asabuses, violations, disruptions, or deprivations of specifically good things about sex. In popular discussion, forexample, "consent" often demarcates ethically good sex from bad sex. This course inquires whether consent isan adequate metric for sexual ethics; if it is necessary or sufficient; if certain factors (e.g., age, gender, violence)vitiate its normative force; and whether its legal definition conflicts, coheres with, or contributes to its generalcultural reception. These issues require us to think about the ways people do, do not, and cannot know whatthey're doing in sex, and complicate the aspiration to have an ethics in proximity to sex. This year's version ofthe course focuses on political theory/policy/popular scandal in relation to aesthetics and sex theory archives. Wetalk about sex in proximity to modes of comportment in love, scandal, prostitution, stranger intimacy, politicalfreedom and discipline, impersonality, and experimentality.Instructor(s): L.

Pharmacogenomics: Discovery and Implementation. 100 Units.Pharmacogenomics is aimed at advancing our knowledge of the genetic basis for variable drug response.Advances in genetic knowledge gained through sequencing have been applied to drug response, and identifyingheritable genetic variants that predict response and toxicity is an area of great interest to researchers. Theultimate goal is to identify clinically significant variations to predict the right choice and dose of medications forindividuals-"personalizing medicine." The study of pharmacogenomics is complicated by the fact that responseand toxicity are multigenic traits and are often confounded by nongenetic factors (e.g., age, co-morbidities,drug-drug interactions, environment, diet). Using knowledge of an individual's DNA sequence as an integraldeterminant of drug therapy has not yet become standard clinical practice; however, several genetics-guidedrecommendations for physicians have been developed and are highlighted.

ThroughUChicago UTEP, candidates receive a master of arts in teaching (MAT) degree and Illinois teaching certification.There are two certification pathways, Elementary (grades 1–6) and Middle Grades (5–8).The two pathways meet Illinois's new licensure structure and standards for teaching: (1) all core subjects inself-contained elementary grades 1–6; and (2) specific core subjects in departmentalized middle grades 5–8.UChicago UTEP offers a joint BA/MAT program for qualified fourth-year College students. All BA/MATstudents participate in all aspects of UChicago UTEP alongside MAT students throughout the two years of theprogram. Through the BA/MAT program, fourth-year undergraduate students complete their BA while alsocompleting the first year (Foundations Year) of the MAT program. Upon completion of the BA degree and thefirst year of the MAT program (Foundations Year), students enter the Residency Year of the program as full MATstudents.For more information about the two-year course sequence and practicum-related experiences, please visitthe UChicago UTEP (https://utep.uchicago.edu) website.Where to BeginUndergraduate students interested in the BA/MAT program should begin by discussing this option withtheir College adviser as well as speaking with Diane New-Hardy, UChicago UTEP recruiting and admissionscoordinator. The purposes of these discussions are to ensure that interested students are far enough along in theirundergraduate program to complete the major requirements for the BA (with the exception of a BA thesis, ifrequired) by the end of the third year in the College and to ensure that core course requirements for UTEP havealso been met.Interested students are advised to begin these discussions with their College adviser in the Spring Quarterof their second year in the College to determine feasibility of the program before applying to the joint program inthe Autumn Quarter of the third year. Prior to application, students must meet with the College adviser again tofill out the eligibility worksheet provided by the College as part of the application process.Eligibility and Program Requirements•UChicago UTEP is open to all College majors.•Students should have a 3.0 GPA or higher in their undergraduate major at time of application to UTEP.•By the end of the third year in the College, students are expected to have completed 36 of the required42 courses to matriculate into the BA/MAT program, including all general education requirements beforeentering the BA/MAT program as a fourth-year dual degree student. Up to six courses can be doublecounted between the BA and MAT programs.•For Illinois teaching certification, the following general education requirements must be met prior toentering the BA/MAT program. These requirements can be met through the general education requirementsfor all College students.•One science course (in any of the following areas: life, physical/chemistry, earth science, spacescience)•Two social science courses (in any of the following areas: history, geography, civics andgovernment, economics, anthropology)•One mathematics course (in any of the following areas: college-level math, number sense, geometry,probability and statistics, calculus)•One fine arts course (in any of the following areas: music, art, dance, etc.)•BA Thesis Requirements•As a part of fitting the required components of the College and the UChicago UTEP programinto the fourth year, UTEP will provide the equivalent of the BA Seminar to College students whocomplete the BA/MAT program. This will be offered to BA/MAT participants who do not enroll in theBA Seminar in the Spring Quarter of their third year. As such, UTEP BA/MAT program enrollees inmajors such as sociology and comparative human development will continue to register for the BASeminar within their department. For UTEP BA/MAT program enrollees who are in majors such aspublic policy studies, which have the BA Seminar in the Autumn Quarter of the fourth year, UTEP willoffer a replacement BA Seminar. Students must seek and receive approval from their major departmentsfor this exception.2018-2019 The College            857•The UTEP BA Seminar will mirror the approach and content that is included in the BA Seminarin other departments, including instruction and advising in identifying a thesis topic, data collection,research methods, constructing a literature review, and creating a final thesis.•For UTEP BA/MAT students, a BA focused on an approved education-related topic will fulfill thefinal paper requirements for the Autumn and Winter Quarter Foundations of Education courses.•Students enter joint residency status during the three quarters prior to the anticipated date of Collegegraduation, during which time they will be charged tuition at the UTEP master’s rates.

Undergraduate students admitted to this program pursue a specific course of studydepending on their specific research and professional interests. Students may design their own course of studyin any of the departments within the Humanities Division, such as Philosophy, English Language and Literature,or Art History, specializing in a single field or moving across disciplines. Alternatively, they may choose a moredirected course of study in a number of fields with specific Master of Arts Program in the Humanities (MAPH)program options, like Gender and Sexuality Studies, Theater and Performance Studies, Digital Humanities,Cinema and Media Studies, Classics, Cultural Policy, or Creative Writing.Undergraduate students who wish to complete an MA in the Humanities concurrently with a bachelor’sdegree should begin by discussing this option with their College adviser in the Autumn Quarter of their thirdyear and with the director of undergraduate studies in their major, followed by a conversation with the associatedirector of the MAPH Program and the dean of students in the Division of the Humanities.Undergraduate students pursuing this option are in “concurrent residence” beginning in the AutumnQuarter of their fourth year at the University and remain in this status for three contiguous quarters.Qualifications and EligibilityPermission to receive concurrent BA and MA in the Humanities degrees is granted only to thoseundergraduate students who have demonstrated, in their undergraduate work, a record of uncommon excellenceand who are sufficiently advanced in the fulfillment of the undergraduate degree requirements. The academicdemands on these students are significant and applicants are carefully reviewed in the context of both theundergraduate major and the MA in the Humanities degree requirements.Applicants should have a minimum GPA for their undergraduate work comparable to that required forhonors in the major and have completed the College general education requirements as well as 39 courses.In addition to a distinguished record of achievement during their time in the College, applicants mustconvincingly demonstrate that they will be able to complete all requirements for the two degrees by the end ofthe allotted three quarters of full-time concurrent residence. For this purpose, potential applicants should meetwith the BA/MA adviser in the College and fill out a BA/MA Worksheet. The BA/MA adviser’s signature certifiesthat prospective applicants are far enough along in their College program to complete the course requirementsfor both degrees within four years.Two-Year Language OptionYear 1During the first year, students participating in the Two-Year Language Option (https://maph.uchicago.edu/study/two-year-language-option) (TLO) move through the MAPH year (https://maph.uchicago.edu/study/maph-year) in the traditional manner—a required core course in the Autumn Quarter, seven elective courses, andcompletion of a thesis in the Spring Quarter. However, BA/MA TLO students must devote at least one of theirelectives to language study every quarter. Students are eligible for College aid in the first year.Year 2In the second year, BA/MA TLO students take nine courses—three electives and any outstanding languagestudy courses for a minimum of nine language courses over the two years. Students are no longer eligible forCollege aid, but, in the second year, TLO students receive a scholarship that covers 90 percent of that year'stuition. To receive this scholarship, students must have completed all nine first-year courses by the start ofAutumn Quarter and maintained a 3.5 GPA in those courses.For more information, please email ma-humanities@uchicago.edu or contact Maren Robinson(marenr@uchicago.edu), associate director, at 773.834.1201.Time LimitsThis course of study is not intended to prolong registration beyond four undergraduate years for thosecompleting the standard BA/MA option or five years for the Two-Year Language Option. All course registrationsfor both degrees must be completed in three quarters after enrollment into the MAPH Program for the standardBA/MA option or six quarters after enrollment for the Two-Year Language Option. Students who have finishedall requirements for the BA and the MA in the Humanities in the Spring Quarter may take both the BA and theMA in the Humanities degrees at Convocation in June. Students in the TLO may take the BA in the fourth yearand the MA in the fifth year at Spring Convocation.Registration, Tuition, and Financial AidTo receive at the same time both the BA degree and the MA in the Humanities degree requires that the lastthree quarters of the undergraduate course of study be spent in full-time (three courses per quarter) registrationstatus in MAPH. Students are to register for a minimum of nine graduate courses. Three graduate-level courses2018-2019 The College            859may be double counted, that is, applied to both the College and the MAPH requirements. (Students may petitiontheir director of undergraduate studies to apply the three graduate-level courses to their undergraduate major;otherwise the courses will be applied to general electives). For each of the three quarters in which the studentsare registered in MAPH, they pay tuition at the graduate tuition rate, which is somewhat higher than theundergraduate tuition rate.*Students are not eligible for financial assistance from the Humanities Division. However, any awards astudent receives from College Aid will continue in the MA year. Students in the TLO may be eligible for fundingin the fifth year.*Students pursuing a BA project are typically expected to register for one or two BA workshops in theirfourth year. These workshops count as courses in the undergraduate program and are in addition to thenine graduate courses associated with the MAPH curriculum. Joint degree candidates should be awarethat registration for a fourth course in any term may result in higher tuition.Course RequirementsStudents will be required to take "
MAPH 3010,"0 Foundations of Interpretive Theory (the MAPH core course).The core starts two weeks prior to the beginning of Autumn Quarter and is only offered in the autumn. Inaddition to the core, students take eight courses, three per quarter, over the course of the year. One of thesecourses is "
MAPH 3020,"0 Thesis Writing Workshop A/0 Thesis Writing Workshop A)with their precept groups. Students exchange drafts with their peers and workshop their writing in biweeklyto weekly sessions. In addition, preceptors are available for individual consultations as the thesis workshopprogresses. During the spring, students participate in a for-credit workshop ("
MAPH 3040,"0 Thesis Writing Workshop B.Students prepare their theses under the supervision of faculty members and their preceptors. Duringthe winter, students participate in a non-credit thesis workshop (0 Thesis WritingWorkshop B). Preceptors divide their group into subgroups for weekly or biweekly meetings, supplementing thiswith individual meetings.For courses counting toward the MA in the Humanities degree, including any courses that are doublecounted, students must earn a B- or better in the core, must maintain a B average with no grade lower than B-,and must earn a B or better on their thesis.Application ProceduresStudents interested in obtaining both the BA degree and the MA in the Humanities degree should submit anonline application (https://humanities.uchicago.edu/students/admissions/apply-now).
