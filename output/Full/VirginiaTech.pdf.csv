The following procedure applies to requests for changes to the name appearingon a student's education record:Complete Request for Change in Name form in the Office of the University RegistrarProvide a photocopy of a Social Security card that reflects the new name and a valid drivers license orother form of photo identificationProvide a photocopy of a birth certificate, marriage certificate or license, divorce decree, court order, ornaturalization papers including certificate number, petition number, and registration numberPlease note that all documentation used in support of this request should reflect the name for which you arerequesting the change.The Privacy Act of 1974 (U.S. Public Law 93-579, Sect. 7) requires that the university notify students thatdisclosure of a Social Security number is voluntary unless employed by the university or receiving federalfinancial aid. Pursuant to the 2003 State Code of the Commonwealth of Virginia, no student identification cardmay display the social security number as an identifier. Effective with students entering Fall 2003 and beyond,a generated identification number will be utilized as the default unique identifier. This generated number willbe nine digits in length and will begin with the number, "9", nine. The generated student identification isdefined as personally identifiable information by federal legislation, FERPA (Family Educational Rights andPrivacy Act) (U.S. Public Law 93-579, Sect. 7), and is prohibited from disclosure except to education officialswith legitimate educational interest.For students who entered Virginia Tech prior to Fall 2003, the social security number was the default studentidentification number. Effective with the entering class of Fall 2003, a nine digit generated identifier is assignedto each student. Use this identifier when the student identification number is requested by a university official.Important note: disclosure of the social security number may be required by different university offices ifrequired by the Code of the Commonwealth of Virginia or Federal statute.Required Demographic InformationVirginia Tech policy requires annually the collection of specific demographic data for each student: localmailing address, emergency contact entry or emergency contact confirmation, VT Alerts Opt In or Opt Outaction, and review of the Virginia Tech Student Conduct Policy. Students will be prohibited from registrationuntil the information is provided.Missing Person ContactStudent(s) may denote a specific third party as emergency contact as primary in cases of missing person(s).Visit Hokie SPA, choose the Hokie Plus menu, add 'new emergency contact'. In the pull down selection forrelationships, choose "Missing Persons Contact".

In accordance with state policy, Virginia Tech accepts credit from Advanced Placement,International Baccalaureate, and Cambridge Exam based on annual faculty and university program review.College Level Examination Program (CLEP)CLEP is a national program that offers students credit by computer-based examination. This allows studentsto have the opportunity to obtain recognition for achievement in specific college courses. Students shouldrequest their official CLEP exam results directly from the College Board at: www.collegeboard.com. VirginiaTech's CLEP school code is 5859. CLEP credit can be viewed on Hokie SPA under the grades menu. Amaximum of 12 credit hours may be awarded.2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuRefer to the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.vt.edu/registration-multi-brief/ap-ib-clep-credit.html for information and to view the CLEP Credit Table. Questions about CLEP credit shouldbe directed to the Office of the University Registrar at registrar@vt.edu.Credit by ExaminationCredit may be allowed by special examination where exceptional command of a subject can be demonstratedin lieu of formal course work. This privilege is not available to a student who has previously audited or enrolledin the course, or has previously attempted credit by examination in the course. If credit by examination isdeemed appropriate, the offering department shall have full responsibility for determining the type ofexamination to be given and what constitutes a passing grade. A maximum of 12 hours may be awarded.Credit established by examination may not be used to satisfy the in-residence requirements for graduation. Nogrades or quality credits will be assigned.There is a per-credit fee for the examination. The current fee is $10.00 per credit hour and is subject tochange at the beginning of an academic year. Only currently enrolled undergraduate students are eligible forspecial examinations allowing university credit. Official approval must be obtained from the head of thedepartment offering the course.Credit for ROTC CoursesIn some majors, not all ROTC courses may be applied toward a bachelor's degree. Students should consulttheir approved major checksheet for specific information on which courses will count toward their degree.Credit Hour SystemVirginia Tech uses the credit-hour as its unit of credit in the semester calendar system. Course descriptionsunder the departments of instruction (in the chapters on the various colleges) indicate the number of creditsreceived per term.Dean's ListUndergraduate students who attempt at least 12 credit hours with all credits graded on the A-F option andwho earn a 3.4 GPA for either spring or fall semester will be included on the Dean's List for that term. TheDeans' Lists are not compiled for summer sessions. Any notifications or certificates indicating inclusion on theDean's List for a particular term are issued by the student's academic dean.Examinations and Re-ExaminationsFinal examinations are held at the close of each term according to a schedule established by the university.An instructor may not change the date or time of a final exam without the approval of the dean of the college.Students may request permission from their college dean to reschedule a final exam if they have conflictingexams or if they have three final exams in 24 hours. Otherwise, permission to reschedule a final exam isgranted by the dean only in very unusual circumstances. Deferred final exams may be authorized only by thestudent's academic dean or by the Schiffert Health Services.Re-examination of one final exam is available only for students who are candidates for degree in the sameterm as the final exam.After a term is over, a re-examination in one course in which the final grade earned is C- or below may beauthorized if the student was enrolled in the course during the final term of his or her senior year and if asatisfactory re-examination in the course will qualify the student for graduation. The student must make the re-examination request to the dean and must complete the exam as soon as possible after the first examination.For the student to be granted a re-examination, approval is required by the instructor, the student's departmenthead, and the student's academic dean. In determining the validity of the student's request, consideration isgiven to class performance and completion of assigned work. The University Registrar provides verification ofcompliance with the requirements of this policy.Grade Appeal ProcedureAs Per University policy, the assignment of a grade is the sole prerogative of the instructor of the class. It isincumbent on the instructor to establish the criteria for grading in the syllabus that is distributed at thebeginning of the term. All grades are to be based on established grading criteria and not on personal conductor opinions unrelated to academic standards. An individual student may not do extra work to raise his/hergrade. If a student feels that a grade has been calculated incorrectly or has been assigned in a prejudiced orcapricious manner, the student should discuss the matter with the instructor. If discussion between theinstructor and the student cannot resolve the issue, the student should appeal to the department/divisionhead. In the unusual circumstance that resolution does not occur at the departmental/divisional level, thestudent may appeal to the college dean who will attempt to reconcile the matter by whatever mechanismseems most appropriate for that college and for that case. A grade appeal must be made by the student assoon as possible but no later than the end of the student's subsequent term of enrollment after the grade inquestion has been assigned.Grades and Grade PointsThe academic achievement of a student in a specific course is rated as follows:Letter GradeGrade Pointsfor each hourA grade of "I" (incomplete) may be given when the requirementsof a course other than the final examination have not beencompleted due to illness or extenuating circumstances beyondthe student's control. The "I" grade is the prerogative of theinstructor.To remove an "I" grade, lecture course requirements must besatisfied during the student's first subsequent term of enrollment,and laboratory course requirements must be satisfied prior to theend of the first term during which the course is offered and thestudent is enrolled. Incomplete and "X" grades are automaticallyconverted to "F" if requirements are not fully satisfied during theperiod of time allowed.An "NR" grade is assigned automatically by the system when astudent is enrolled for a class and no other grade is assigned bythe instructor. The "NG" is intended to be a grade distinguishablefrom those initially assigned by the instructor and thus to indicateclearly the origin of the grade.”W” Grade: Courses from which a student withdraws under theterms of the policy, will appear on their transcript with a "W"grade, but will not count in the GPA hours nor in any GPAcalculations. The "W" signifies that this policy was invoked anddoes not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for useremain the student's purview.Grade Point Average (GPA) is computed by dividing the totalnumber of quality credits earned by the total number of hoursattempted at Virginia Tech, except courses passed on aPass/Fail basis and courses with an "X" (Continuing Course)."NG" grades are computed as "F" grades in determining GPA.The GPA is unaffected by the "I" grade, unless or until the "I" isA (Excellent)4.0A-3.7B+3.3B (Good)3.0B-2.7C+2.3C (Fair)2.0C-1.7D+1.3D1.0D- (Barely Passing)0.7F (Failure)0.0I (Incomplete)---NG (No Grade)---NR (Not Reported)---P (Passing)---RP (RepeatedCourse)---S (Satisfactory/creditsonly)---W (CourseWithdrawn)---X (ContinuingCourse)---converted to an "F" for failure to complete the courserequirements within the allotted time. All courses repeated countin the calculation of the grade point average unless changed toPass/Fail per policy.Repeated Courses: A student may not repeat courses in order toimprove his or her grade average where a grade of "C or higherhas been earned. An assigned grade of "A-D" for the secondoccurrence will be changed to a grade of "P" whenever agraduation analysis (DARS report) detects a repeated coursewith a "C" or better grade. Repeating a course where the courseis "C-" or below, both instances of the graded course will becomputed in the grade point average.Grades (Midterm)Midterm grades are produced for freshmen and transfer students whose first term of enrollment is fallsemester. Beginning Fall 1996, students whose first term of enrollment is summer will also receive a midtermgrade report during fall semester. "Satisfactory" is given for work earning a grade of C or better and"unsatisfactory" is given for work earning a grade of C- or below. The midterm grade is not part of thestudent's permanent academic record and is only intended to be an early indication of the student's progress.Graduation Requirements (Grade Hours Passed orCompleted)The "total credits" figure on the displayed grade report is not necessarily the same as the total hours (oftenreferenced as hours passed) required for completion of the degree (not all credit hours are effective towardgraduation requirements). Students are responsible for verifying required hours for completion by reviewingtheir degree analysis (DARS) with their advisor.Listed below are a few examples of typical situations yielding "pass" hours which must be subtracted todetermine the total credits useful toward graduation requirements:Transfer and/or advanced placement credits that have been subsequently duplicated by courses atVirginia Tech.Credits earned at Virginia Tech that have been duplicated by repeating courses or taking courses ruledto have duplicating credit.Transfer credits allowed from a two-year college that are in excess of one-half of the total credit hourrequirement for the curriculum.Credits for Physical Education Service Activities courses (now listed under HNFE), which exceed atotal of two, the maximum allowed toward a bachelor's degree.Credits for military science that exceed the total specified by the college for the student's curriculum.Credits on the pass/fail grading system that exceed 12 credit hours allowable exclusive of pass/fall onlycourses.Credits for courses that do not count towards the degree, (e.g. "
UNIV 1004," College Success Strategies)..Obsolete Academic RecordsUnder the "Obsolete Academic Records Policy," former Virginia Tech students returning to the university afteran absence of at least five years may request in writing to have their academic records evaluated by theappropriate academic dean. Such transcripts will be evaluated in the same manner that transfer studenttranscripts are considered; credits will be allowed only for those courses appropriate for the degree. Thegrades for these allowable courses will not be factored into the student's GPA, but all courses will remain partof the student's permanent record.Pass/Fail Grading SystemA limited pass/fail (P/F) grading system is available to encourage students to enrich their academic programsand explore more challenging courses outside their majors, without the pressures and demands of the regulargrading system. The P/F grading option is available to all undergraduates who have completed a minimum of30 credit hours at Virginia Tech and have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above. These restrictions do not applyto courses that are only offered P/F. No required course or course used for the Curriculum for LiberalEducation may be taken on a "P/F" basis (unless only offered on a P/F basis).Under the pass/fail system students are allowed to attempt twelve (12) credit hours in their degree program ona pass/fail basis exclusive of courses only offered pass/fail. Students enrolled in five-year designatedprograms (College of Architecture and Urban Studies) may attempt twelve (12) credit hours or ten percent ofthe total hours required for the degree whichever is greater. Courses offered pass/fail only are not included inthe twelve total hours allowable under the pass/fail system. Additional degree programs may not be used toincrease the number of pass/fail credits that a student is permitted to use toward any degree. No more thantwo courses per term may be taken P/F, excluding physical education activity courses and required coursesoffered on a P/F basis only.Under the P/F grading system, a "P" is granted for earning a "D" or better in the course; otherwise, an "F" isgiven. A "D-" is a failing grade under the P/F option. The "P" or "F" is recorded on the student's transcript andcredit is given if the course is passed. If the course is failed, the "F" is considered equivalent to an "F"received under the "A-F" grading system and is included in calculation of the grade point average (GPA).Once credit is received for a course taken under the P/F system, the course cannot be repeated under the "A-F" grading system.Any course to be taken under the P/F option should be designated as such upon request for thecourse. The student may change grading options to P/F until the drop deadline and to A-F until the deadlinefor resigning without penalty.Repeat Course PolicyBeginning Fall 2016 students may only attempt a course three times. An "attempt" is when a student isenrolled in a course on the last day to add courses during each semester. Courses designated as repeatablecredit (to the limit allowed) are excluded from this policy (e.g. independent studies, internships, etc.).All course repeats should be done in consultation with a student's academic advisor. Any student who enrollsfor a fourth attempt will be dropped from the course. If a student's extenuating circumstances preventsuccessful completion of the course on a third attempt, the student may appeal (petition) to repeat the courseagain. For more information regarding the appeals process, please refer to your academic dean's office.Repeating a course subsequent times may affect financial aid and eligibility for certain programs. Studentsreceiving financial aid should check with University Scholarships and Financial Aid to determine what, if any,financial aid implications there are for repeating courses. Veterans, athletes and international students mayhave additional rules associated with course repeats. Check with the appropriate department for additionalinformation.Study WeekStudy week refers to the last three calendar days of classes for each semester. All written work, with theexceptions noted below, should be assigned so that it can be graded and returned during a regularlyscheduled class meeting of the term. In-class hour-long examinations or other major in-class writtenassignments or tests shall not be given during study week. The exceptions for undergraduate courses are:Dates for turning in term papers and project reports may be set at the discretion of the instructor,provided that the student is not to be held responsible on the final examination for the subject mattertherein.In laboratory courses or other courses that do not warrant a final examination during the examinationperiod, an examination, if required by the department and/or instructor, may be given during the lastregularly scheduled laboratory or class period.Regularly scheduled final examinations, when special permission has been granted by the dean of theappropriate college.Graduate courses also have specific exceptions which may differ from those for undergraduate courses.Contact the Graduate School for details.Transfer CreditsEnrolled students in good standing at Virginia Tech must receive pre-approval from their academic dean'soffice to transfer credit to Virginia Tech. Pre-approval from the academic dean does not guarantee transfer ofthe course if the student has duplicate credit in the approved course. Students must review their degreerequirements (viewing DARS) to assure credits are degree applicable. Students who have been placed onacademic or judicial suspension by the University are not eligible to transfer credit for terms of enrollment thatcoincide with their suspension term(s).The rules below govern the transfer of credit on a university level. Some colleges at Virginia Tech haveadditional policies and procedures regarding transfer credit. Students are responsible for consulting with theacademic dean's office in the appropriate college to discuss their plans to transfer credit, and to requestinformation on the college's specific policies and procedures regarding transfer.Courses for transfer must be taken at an accredited college or university.Courses must be college-parallel, not terminal courses in a vocational program.Only courses with a "C" grade or better will transfer. Note: A "C-" will not transfer.Credits will not transfer for students who are classified as non-degree-seeking students.Course equivalencies will be determined by the Office of the University Registrar.Credit hours transfer; grades do not transfer.No more than 60 (sixty) semester hours may transfer from the Virginia Community College System(VCCS).Of the last 45 semester hours before graduation, a maximum of 18 semester hours may be transferhours.Many colleges and universities will require a letter of good standing from Virginia Tech before they willenroll a student from another university who wishes to transfer credits back. Virginia Tech students canrequest this letter certifying their good standing by completing a "Request for Certification" form in theOffice of the University Registrar.Upon completion of the course(s) and posting of grades, students are responsible for requesting that anofficial transcript be sent directly to the Office of the University Registrar at Virginia Tech as soon aspossible, but not later than two semesters after the work is completed."W" Grade PolicyThe policy is intended to assist undergraduate students who find themselves enrolled in undergraduate levelcourses for which they are insufficiently prepared, or for those who initially enroll in majors that theysubsequently change. This policy allows currently enrolled students to designate a grading option of "CW" to acourse. Courses with this option are not gradable but remain on the academic transcript with the letter gradeof "W". A maximum of three (3) courses (regardless of credit) may be dropped beyond the normal six-weekdrop deadline date during a student's undergraduate academic career at Virginia Tech subject to the followingstipulations:Students must formally request to apply the W Grade option to a course by the last day of classes ofeach term. The deadline appears in the deadlines listing of the online Time Table of Classes.Courses with the new grade mode of "W" will appear on the transcript with a "W" grade, but will notcount in the GPA hours nor in any GPA calculations. The "W" signifies that this policy was invoked anddoes not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for use remains the student's purview.There are no refunds of tuition and fees as a result of application of the policy. However, utilization ofthis grade option policy may affect Reasonable Academic Policy requirements for continued receipt offederal financial aid. Students are urged to consult with their financial aid advisor.A student decision to invoke this policy is irrevocable and unappealable.Application of the W grade option may not be employed to reduce or obviate any penalty otherwiseaccruing to students under the University Honor System. Previously processed W grade options will bevoided if the course is penalized per an Honor System action.Students may request a W grade option change for any course, irrespective of the evaluation earned in itup to the point of their request for withdrawal. However, if a registration hold exists at the time ofapplication of this policy, the student must take action to remove the hold within five (5) working days ofthe application or the request will be voided. Students are responsible for resolving their registrationholds with the appropriate university office.Students already enrolled when this policy takes effect who have exercised their option to use thepreviously existing Freshman Rule shall not be eligible to use this policy.To exercise this option, interested students should see their academic advisor to obtain a course withdrawalform and submit it to their designated departmental representative and academic dean for approval.© 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the UniversityRegistrarAdmissions InformationAcademic CredentialsAdmission (Undergraduate)Admission (Freshman Process)Admission (International Applicants)Admission (Non-Degree-Seeking Students)Admission (Transfer Process)Advanced PlacementAdvanced StandingApplying to Graduate SchoolApplying to Summer SessionsEntrance TestsEqual Opportunity / Affirmitative Action StatementInternational BaccalaureateNew Student ProgramsRequirements (Computer)Requirements (Minimum Freshman Entrance)Student Health HistoryTransfer Student Credentials EvaluationTransfer Policy of Virginia Community College StudentsUniversity of Cambridge International ExaminationsAcademic CredentialsAcademic preparation for admission to Virginia Tech is best achieved by sustaining an academically rigorouscourse selection throughout high school.

The university is committed to maintaining a working and a study environment free ofsexual harassment. Accordingly, in compliance with Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 andTitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, it is the university's policy not to tolerate any verbal, nonverbal,or physical behavior which constitutes sexual harassment (please see University Policy 1025; theUniversity's policy on harassment, discrimination, and sexual assault). Responsible employees are required toreport their knowledge of sexual harassment to the University's Title IX Coordinator. Personnel withsupervisory responsibilities are required to take immediate and appropriate action when incidents of allegedsexual harassment are brought to their attention and should do so in consultation with the University's Title IXCoordinator. Violations of the policy prohibiting sexual harassment may lead to disciplinary actions, includingreprimand, suspension, or termination of employment or academic status.Sexual harassment is defined as conduct of any type that is based upon a person's sex (including pregnancy),and unreasonably interferes with the person's work or academic performance or limits participation inuniversity activities, or creates a working or learning environment that a reasonable person would find hostile,threatening or intimidating. Sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, sexualjokes, and unwelcome sexual touching, among other things.Faculty, staff, students, and applicants for employment or admission with complaints of sexual harassmentshould contact the Office for Equity and Accessibility for resolution options. Individuals may file a complaint ofharassment and/or discrimination by returning a complaint form.Faculty, staff, and students may file complaints outside the university. Students may file complaints with theOffice of Civil Rights of the Department of Education. Faculty and staff may file complaints with the EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission.Anyone seeking guidance, resources for support, or general information may contact the Office for Equity andAccessibility at equityandaccess@vt.edu.

Areceivable becomes past due if payment is not received by the payment due date. At ninety days past due,the receivable becomes delinquent.For currently enrolled students, the primary collection tool is the placement of a "HOLD" by the Office of theUniversity Bursar on a student's record. This "HOLD" restricts certain student activities such as the ability toadd or drop classes, receive grade transcripts, register for future academic terms, and may also result in ahold on your diploma if you are a candidate for graduation. Once established, the "HOLD" remains in placeuntil the debt is paid in full. When a student is no longer enrolled, the collection procedures utilized for other"non-student" receivables are implemented.Individuals are responsible to pay all fees and charges owed to Virginia Tech. If the individual defaults onpayment, has a returned check, e-check, or debit of said fees and charges, or has any delinquent amountowed, the individual must pay a penalty fee, interest at the highest rate allowed by law or as agreed to withVirginia Tech, and all reasonable administrative costs, collections fees, and attorney's fees incurred in thecollection of amounts due the university. Students will be notified by an email sent to their Virginia Tech emailaddress to alert them that a statement has been generated. Virginia Tech and their respective agents orcontractors may contact individuals regarding any amounts owed, at the current or any future number providedfor the cellular phone or other wireless device using automated telephone dialing equipment or artificial or pre-recorded voice or text messages.Addresses must be kept current and can be changed by students as needed on Hokie SPA. Non-receipt of e-bill notification is not a valid defense for non-payment; it is the responsibility of the individual who has incurredthe debt to see that the debt is discharged.For non-students, a dunning message is included on each month's statement alerting the customer to the nextcollection steps that will be taken. If payment is not forthcoming within the stated period, the account and allpertinent information are forwarded to an outside collection agency for further collection efforts. In addition, theaccount is reported to national credit bureaus, thus affecting the debtor's credit rating.In addition to the above measures, the university also lists the account with the Virginia Department ofTaxation for set-off debt collection procedures. This means that any state income tax refund or paymentprocessed through the State Treasurer's Office to the debtor will be reduced by the amount of the receivableowed by the debtor.Office of the University Bursar (0143) Student Services Building, Suite 150, Virginia Tech 800 Washington Street SW Blacksburg, ): PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGIONA consideration of religious belief and its justification with attention to such philosophical issues as the natureand existence of the Judeo-Christian-Muslim God, proofs for the existence of God, the problem of evil, areligious basis for ethics, the nature of faith, and the variety of religious beliefs.

To this end, the Honors College providesopportunities and challenges founded on meaningful and sustained relationships with faculty, independentlearning, undergraduate research, place-based and problem-focused experiences, and intellectualengagement in global contexts. Our requirements are designed to maximize the disciplinary depth,transdisciplinary capabilities, and purpose-driven engagement that are the hallmarks of the VT-Shapedstudent experience.AdmissionsThe freshman and transfer applications to Virginia Tech automatically include consideration for admission tothe Honors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships. The HonorsCollege does not consider minimum test scores. We look holistically at an applicant's experiences andconsider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, self-awareness and reflection on involvement, andauthenticity. Transfer students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.60 or better at their previous institution.Currently enrolled Virginia Tech students will receive an invitation to apply to the Honors College at the end ofeach fall or spring semester provided they have achieved a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA and have at leastfour (4) semesters remaining at Virginia Tech before they graduate.Honors Laureate DiplomaVirginia Tech Honors College students work toward an Honors Laureate Diploma. This diploma offers twooptions: the first is self-directed by the student, the second maintains that flexibility, but focuses the honorscredit options around a particular curricular area established in advance by the Honors College in collaborationwith disciplinary departments.The Four Elements of an Honors Education are the foundation of an Honors Laureate Diploma. The Elementsare Honors College Curriculum, Disciplinary Depth, Transdisciplinary Capabilities, and UndergraduateResearch & Guided Experiential Learning. Students are required to earn at least six honors credits inelements two, three, and four. Upon graduation, students are required to complete no less than thirty totalcredits in the four elements. Visit our website at http://www.honorscollege.vt.edu for more information.An honors diploma appears on the Virginia Tech diploma as a special designation and is not a separatedocument.Honors Academic RequirementsThe Course of Study Planner & GPAThe Course of Study Planner (COSP)To demonstrate potential to earn an Honors Laureate Diploma, the Honors College expects thatstudents receive approval on their COSP by the end of their first semester in Honors.GPATo demonstrate that students can meet the level of academic achievement we expect in Honors,students are required to achieve a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA after two traditional semesters inHonors. A 3.6 or better cumulative GPA from the semester at Virginia Tech immediately previous toentering the Honors College may count toward this requirement.GPA Flex PeriodOnce students accomplish the above goals, they may enter the GPA Flex Period. The GPA Flex Periodis a time in which the Honors College no longer monitors GPA. This gives students the freedom to takeacademic risks that can become some of their most educational experiences.Graduation RequirementStudents in the GPA Flex Period must achieve a cumulative 3.30 or better GPA and complete honorsdiploma requirements. (Students who never receive COSP approval and never enter the GPA FlexPeriod are required to maintain a 3.60 cumulative GPA after every semester until the planner isapproved or upon graduation.)Honors Diploma ProgressComplete at least thirty honors credits. Elements Two, Three, and Four each require at least six honorscredits. Earn honors credit at least once every twelve months and complete the yearly Progress Survey.Grading ScaleTake courses as A–F unless P/F is the only option.Honors AdvisingA primary function of the Honors College is to support student efforts to individualize their education through aself-designed honors diploma that complements their departmental degree(s). Students can find support in theHonors Peer Advising Center and with the honors staff.The Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors PeerAdvisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors PeerAdvising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students.The Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors PeerAdvisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors PeerAdvising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students.The honors staff also welcomes student appointments and walk-in visits. Each staff member has a distinctspecialization with which they can assist students.Furthermore, advising for major national scholarships, such as Rhodes and Marshall, is available through theHonors College for all Virginia Tech students.Honors Residential CommunitiesHonors College students have two Honors residential community options: the Hillcrest Community of about100 students in Hillcrest Hall and the Honors Residential Commons of about 320 students in East AmblerJohnston Hall. Both communities are multigenerational and multidisciplinary, housing first-year students tofifth-year seniors from all seven colleges at Virginia Tech.Honors students are not required to live in an Honors residential community. Many students live off-campus orin other living-learning communities or residence halls.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (UH)1004: TOPICS FIRST-YEAR HONORS SEMA course for first-year University Honors students that is facilitated by students and faculty.

First, itadministers the University Studies and Explore Technology programs for new undergraduate studentswho want to explore a variety of degree programs before they commit to one particular major. Studentswho enter Virginia Tech as University Studies or Explore Technology are not limited to pursuing a specificmajor in their first year. With the guidance of a professional academic advisor, students research the fullrange of degree programs related to their interests and design programs of study that meet graduationrequirements while providing the academic flexibility to pursue whichever degree program they ultimatelychoose. Second, the Advising Center assists new students who intend to reapply to competitiveadmission majors. Advisors work with these students in developing programs of study that meet theestablished criteria for admission into their chosen major. For both of these student populations, theUniversity Academic Advising Center serves as both the college and department, providing administrativeservices, dean's office services, and academic advising until the students enter a specific major.University StudiesUniversity Studies is a major but it is not a degree-granting program. University Studies offers astructured advising program that provides students with the necessary support and strategies toinvestigate and compare academic disciplines so that they can make informed decisions about thedegree programs they will pursue. Students can explore any major available at the university whilecompleting course requirements toward a baccalaureate degree. To ensure that students graduate in atimely manner, University Studies requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the timethey have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or haveattempted 72 hours.Explore Technology (XT)XT is a major but it is not a degree granting program. XT allows students to explore majors that arerelated to technology and adds technological skills to other existing majors. All students in XT will take theExploring Technology Pathways to Success course. This course will allow you to explore different majorsthat fit your skills and interests while preparing you for success at Virginia Tech. The course is part of theFirst Year Experience program and, best of all, will be taught by your academic advisor. To ensure thatstudents graduate in a timely manner, XT requires all students to enter a specific degree program by thetime they have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) orhave attempted 72 hours.Restricted MajorsUniversity Studies and Explore Technology students can pursue any major offered at the university;however, students should be aware that some majors are competitive for internal transfer. Theseprograms have established specific criteria and application procedures that students must fulfill in order tobe considered for internal transfer into the major. In general, these criteria require students todemonstrate proficiency in designated core courses and, for some programs, in introductory majorcourses before they are eligible to apply. University Studies and Explore Technology students enter andgraduate from these restricted programs each year; however, since there is no guarantee of acceptanceto these programs, students are encouraged to investigate alternative majors even as they prepare toenter a restricted program.Restricted Programs for Internal TransfersCollege of Agriculture and Life SciencesHuman Nutrition, Foods and ExerciseCollege of Architecture and Urban StudiesArchitectureArt and Art History - Visual Communication (Graphic) Design; Studio ArtCreative TechnologiesIndustrial DesignInterior DesignLandscape ArchitectureMinor: Industrial DesignPamplin College of BusinessAccounting and Information SystemsBusiness Information TechnologyFinance, Ins. & Business LawHospitality and Tourism ManagementManagementMarketingMinor: BusinessCollege of EngineeringAll majorsAcademic advisors in the University Academic Advising Center are familiar with the internal transfercriteria and procedures for all restricted programs and will assist students in fulfilling these requirements.Pathways to General EducationAll undergraduate students at the university, regardless of their majors, are required to fulfill generaleducation course requirements in English, mathematics, science, social science, humanities, etc. There isa standard set of these courses, Pathways to General Education, which all degree programs incorporatein their graduation requirements.In general, General Education requirements are completed in the freshman and sophomore years. Somemajors are flexible with regard to which General Education courses can be used to fulfill degreerequirements; other majors designate specific General Education course selections. Academic advisorsassist University Studies and Explore Technology students in selecting courses that apply toward asmany of the majors a student is considering as possible. Thus, students fulfill degree requirements forgraduation while they are exploring majors and are usually able to graduate on time.Typical First Year ProgramFirst SemesterSecond SemesterFirst-Year WritingFirst-Year WritingMathematicsMathematicsNatural Science (lab-if required byintended major)Natural Science (lab-if required byintended major)Social ScienceSocial ScienceHumanities/ElectiveHumanities/Elective/Major SpecificCourseFor University Studies and Explore Technology students, as for most students at the university, the firstyear is primarily devoted to fulfilling Pathways to General Education requirements. Of course, UniversityStudies and Explore Technology students' programs of study vary depending upon the major or majorsthey are considering. Specific course selections are determined in individual consultation with anacademic advisor.Graduation RequirementsThe requirements to graduate in a specific major are determined by the department and collegeconferring the degree. In general, students are required to have a minimum 2.0 overall grade-pointaverage and a minimum 2.0 grade-point average in their major in order to graduate. The number of credithours required for a baccalaureate degree varies from 120 to 136 hours, depending upon a student'smajor and degree program.Honors CollegeThe freshman application to Virginia Tech automatically includes consideration for admission to theHonors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships.The Honors College does not consider minimum test scores. They look holistically at an applicant'sexperiences and consider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, se;f-awareness and reflectionon involvement, and authenticity.A student's application to Virginia Tech automatically serves as an application to the Honors College.There is no separate deadline to be considered for the Honors College.Dean's ListUniversity Academic Advising Center students who demonstrate academic excellence are named to theAcademic Dean's List and are awarded a Dean's List certificate. Students must be enrolled in a minimumof 12 graded hours (A-F) and must achieve a 3.4 GPA or higher in the fall or spring term to qualify.Pre-Professional AdvisingStudents who want to enter professional schools but who have not yet chosen an undergraduate majorwill find that the university offers a variety of degree programs that provide excellent preparation foradvanced training in professional fields. Though some professional programs, such as medicine, dentistry,and veterinary medicine, require students to complete a minimum number of credit hours at theundergraduate level in chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc., professional schools do not dictate thatstudents pursue specific undergraduate majors. A student can pursue almost any undergraduate degreeand be competitive for admission to a professional program.Global Education Office (Study Abroad)Opportunities to study at institutions in other countries are available to all qualified students, regardless oftheir major. Study abroad offers students a unique opportunity to learn about other cultures and peopleswhile earning college credit. Students who intend to participate in an overseas study experience shoulddiscuss their intentions with their advisor early in their academic career.© 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarPublication InformationPublication and Contractual InformationPolicy Statement on Sexual HarassmentPublication and Contractual InformationThe provisions of this catalog do not constitute a contract, expressed or implied, between any applicant orstudent and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

They design and develop new and better materials and products and processes for householdsand industries, from tiny semiconductors, to huge dams, to insuring drinking water is safe. Engineers areneeded across a broad spectrum of industry from the traditional fields such as mechanical to theemerging fields of robotics and biomedicine. Engineers must not only satisfy society's demand forimproved performance, reliability and safety of products, they also are expected to supply solutions forenvironmental and social problems created by new technology.Our graduates are well-rounded problem solvers with learned classroom knowledge and hands-onapplicable skills. Graduates with diverse perspectives trained in engineering will find many professionaloutlets. They may join large or small manufacturing industries or they may offer their skills and knowledgeas professional consultants. They may work in government or private research laboratories or teach anddo research in universities. If the future leads them into other professions such as medicine, law, foodservices, or business, their engineering education shall provide a sound base. Graduates of the Collegeof Engineering are in high demand. Our Student Engineers' Council-run Engineering EXPO — VirginiaTech's largest career fair and one of the largest student-run career fairs in the nation — brought inapproximately 291 employers in 2016. The Virginia Tech College of Engineering is a key recruiting schoolfor major national corporations and government agencies.It is essential that engineers, regardless of specialty, be well-versed in mathematics, the physicalsciences and the engineering sciences so that they can adapt readily to meet the profession's ever-changing demands. But professional training is not enough. Engineers need to have passion,imagination, and insight. They must understand the history and traditions of the society in which they live.They also must be familiar with the social sciences and humanities.Engineers also must be able to communicate effectively with higher management and the general public.All departments within the college have programs to ensure that every graduate is able to effectively usea variety of spoken, visual, and written communication strategies, which are necessary for success as astudent, for employment, and for life as a responsible citizen. Additionally, freshmen engineering classesemphasize the importance of communications in engineering analysis and design.Engineers who are well-educated, not just well-trained, will be better equipped to develop scientificknowledge into useful technology.College RankingsIn U.S. News & World Report's "America's Best Colleges 2017" survey, released in September 2016, theCollege of Engineering's undergraduate program ranked 16th among all undergraduate engineeringprograms that also offer doctoral degrees and eighth among public universities.

An educated person sees the present in connection with the past, andunderstands that presently prevailing values and meanings derive from the creative thought and action of menand women who have preceded us. A study of in uential texts, ideas, representative works of art andtechnology, and the development of cultural traditions begins to free the student from the super cial fads of themoment and from narrow provincialisms. By examining some of the enduring ideas about human nature andachievement past and present, the individual gains a greater degree of self- knowledge and is better able toformulate worthwhile aims and commitments.Courses in this curricular area take the human condition and human values as their main focus, while dealingwith a range of subject matters: philosophy, literature and communication, history, religion, the arts, andtechnology. Most of these courses deal with some aspect of Western cultural experience in its numerousvarieties. Relatively neglected dimensions of this experience such as the experience of women and minoritieswill be acknowledged and dealt with, both as an integral aspect of many existing courses and in separatecourses which focus directly upon these dimensions. The foreign language courses approved for Area 2explore the literatures of other countries in their cultural contexts. Moreover, since we are living in anincreasingly global cultural context, courses are included that introduce the student to formative non-Westernideas, arts, and traditions as well.Area 3: Society and Human Behavior6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses.Human beings are not only participants in the world of human culture; we are also observers of it. Thecultivation of systematic approaches to the study of humanity is one of the great achievements of the humanintellect. Every student should therefore be introduced to the sciences of society and human behavior, a goalthat can be accomplished through several avenues: through the study of psychology; through the study ofsocial structures such as government, family, community, or economy; or through more wide-rangingexamination of social patterns and processes. Such studies may examine past as well as present, non-Western as well as Western societies.Courses in this curricular area are best characterized by their methods of study and theoretical frameworks.They look for regularities in human behavior rather than giving primary attention to the unique or non-repeatable aspects of life. When varied human values and allegiances nevertheless make their appearancewithin these disciplines, they do so more as objects to be investigated than as commitments to be honored.Area 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery6 credit hours (2 courses) of lecture selected from approved CLE courses. Some majors require 2 credit hoursof related laboratory (2 labs).For many students at Virginia Tech, acquiring detailed knowledge of one or more of the natural sciences isessential. But for all students, a liberal education involves the study of what science is, of how it can beconducted, of what it can and cannot tell us about the world. Without scientific study and the experienceoffered by a laboratory, students perceive only vaguely how and why science functions as a crucial standardfor knowledge and inquiry in modern life. The study of a science engages the student in analysis anddeduction as well as empirical experimentation - that is, in scientific reasoning and discovery.The impact of the natural sciences and technology on our globally interdependent world is one of the mostimportant realities we face as we enter the 21st century. The science courses in the CLE have a special rolein educating students about the critical relevance of scientific knowledge to the potentialities and dilemmas ofour natural and social environments.Area 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE coursesLike writing, mathematics is essential to intellectual inquiry in many areas. It is a basic language of the naturaland social sciences and has become a useful tool for research in the humanities. The technological uses ofmathematics and related forms of symbolic analysis are of tremendous significance to human society.Furthermore, the history of quantitative and symbolic reasoning as an intellectual discipline is linked withphilosophy, the arts, and other aspects of human culture. Thus, a broad education must include these forms ofreasoning, both as skills and as central modes of thought. Mathematics, statistics, and certain areas ofcomputer science and philosophy can all contribute to broadening a student's knowledge of quantitative andsymbolic reasoning.A diagnostic formula and testing procedure has been derived to predict readiness for Engineering/ScienceCalculus at Virginia Tech.

The College operates three campuses, including the maincampus facilities at Virginia Tech, the Avrum Gudelsky Veterinary Center at College Park, and the MarionduPont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg.Theus, S.

The goal ofthis program is to enhance the research capabilities of the graduates so that they can conductindependent research and associated societal endeavors aimed at solving biomedical problems related toveterinary medicine. These individuals will be expected to make scientific contributions in academia,research, and animal health administration.For additional information, contact the Graduate School via e-mail at vmsgrad@vt.edu.Professional ProgramStudents desiring admission to the four-year instructional program leading to the D.V.M. degree mustshow evidence of intellectual ability and achievement, as well as personal preparation for the curriculumand the profession. Because the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of spaces in enteringclasses, only those who demonstrate such qualifications to a high degree will be selected. Most enteringstudents will have completed three or more years at an accredited university by the time of matriculation;however, applications will be accepted from students who have completed at least 60 semester hours or90 quarter hours of university credit by the end of the spring term of the year for which application isbeing made, and who have a grade point average of at least 2.8 on a four-point scale. Exceptionalstudents with the minimum university course work are encouraged to apply.A number of college courses, with laboratory classes, are required for entry into the DVM programincluding biological sciences, organic chemistry, and physics. An 8-semester-hour or 12-quarter-hoursequence is required for each of these subjects. A one-semester course (3 semester hours) inbiochemistry will meet the minimum requirement for entry.Further courses required include 6 semester hours or 9 quarter hours of college-level courses in English,mathematics, and humanities/social sciences. In addition, many courses contributing to a well-roundedliberal education are of direct value and, although proficiency in the sciences is essential to theunderstanding of veterinary medicine, concentration on the sciences at the undergraduate level is notessential. Those students who elect to major in disciplines other than the biological sciences, chemistry,or physics may find less difficulty in coping with the basic sciences in veterinary medical school if theyhave, in addition to the above mentioned required courses, some work in either advanced biology oradvanced chemistry. Suggested electives include: medical terminology, biostatistics; cell biology,comparative anatomy, genetics, microbiology, nutrition, physiology, or domestic animal productioncourses. Since veterinary medicine also is concerned with a variety of social, environmental, andcommunity activities, a broad cultural background is important. Basic computer skills are highly desirable.Admissions inquiries should be directed to:Jacque Pelzer, D.V.M.Director of Admissions and Student ServicesMs. Shelby JenkinsAdmissions CoordinatorAdmissions OfficeVirginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary MedicineVirginia TechBlacksburg,  at VirginiaTech in the rst enrollment with a C- or better receive Advanced Standing credit for .

In addition to being beautiful, architecture is, by ancientdefinition, functional and durable. Like art, architecture is permeated by dualities. It is stable andtransitory, measurable and immeasurable, and capable of both being touched and touching us. Likescience, architecture involves systematic study. Its methods are iterative, experimental, and rely onintense observation. By intertwining the poetic and practical, architecture is uniquely poised to addressthe challenges of contemporary life and build the culture of the 21st century.The professional curriculum in architecture requires five years of study for the first professional degree,the Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch.).The first professional degree programs at Virginia Tech, the five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree (B.Arch.), the Master of Architecture II (M.Arch.2), and the Master of Architecture III (M.Arch.3) degrees, arefully accredited for the current maximum six-year term of accreditation by the National ArchitecturalAccrediting Board.All students in the School of Architecture + Design - Architecture, Industrial Design, Interior Design andLandscape Architecture - begin their studies in a common first year foundation program. Following thefoundation program, students pursue professional studies in the 2-3 and 4-5 programs.Foundation Design Program - First YearFoundation Design Lab is an immersive, interactive learning environment focused on inquiry,experimentation, discovery, and synthesis for students studying architecture, landscape architecture,interior design, and industrial design. The design lab develops self-reliance and self-critique, opensintellectual horizons, and challenges students to continually expand and deepen their aesthetic judgmentand critical understanding. Studies are undertaken in two and three dimensions across multiple scales.Professional Program - Second, Third, Fourth, and FifthYearsThe Professional Program employs design theory and processes to study the design of buildings.Students conduct an interactive investigation of architectural space, environmental forces, and buildingtechnology. Foundations of discipline-specific knowledge are progressively introduced, discussed, andexamined as they contribute to the complex totality of a work of architecture. Students explore natural andcultural forces as they relate to architecture through means of representation specific to the discipline.With architecture at the core, the program examines interdisciplinary sources such as art, science, andphilosophy for the purpose of establishing the content the discipline shares with other forms of knowledge.Concepts in the Professional Program are communicated through both traditional drawings and models,as well as through modern virtual tools and digital production. All coursework seeks to develop the abilityto conduct a professional written and verbal discourse. Further emphasis is placed on intellectualdiscipline, constructive dialogue, assertion of interest, and a self-motivated search for critical issues.The second year is characterized by an increase in the complexity of design exercises to foster a betterunderstanding of the interplay between situation, time and desired spatial definition. Architecturalconstructs of smaller scales build on knowledge of basic design principles studied in the first year. Thelaboratory discourse focuses on principal elements of architecture and their compositional and materialrole in space. Architecture as the art of building is conveyed through the detailed study of exemplary builtworks.The third year provides for study of fundamental design principles, technical concepts and theirapplications, including measures of quality in architecture. The instructional content of this year articulatesand communicates to students the unique nature of architecture through the study of interrelationships ofmaterial, construction systems, site, and building programs. The Architecture III design laboratory guidesthe student's growing experience with practical design problems and provides order to the gradualexploration and learning of the nature and means of achieving architecture. Associated with ArchitectureIll are lectures, presentations, and workshops intended to challenge students toward sensible integrationof necessary systems and legal responsibilities in the design and construction of buildings.The fourth year builds on the increased comprehension of building systems acquired during the thirdyear. On-campus or off-campus, the aim of the various program options is to promote an in-depthunderstanding of the relationship between architectural idea and physical building form. On-campusstudents are offered studio courses with various focus topics. Off-campus options include several VT andnon-VT Study Abroad Programs, the Extern Program, the Washington-Alexandria Center, or the ChicagoStudio.Off-campus programs directed by the Virginia Tech School of Architecture + Design include:The Europe Study Abroad Fall Travel Program studies seminal European historic and contemporaryarchitectural works and urban spaces, which are visited and documented with analytical drawings,sketches, and photographs, supplemented by on-site lectures by architects and professionals.Documented research before and after the program leads students to greater depth ofunderstanding of the issues surrounding the architecture.The Steger Center Residency Program: Each semester, 16 architecture students take part in thisprogram at Virginia Tech's European Steger Center for International Scholarship in Riva San Vitale,Switzerland. An 18th century villa and its gardens on the southern tip of Lake Lugano provideresidence and dining facilities for Architecture + Design students, as well as 30 Virginia Techstudents from other academic disciplines. Studio work, courses, research, and travel are directed toadvance first-hand knowledge of the architecture, geography, and culture of Europe.The Chicago Studio: Hosted by significant architecture firms in downtown Chicago, this 4th-year off-campus semester seeks to integrate education and practice in a direct way. Its distinctive structureand curriculum is centered around urban focused studio and course work, with direct input from theprofession. Site visits in the Chicago metropolitan area and the lectures and events of the activearchitecture culture of Chicago contribute significantly to this program.Professional Extern Program allows students to spend one semester in an approved professionalsetting and receive up to 12 hours of academic credit. This program provides a valuable linkbetween the academic environment and architectural practices, discipline-related governmentagencies, and other design offices throughout the world.The Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center affords students from the School of Architecture +Design and from related College disciplines the opportunity to study with students and faculty from anational and international consortium of schools in the historic urban context of Old TownAlexandria. The Center complex offers studio space, classrooms, exhibition and review spaces,shops, and computer labs for the students and faculty of the consortium. The University also offersa limited number of apartments for students studying at the Center.In the fifth year, students conduct a yearlong advanced study with individual faculty advisors. The in-depth engagement with research, theory, and design is intended to broaden a student's expertise in aparticular area within the field of architecture. Fifth-year students are expected to formulate andaccomplish advanced high-level work in the form of a terminal project. Working with their advisors,students develop and discuss their research and design progress, and have periodic formal peer reviewsthroughout the year. Students are required to leave the project documentation of their 5th-year work withthe school upon graduation.The first professional degree programs (B.Arch., M.Arch.2 & M.Arch.3) in architecture are accredited bythe National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accreditedprofessional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural AccreditingBoard (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programsin architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master ofArchitecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-yearterm of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educationalstandards.Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre-professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earnedsequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degreeis not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.Next accreditation visit for all programs: 2018The four-year, pre-professional degree is not offered at Virginia Tech.Program RequirementsDegree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Graduation RequirementsUpon successful completion of program requirements of the foundation level of study and the professionallevels of study in architecture and with completion of 160 credit hours of study, a first professional degreeof Bachelor of Architecture is awarded.Satisfactory ProgressUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meetminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see "Academics")and toward the degree in Urban Affairs and Planning.Satisfactory progress requirements toward the degree can be found on the major checksheet by visitingthe University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (ARCH)1014: INTRODUCTION TO ARCHITECTURE: LESSONS IN FORM & CULTUREIntroduction to the discipline of architecture for non-architecture majors.

Faculty members in the department havechosen to specialize in selected areas of accounting or information systems and they teach and conductresearch in these areas. All faculty members at the professorial ranks have Ph.D.s in accounting orinformation systems appropriate to the courses they teach, and many have professional certification intheir areas of specialization. This faculty is committed to the education of accounting and informationsystems professionals who will be active participants in this information age, with increasing demand fordata analytics skills.The department's undergraduate program offers two options: Accounting (ACCT) and InformationSystems Audit (ISA). These options are designed to allow students to specialize in their area of interest.Completion of the selected option prepares the student for entry level positions as professionalaccountants or information systems professionals who work in professional service firms, industrialcompanies, governmental entities, or to continue their education in graduate school. The job titles varygreatly and include auditor, information systems auditor, management accountant, tax preparer, systemsconsultant, systems analyst, controller, financial data analytics specialist, and cost analyst. The demandfor our graduates has been strong throughout the department's history, and that demand is continuing.Many graduates of our department desire to gain certification in their selected area of specialization. TheCertified Public Accountant (CPA) is the best known of these certifications. Students taking the CPAexam in Virginia have to meet a 120-hour baccalaureate or higher degree requirement in order to sit forthe CPA exam, but must have 150 credit hours to be certified. The requirements for other states vary;however, most require students to meet the 150-hour educational requirement to be licensed. Studentsshould discuss with their advisor the several options Virginia Tech provides for meeting this requirementat both the undergraduate and graduate level. In addition to the CPA exam, graduates of our programssit for the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) exam, the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) exam,the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) exam, and others. Students planning to take one ofthese exams are advised to talk to their department's faculty during their junior year so that they mayselect the electives appropriate for the selected exam.The department encourages its students to gain "real world" experience prior to graduation through aninternship or by participating in the Cooperative Education Program. More information about theseprograms is available either from the department's faculty or Career Services. The department supportswinter internships for seniors who enroll in the 152-hour program.The department also encourages interaction with accounting and information systems professionalsby sponsoring three student organizations: Accounting Society; National Association of BlackAccountants; and Beta Alpha Psi, the national honorary and professional society dedicated to theadvancement of the accounting profession. These organizations and other campus groups providemultiple opportunities for developing leadership skills and interacting with accounting and informationsystems professionals.The department encourages students to gain a global perspective of business through modules oninternational issues in our courses, by participation in the college's International Business Minor and/or byparticipating in one or more of the college's study abroad programs. Our goal is to encourage ourstudents to become well-rounded professionals who will become leaders in their chosen careers.Lastly, many of the department's over 7,000 alumni have generously contributed to a variety ofscholarships for accounting and information systems majors. Each year the department awards over$300,000 in scholarships to our students.Course RequirementsStudents graduating from the Department of Accounting and Information Systems must have a minimumquality credit average (GPA) of 2.00 in upper-division (3000 and 4000 level) accounting and informationsystems courses (the in-major GPA) as well as an overall GPA of 2.00 for all courses taken at VirginiaTech.During their sophomore year, students must select one of the two options in the department: Accounting(ACCT) and Information Systems Audit (ISA). These options are more fully described below.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

CookAssociate Professor: S. CookAssistant Professor: N. CopelandA program in the Department of Sociology, we offer several courses and a minor in American IndianStudies.We believe that any successful American Indian Studies program must do more than simply educate ageneral student body on American Indian cultures and issues in a sensitive way. We believe that ourcurricula must exist in conjunction with all university programs pertinent to American Indians, and mustdepend on the impetus of indigenous peoples working within and beyond the university.In keeping with Virginia Tech's status and mission as a land grant institution, we strive to serve ourindigenous constituency, both as educators and as partners. Accordingly, our program serves as a vitalconduit for university-tribal relations, the recruitment and retention of American Indian students andfaculty, and Service-Learning initiatives in indigenous communities. Although our program has a regionalfocus, we offer a wide spectrum of courses--ranging from American Indian Literatures, American IndianSpirituality, and American Indian Arts, to native Peoples of the Southeast, American Indians in Film, andGlobal indigenous Rights--reflecting the impressive and diverse expertise of our faculty.In short, we embrace a holistic, collaborative approach to American Indian Studies in which universityfaculty and students develop and maintain meaningful partnerships. Accordingly, we maintain a tribaladvisory board consisting of elders and leaders from all of Virginia's eight Indian Nations. We regardthese representatives, and ultimately, all indigenous peoples as our colleagues.Women's and Gender Studies ProgramDirector: Sharon P. JohnsonProfessors: N. M. KingAssociate Professors: C.

Many ofthe course requirements for these degrees are common, because the two curricula share a broad rangeof common interests. Both programs offer a wide range of technical electives. Students with an interest inboth majors may enroll in a double major program.The objectives of both of the department's programs include the preparation of students for entry-levelpositions and graduate study in the fields of aerospace engineering and ocean engineering. Thedepartment seeks to provide students with a strong background in fundamentals, including theoretical,experimental, and computational aspects of science and engineering, which will facilitate lifelong learningand the ability to pursue advanced study. It also seeks to provide students with a broad education in theaerospace and ocean vehicle fields encompassing fluid dynamics, vehicle dynamics and control,propulsion, and structures, and including an emphasis on design and synthesis in a team environment.The department's curricula are vehicle oriented, with an emphasis on aircraft and spacecraft in theaerospace program and on ships of all types in the ocean engineering program. The department'ssystems engineering approach to these technologies makes them increasingly applicable to other fields,such as the automobile industry, high-speed train design, and other transportation related areas.Departmental graduates find positions in these fields, as well as with the aerospace industry, NASA, theDepartment of Defense, the ship building industry, and maritime agencies. Employers range from large,multinational corporations to small consulting firms.Classroom studies employ modern computational techniques. Laboratory classes use the department'soutstanding experimental facilities which include a large, research-quality subsonic wind tunnel with atwenty-four-foot-long, six-by-six foot cross section test area and state of the art automated control anddata collection systems, a 100-foot-long towing tank, a Mach 4 supersonic wind tunnel, a Mach 7hypersonic wind tunnel, a water tunnel, a 300-foot long asphalt runway, and several other facilities.The department encourages students to seek internships and to participate in the Cooperative EducationProgram, which gives qualified students valuable industrial experience while working toward theirengineering degrees. The department's required design courses often include multidisciplinary projects.The Aerospace Engineering and Ocean Engineering programs are accredited by the EngineeringAccreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. The department also offers programs of studyleading to M. Engr., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees.AOE students must meet all General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) requirements and onlycertain "free" electives and courses designated as "P/F Only" may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Lists ofapproved electives including technical, math, Liberal Education, and other electives are available on thedepartment's web page: www.aoe.vt.edu/undergrad/undergrad-advising/index-undergrad-advising.html.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (AOE)2024: THIN-WALLED STRUCTURESBasic structural elements of stringer-stiffened thin-walled structures, forces, moments, stresses, anddeformation of segmented bars/beams, flexure stress and deflection of beams principal plane, plane ofbending and plane of loading for beams with asymmetric cross sections, stresses, and twist due totorsion, shear flow and shear center in open and closed stiffened thin-walled structures, stiffened multicellbeams, materials properties and selection.

Moneyis a critical component of the economic system and its flow is the sustaining force of the U.S. and globaleconomy. Therefore, in working with how governments, corporations, intermediaries, and householdsutilize their financial assets finance professionals are an integral part of how the economy perpetuates thestandard of living that we enjoy.Traditionally there are three separate but related fields within finance: 1) corporate financial managementor "business finance" which focuses on the internal decisions of companies to raise funds and invest incorporate assets; 2) investment management which focuses on the purchase and sale of stocks andbonds or their derivatives by individuals and institutions; and 3) financial services management, whichfocuses on the management and regulation of institutions and the role that financial institutions play in theeconomy.The undergraduate program in Finance meets the requirements of students who desire specializedcareers in financial management. Students gain expertise in both accounting and finance, essential forsuccess as a financial professional. The case-oriented focus of coursework requires students to applytheir knowledge and strengthen their oral and written communication skills. The department offersspecializations in (i) Corporate Financial Management, (ii) Investment Management and CFA© (CharteredFinancial Analyst), based on the CFA© curriculum as recognized and approved by the CFA Institute, (iii)Banking and Financial Institutions Management, (iv) Financial Accounting, and (v) CFP© CertificationEducation with approval of CFP Board of Standards. Students also have the opportunity to participate instudent management funds focused on investments in bonds (BASIS) and in stocks (SEED).The curriculum offers courses in finance, insurance, and business law, but a major only in finance.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

It resides in, and is organized as a division of, the College of Science'sAcademy of Integrated Science.Nanoscience, the fundamental study of materials and structures whose size is on the nanometer scale,lies at the very foundation of our world. A nanometer is simply a billionth of a meter, and a typical atom isabout 1/10th of a nanometer in size. At this length scale, atoms and molecules follow the laws ofquantum physics, and the processes of life (for example, DNA and proteins are naturally-occurringnanoscale materials) and the properties of materials emerge from them. Due to a combination of profoundtheoretical insights, advances in scientific instrumentation, and massive computing power, we are nowcapable of imaging and steering single atoms with unprecedented precision, opening a window toward aworld in which materials, chemical compounds, devices, and even small organisms can be built atom byDivision Leader: R.

Liberal Education provides students the opportunity for rigorous intellectual encounters with enduringhuman challenges and important contemporary problems, through wide-ranging exposure to multipledisciplines and ways of knowing.Through the study of the Sciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Histories, Languages and the Arts, the CLEis designed to foster and develop intellectual curiosity and critical thinking; strong analytic, communication,quantitative, and information literacy skills; the capacity for collaboration and creative problem solving; theability to synthesize and transfer knowledge; intercultural knowledge and understanding; and ethical reasoningand action. The CLE seeks to create the conditions for growing creative and intellectual engagement; civic,personal, and social responsibility; and lifelong learning.What Students Will GainA liberal education offers 21st century students the foundations of what they need to live and thrive as citizensin a globally engaged democracy, a knowledge-intensive economy, and a society where new ideas andunderstandings are essential to progress. The success of today's college students in their communities,workplaces, and across their lifetimes depends upon a complex and transferable set of skills and capacities. Intheir lives and in their careers, our students must be prepared to grasp complex problems, develop a globalperspective on the diversity of human experience and knowledge, respond to changing demands, andarticulate innovative responses and solutions. Today's students are very likely to change jobs and evencareers several times over the course of their lives; and certainly, their roles and responsibilities in theirfamilies and communities will change and evolve over their lifetimes as well.The breadth of a rigorous liberal education combined with the depth of specialized study in the student'sprimary academic discipline(s)--and evidenced in a demonstrated capacity to adapt and transfer knowledge,skills, and responsibilities to new settings and questions--is essential to the education of the whole student2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuand sets the stage for a lifetime of learning and growth.Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE) Areas of StudyBecause the Curriculum for Liberal Education is a "living curriculum," there will be some changes from year toyear. Courses added to the CLE offerings are generally available to students immediately after beingapproved. Some requirements of the CLE are phased in over a multi-year period. Thus, it is essential thatstudents continue to consult with their advisors. Please visit the CLE homepage athttp://www.cle.prov.vt.edu/ for more information, and for the Curriculum for Liberal Education Guides.Areas of StudyArea 1: Writing and Discourse6 Credit HoursArea 2: Ideas, Cultural Traditions, and Values6 Credit HoursArea 3: Society and Human Behavior6 Credit HoursArea 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery6 or 8 Credit HoursArea 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning6 Credit HoursArea 6: Creativity and Aesthetic Experience1 or 3 Credit HoursArea 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context3 Credit Hours**Students should consult with their advisors about specific college or departmental requirements in theseareas.Area 1: Writing and Discourse6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses. Students who entered the university prior toFall 2005 and maintain continuous enrollment until graduation must meet the previous Writing Intensive (WI)requirement.Area 1 requirements reflect the centrality of discourse in the larger intellectual community. Our first-yearwriting courses introduce students to the interrelated and shared modes of verbal communication that aredistinctive to college life - argument, interpretation, analysis, and metaphor - and whose various usagessubstantially delineate what it means to become broadly educated. These beginning courses should bethought of as the springboard for further writing and discourse throughout the undergraduate curriculum,especially in the disciplinary concentration.In order to enable students to meet the aims of both liberal education and of professional preparation, weinclude writing in many courses throughout the university, even if it may not be the main intellectual capacityemphasized in the course. Students are encouraged to seek out courses that offer frequent opportunities forwriting and related forms of discourse, both for the enhanced learning these courses can offer and for theirbene t in terms of professional preparation. Many courses in the Curriculum for Liberal Education build uponthe writing and oral skills that are the direct goal of Area 1 by including a significant writing component and byencouraging the achievement of excellence in communicating ideas and knowledge.Formerly, the CLE required writing-intensive (WI) courses to support the development of students' writingskills across the undergraduate career. To better facilitate and broaden this goal, the requirement evolved intoa departmental requirement for Visual, Spoken and Written Expression (ViEWS). Development of thesecompetencies may be fostered through specific courses in the major, courses outside the major, and/orpreviously designated WI courses.Students may meet the first-year writing requirement in one of three ways:By successful completion of the two-semester sequence, ) for 2005; 2005, ,  or MAT H 1526 or MATH2015 or : Calculus of a Single Variable(4)).

Thiscurriculum exposes students to the fundamentals of the discipline: genetics, cell and molecular biology,evolutionary biology, and ecology. In addition, Biological Sciences majors may take advantage of electivecourses on topics such as macromolecular structure, pathogenic bacteriology, cancer biology, infectiousdisease ecology, human genetics, and global change ecology. Students may choose to complete anoption in one of the following three areas: Biomedical; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB); or BiologyEducation.The B.S. in Microbiology program provides majors with a more focused education in the biology and rolesof microscopic life forms present in our environments. The laboratory-intensive curriculum providesknowledge in the genetics and physiology common to all microbes and allows students to explore specificinterests with a broad range of advanced electives such as pathogenic bacteriology, immunology,environmental microbiology, food microbiology, virology, microbial forensics, and bioinformatics.Modern biology increasingly relies on knowledge, skills, and perspectives associated with other scientificfields, particularly chemistry, mathematics, physics and statistics. Success in biological sciences-associated careers requires students to master the fundamentals of these cognate fields and to be able toapply these skill sets.As a scientific discipline, biology is more than simple knowledge about living organisms. By integratingeducation and research, our majors are training to be leaders in their field who practice innovative andinterdisciplinary approaches in biological research. By participating in undergraduate research during theacademic year, our students are discovering through hands-on experience what it means to Invent theFuture. Our majors are strongly encouraged to explore internships and research opportunities on campusand elsewhere during the summer.The majority of our graduates continue on to advanced studies in the health professions or in variousbranches of the biological sciences. Graduates pursue professional degrees in medicine, dentistry,veterinary medicine, pharmacy, and nursing, or M.S. or Ph.D. degrees in ecology, environmental biology,microbiology, botany, zoology, cell biology, molecular biology, and biomedical sciences. Studentsinterested in entering the workforce are provided the core background for opportunities in biotechnology,food science, bioinformatics, bio-business, and health-related industries.Preparation for Advanced StudyGraduate StudyStudents who satisfactorily complete the undergraduate curriculum in biological sciences or microbiologymay pursue advanced studies leading to the M.S. or Ph.D. in various branches of the biological sciences.Those interested in teaching science are prepared to pursue the M.A.Ed.Preparation for MedicineThe training afforded by the first three years (approximately 96 hours) meets the pre-medical trainingrequirements of medical colleges that accept students with only three years of undergraduate work. It isstrongly recommended, however, that all students complete a B.S. before entering medical school.Preparation for DentistryDental colleges require a minimum of three years of college training for admission, but it is generallyadvisable for students to complete the B.S. before entering dental school.Preparation for Allied Health ProfessionsSchools of Allied Health Professions, such as nursing, pharmacy, medical technology, physical therapy,etc., require two or more years of college work for admission. Specific requirements are available fromCareer Services or the Biological Sciences Department.Preparation for Veterinary MedicineVeterinary schools require a minimum of three years of college training for admission. Few students whomeet only the minimum entrance requirements are accepted by veterinary schools.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula.

Thesecourses provide understanding of political systems, forms of government, international relations and otherpolitical processes throughout the world. Political science courses also offer preparation for careers ingovernment, business, nonprofit/nongovernemnt organizations, law, politics, and education.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.General Option for the B.A. DegreeThe general option encourages students to take courses in all of the subfields of political science,including political theory, comparative politics and government, U.S. politics and government, internationalrelations, and research methodologies and methods. This permits students to describe, analyze, andevaluate governments, public policies, and political processes, systems, and behaviors, locally, nationallyand globally. Students choosing this option pursue careers in government, nongovernmentalorganizations, business, education, law, policy analysis, and politics.Legal Studies Option for the B.A. DegreeThe Legal Studies option allows students to explore values, ideas, and reasoning linked to public law, itsdesign, and its impact, preparing them for law school, graduate work in public policy fields, and a rangeof endeavors in and outside of governments. The option is not intended to be a pre-law program,although students hoping to attend law school may enroll for the option and may well benefit from itsachievement.National Security Option for the B.A. DegreeThis option is intended to help students understand policy making in relation to the national security of theUnited States. Students are directed toward courses in foreign and military policy and the presidential andcongressional branches of U.S. government.Political Thought Option for the B. A. DegreeThis option directs attention to courses in the department that focus upon political thought and to coursesin other university departments that deal with ethical thought. This cross-disciplinary approach is designedto enable students to contextualize their study of political theory and ethics in a broad scholarlyframework.MinorsThe requirements to earn a minor in Political Science or in National Security and Foreign Affairs can befound on the specific checksheets available on the University Registrar's website.Students majoring or minoring in Political Science or in International Studies may not complete theNational Security and Foreign Affairs minor.Regarding Double MajorsThe Department of Political Science offers majors in both Political Science and International Studies.Courses for the majors overlap significantly. Therefore, students may not pursue a major in PoliticalScience and a major in International Studies simultaneously, nor major in one and minor in the other.AdvisingThe department provides advisors to help students understand and meet degree requirements. Careercounseling also is available in the department, as is advising for students interested in attending graduateor law school after graduation from Virginia Tech.InternshipsThe department arranges academic credit for internships in state, local, and federal governments,nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate settings. The department's internship program offersstudents a chance to gain career-related experience in a wide variety of organizations. Information onthese opportunities can be obtained from the internship director.Student OrganizationsTo provide opportunities for informal association of faculty and students, the department sponsors thePolitical Science Club; a chapter of Phi Alpha Delta, the pre-law honor society; a chapter of Pi SigmaAlpha, the national honor society in political science; and other student organizations such as ModelUnited Nations. Information about these activities, as well as about any other aspect of the department,may be obtained from the department chair, advisors, or the department office.Satisfactory ProgressUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meetminimum criteria toward the Curriculum for Liberal Education (see Academics chapter in this catalog),toward the department's general education requirements, and toward the degree in Political Science.Satisfactory progress toward the B.A. in political science requires completion of .

Sandridge2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewMechanics is a fundamental area of science and engineering. It is an exciting, expanding field of learningwith its roots grounded in the laws of motion formulated by Newton and the principles governing thebehavior of solids and fluids, branching out in modern times into interdisciplinary fields such as newengineering materials (adhesives, composites, polymers, light metals), biomechanics, transportation, windengineering, and vehicular structures.

Be sure to check withyour advisor about the requirements for your program.Area 6: Creativity and Aesthetic Experience1 or 3 credit hours selected from approved CLE courses. Students in the College of Science and most majorsin the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences must take one (1) 3-credit hour course. Students shouldconsult with their advisors about specific college or departmental requirements.The arts contribute significantly both to the experience and the interpretation of human life. Creativity andaesthetic response criss-cross the boundaries among intellectual ideas, the imagination, and actual design.Moreover, the arts are always intimately linked with the material culture of a society — its modes of productionand design — as well as with its values and ideas. Thus, the arts can be studied and experienced in a varietyof ways: as "high culture," as a means of tracing the history and ideas of particular societies, and as an activeprocess of creative design and expression in many different physical forms. The metaphorical and intuitivethought processes that are essential to making and experiencing works of art are woven into many otherhuman cultural and creative activities. Thus, the arts have an important role to play in broadening ouraesthetic and intellectual sensibilities. Most artistic media include a highly public dimension - concerts,exhibitions, performances, publications, public installations, and the built environment - in which the creativeworks of artists, designers, and their collaborators are accepted or contested as meaningful elements of thelarger social fabric. A guided exposure to the arts can provide a valuable framework for continued appreciationof, and participation in, the arts beyond college.Area 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context3 credit hours (1 course) selected from approved CLE courses.Global interdependence is a powerful fact of life as we enter the 21st century. The dilemmas and possibilitieshumankind faces cannot be effectively addressed by any single culture or group of people acting alone. Anawareness of critical issues of the day is thus an essential extension of liberal education and preparesstudents to respond thoughtfully to the complex world in which they live. As a state institution of highereducation, Virginia Tech has a responsibility to prepare students to react creatively and constructively to thesocial, international, intercultural, and environmental challenges that confront the Commonwealth and theworld.The university requires that undergraduates take at least one course that deals in a substantial way with majorissues of critical importance for the larger global society. Courses that satisfy this requirement can be taken inany area of the curriculum, including the major, the Curriculum for Liberal Education, or electives. Studentsmay select from a wide range of courses that focus on major international and intercultural issues incontemporary world affairs, including such areas as politics, the management of con ict, the roles of economiccompetition and cooperation, demographic issues, and the emerging world order. Many science courses inArea 7 examine global issues associated with environmental decline and restoration. Some engineeringcourses study the role of technology as a major force in shaping the cultural and economic conditions ofhuman societies. Other courses include comparative or cross-disciplinary examinations of cultures, societies,and belief systems, including those of developing countries. Other courses examine the social and personalimplications of cultural, racial, and gender-based differences. Whatever the topical focus of the course, allArea 7 courses utilize interdisciplinary approaches in which a number of relevant factors - historical, ethical,technological, cultural, and/or scientific - are brought to bear on the issues being studied.© 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the UniversityRegistrarComputational Modeling and Data AnalyticsOverviewBachelor of Science in Computational Modeling and Data AnalyticsSatisfactory ProgressComputer LiteracyUndergraduate Course Descriptions (CMDA)OverviewThe Computational Modeling and Data Analytics (CMDA) program is a joint effort of the departments ofMathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science.

The curriculum differs from other engineering programs in that itfocuses on the sustainable production of biological products and the management of natural resources.Biological Systems Engineering graduates have rewarding careers working with biological materials andboth large and small biological systems, for the benefit of society and the environment.The BSE program is designed to graduate biological systems engineers who will be leaders in applyingengineering principles to biological systems, preparing graduates to accomplish the following objectives intheir careers:design and implement systems that mimic or adapt natural biological processes to solve problemsHead: M. L. WolfeProfessors: J. R. Barone, B. L. Benham, R. D. Grisso, W. C. Hession, S. Mostaghimi, M.L. Wolfe, and C. ZhangAssociate Professors: J. Arogo Ogejo, Z. M. Easton, L.-A. H. Krometis, D.J.

MarigerWeb: www.bse.vt.edu2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenurelated to conservation and restoration of natural resources;design and implement processes to utilize biological materials for sustainable production of valuableproducts;promote stewardship of natural resources; andcontribute effectively as members of multidisciplinary groups that include scientists, engineers, andcommunity members.These educational objectives are supported by a curriculum that provides its graduates with:an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineeringan ability to design and conduct experiments as well as analyze and interpret dataan ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realisticconstraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety,manufacturability, and sustainabilityan ability to function on multidisciplinary teamsan ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problemsan understanding of professional and ethical responsibilityan ability to communicate effectivelythe broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in global andsocietal contexta recognition of need for, and ability to engage in lifelong learninga knowledge of contemporary issuesan ability to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practiceThe BSE program provides a strong, broad-based engineering education with opportunity forspecialization utilizing the 33 credits of technical electives available in the curriculum. Using theseelectives, BSE students prepare for careers in biomedical engineering, biotechnology,biopharmaceuticals, food engineering, or watershed science and engineering. Many BSE graduates alsochoose to pursue graduate studies or professional degrees from medical, veterinary, or dental programs.Recognizing the importance of "hands-on" experience in engineering education, instructional laboratoriesare included in many of the Biological Systems Engineering courses. These laboratory courses aredesigned to enhance understanding of theoretical concepts through hands-on activities. In addition toproviding a strong and broad-based engineering education, the program emphasizes communication,team work skills, and design experience. The department participates in the Cooperative EducationProgram, which gives qualified students valuable work experience while pursuing an undergraduatedegree. Students are also encouraged to participate in undergraduate research and study abroadprograms. Many BSE students are employed in departmental research laboratories.Design and teamwork experiences are integral parts of the program. In the second year, students work inteams to design, build, and test a solution to an assigned design problem. Throughout the junior year,students acquire knowledge and analytical skills required for successful and professional engineeringdesign through course assignments. The senior year design sequence gives students a comprehensivedesign experience in which they utilize much of the knowledge they have acquired through their othercourses. Students work in teams to solve "real-life" engineering problems.The Bachelor of Science in biological systems engineering is offered through the College of Engineeringand is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.The relatively small class sizes in Biological Systems Engineering promote excellent interaction betweenfaculty and students.The department offers over 20 endowed scholarships to students enrolled in Biological SystemsEngineering; students are also eligible for College of Engineering and other university scholarships.In addition to the undergraduate degree program, programs of study leading to master of engineering,Master of Science, and Ph.D. degrees are available in the department. The BSE department alsoparticipates in the Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate degree program. Through this program,undergraduate students with a GPA of 3.4 or above can apply for admission to the Graduate Schoolduring their junior year. If admitted, students may apply up to 12 hours of graduate coursework to boththeir graduate and undergraduate degree requirements, thus accelerating completion of a master'sdegree in BSE.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (BSE)2004: INTRODUCTION TO BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS ENGINEERINGIntroduction to the fundamental concepts of Biological Systems Engineering, including statistics, heat andmass balances, protein separation, microbial metabolism, and enzyme kinetics.

This body of knowledgeincludes the scientific procedures for formulating and testing theories and the procedures for applyingtheory to enhance welfare through engineering analysis, synthesis, and design. The civil engineer plays akey role in the design, construction, maintenance, and management of society's physical infrastructure,including transportation and communication systems, structural facilities for housing human activities,water resource management systems, natural resource development systems, and facilities andprograms for environmental protection. The Bachelor of Science program in Civil Engineering isaccredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.Web: www.cee.vt.eduEmphasis in civil engineering education is on fundamental principles of science and mathematics andtheir application to solving human problems. Civil engineering activities interact in many ways with thenatural and social environments within which they take place. Accordingly, the civil engineering programstrives to create an awareness of the ecological, social, economic, and political context of engineeringand attempts to prepare the civil engineer for the necessary interactions with other professions and thepublic. An effort to instill an understanding of the role of the civil engineer in satisfying total societal needsis an integral part of the civil engineering program.Consistent with the general program goal of facilitating development of student competence necessary forentry into engineering practice or graduate school, the Department has developed the following programobjectives:The educational objectives of the Civil Engineering undergraduate program are that, within a few years ofprogram completion, graduates should be effectively serving society as practicing civil engineers and inrelated capacities with a commitment to design, construction, and maintenance practices that willcontribute to sustainable development, provide for the continued well-being of spaces and infrastructure,and hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public. Additionally, the program's graduatesshould continue to grow both technically and professionally so that they develop into leaders within theirchosen fields of endeavor. Growth experiences could include activities such as professional licensure,graduate level education, self-directed study, and participation in professional society activities.The curriculum provides a common freshman and sophomore year, with selection of upper divisioncourses made during course request for the second semester of the sophomore year. The civilengineering curriculum provides breadth across the civil engineering profession and the opportunity fordepth within a student's selected specialty areas of interest. Specialty areas offered within the departmentinclude: construction engineering & management, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering,land development, civil engineering materials, structural engineering, transportation engineering, andwater resources engineering.Students are progressively exposed to civil engineering design, culminating in a focused design courseexperience. The projects assigned in design courses are open-ended, incorporate appropriateengineering standards, and require the application of knowledge from earlier courses in the curriculum.Projects apply technical knowledge to design appropriate physical facilities, but also include considerationof non-technical constraints that confront real-world projects. These additional considerations includesuch interdisciplinary issues as economics, environmental impact, and sustainability. Accordingly,teamwork and good professional communications skills are a significant part of each design projectcourse experience.Classroom instruction in the civil engineering program is reinforced by instructional laboratories in themajor areas of civil engineering practice. The department seeks to employ the latest educationaltechnology and innovative teaching methods.The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students mayalternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment. The department encourages allstudents to participate in professional work experience prior to graduation.Contact person for undergraduate Civil and Environmental Engineering programs is Kara Lattimer, CEEAcademic and Career Advisor at (540) 231-7148 or e-mail: karalatt@vt.edu.Full programs of graduate study are available, leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D. in civil engineering.Graduate degree programs concentrate in one of five major areas: construction engineering andmanagement, environmental and water resources engineering, geotechnical engineering, structuralengineering and materials, and transportation and infrastructure systems engineering. For details, see theGraduate Catalog.Civil Engineering ProgramAdmission to a degree program is competitive, with departmental restrictions established each year by thecollege. Entry into a degree-granting department requires that a student complete all first year requiredcourses and maintain a competitive GPA. Applicants who begin their freshman year in the College ofEngineering and earn a minimum 3.0 overall are guaranteed first choice of major.

For further information on these policies, please contactthe department.The chemical engineering curriculum integrates studies in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heattransfer, mass transfer, process control, reaction kinetics, plant and process design, verbal and writtencommunications, and reaction kinetics, along with professional ethics and environmental awareness.Throughout this curriculum students learn the elements of the design of chemical processes and chemicalprocessing equipment. In addition, students gain hands-on experience with the equipment during thesummer Unit Operations Laboratory. The experience culminates in participation in either a nationalsenior-level design contest or a design project with a local industrial mentor. The laboratory and thesenior design courses are recognized as two of the high points in the undergraduate program. Thecomputer is a necessary tool in all the courses and the same software used in industry is used in thedesign courses.In addition to the basic undergraduate program outlined here, more sophisticated and specializedprograms leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering also are offered (see GraduateCatalog).The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program whereby qualified students mayalternate periods of study with periods of professional employment.Chemical Engineering ProgramA total of 135 semester credits are required for graduation in 2019.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.The following are special focus areas students can use as electives.

Specialty areas within the mechanical engineering discipline include, among many others, acoustics,biomechanics, CAD, controls, energy conversion and energy management, HVAC, materials, mechanicaldesign, mechatronics, nuclear engineering, robotics and automation, and turbomachinery. The actual jobfunctions which mechanical engineers perform vary widely as well. ME's work in design, research anddevelopment, manufacturing, service and maintenance, as well as technical sales, in almost every industry.Many are in management and administration. Many mechanical engineering graduates go on to moreadvanced degrees, or continue their education in other fields, such a law or business.Employment OpportunitiesBecause of the diversity and breadth of the mechanical engineering profession, ME graduates findemployment in a wide variety of industries, laboratories, and consulting firms. This results in a relatively stablejob market that is not dependent upon a single particular industry. The textile, petroleum, chemical, electronic,automotive, aerospace, power generation, HVAC, and manufacturing industries hire large numbers ofmechanical engineering graduates and the starting salaries for ME's are very competitive with the otherengineering disciplines.Because of the wide diversity of specialties and job functions any two mechanical engineers might havesignificantly different day-to-day activities and responsibilities. Some may be concerned with very largeengineering systems while others are working with small and even microscale devices and components; somework might call for highly analytical or mathematical approaches while other work might be more amenable toexperimental or empirical approaches. Mechanical engineers may be involved in the operation of processingplants, or the design of engines, prosthetic devices, steam and gas turbines or compressors and pumps,alternative fuel devices, and many other devices and systems. At Virginia Tech there is a close associationbetween the ME departments research and design project activities with industry. This enhances theopportunities for student interaction with industry representatives.Mechanical Engineering Program Educational ObjectivesWithin a few years after graduating from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Virginia Tech, thegraduates will attain:Positions where they utilize fundamental technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, andengineering to analyze and solve problems, and apply these abilities to generate new knowledge, ideasor products in academia, industry or government.Practical experience and organizational skills, enabling them to interact and communicate effectivelyAssociate Professor of Practice: R.

In the senior capstone sequence students are required to apply classroomknowledge to complex engineering problems requiring teamwork, problem formulation, economic analysis,effective communication, and product realization. These projects are carefully selected and updated to ensurerelevancy to contemporary technical issues and needs. The department encourages the involvement ofunderclassmen and students outside the department and college in these projects. The department alsoencourages hands-on student involvement by providing dedicated machine and welding shops that exclusivelyserve the undergraduate program. The required sophomore-level Manufacturing Processes Laboratory courseand certification by a professional machinist are required prior to use of either of these shops. Opportunity forprofessional development is provided by participation in student professional organizations, such as theAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME, and the American Nuclear Society, ANS.The CurriculumA total of 131 semester credits are required for graduation. Please refer to the Registrar's website for officialprogram checksheets showing the graduation requirements and recommended course plans. A revised MEcurriculum is currently in preparation. Students should check the ME website or speak with one of the MEundergraduate advisers for the latest information regarding the proposed curriculum changes. For the currentlyapproved curriculum unofficial documents are available on the ME website showing prerequisite relationshipsto courses and alternative course plans (e.g. for co-op students and military 4.5 and 5-year plans).www.me.vt.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-program/current-students/course-selection/#requiredcoursesThe ME curriculum provides a strong foundation in the basic physical and chemical sciences and inmathematics. These are followed by a sequence of courses that provide a broad background in designmethodology, computer programming, electronics, solid and fluid mechanics, manufacturing processes, systemmodeling, machine design, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, statistics and materials. Courses inEnglish and in the humanities and social sciences are included to broaden the individual. This background isstrengthened and unified through a sequence of engineering design and laboratory courses. Instructionallaboratories in the junior and senior years provide opportunities for students to learn measurement andinstrumentation techniques. Students apply these skills to the acquisition and analysis of data from variousengineering systems.In all professional endeavors the mechanical engineer must consider ecological effects as well as theeconomic and social needs of people. The mechanical engineer must consider the conservation of naturalresources and the environmental impact in the design of systems. These considerations are included in anumber of ME courses and technical elective classes. Students wishing to further strengthen this area maywish to consider the Green Engineering Option at www.eng.vt.edu/green/index.php.The unifying activity in all aspects of mechanical engineering is the design function. A special emphasis hasbeen placed on the use of computer-aided design methods and applied design project experience as arequired part of the curriculum. Elective courses in the junior and senior years provide students with theopportunity to pursue specialized interests related to career plans or preparation for graduate study.The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may alternatesemesters of study with semesters of professional employment. Approximately twenty percent of allmechanical engineering students participate in this program.Education Abroad ProgramsThe Department of Mechanical Engineering is a world leader in providing high-quality education abroadopportunities to its students and preparing them to function effectively as true global engineers. Thecornerstone of this strategy is the Ultimate Global Engineer Program, which identifies three major windows ofopportunity for students to attend topflight mechanical engineering programs abroad and graduate on time.Students can select to participate in any combination of one, two, or even all three of these windows ofopportunity:Windows #1: Fall semester sophomore year in a country where the language of instruction is English.Currently students can attend the University of Melbourne, the top-ranked mechanical engineering program inAustralia.Windows #2: Rising junior summer in a country with a non-English language but where the language ofinstruction is English. Currently students can attend Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the top-ranked mechanicalengineering program in China. This program is particularly well suited for students that need to catch up ontheir course work, reduce their junior-year course load, or get ahead on their course work.Windows #3: Senior year abroad in a country with a non-English language but where the language ofinstruction is non-English. Currently students can attend the Technische Universität Darmstadt (TUD), the top-ranked mechanical engineering program in Germany. Language training is integrated into the curriculum,starting as late as spring semester junior year.For more information about these and other exiting education abroad programs offered by the Department ofMechanical Engineering, please visit:http://www.me.vt.edu/internationalhttp://www.tud.vt.edu/BSEntrance RequirementThe College of Engineering at Virginia Tech limits the number of students who may transfer into any particulardepartment, with that number based upon the number of faculty in each separate department. Refer to theEngineering Education website at www.enge.vt.edu for the latest information on transferring into the MEdepartment. The ME academic advisor may also be consulted for information on anticipated entrancerequirement changes.Satisfactory ProgressUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimumcriteria toward the Curriculum for Liberal Education (recently replaced with Pathways General EducationCurriculum), and toward the degree in mechanical engineering.Satisfactory progress toward a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering includes the following minimum criteria:Complete a minimum of 12 credits that apply toward the BSME each yearmaintain an in-major GPA (all ME and NSEG courses) of at least a 2.0maintain an extended in-major GPA of at least 2.0 (in all ME, NSEG courses plus .

Conner, N. Sowder, S. Stinson, and J. WoollyWeb: www.liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-communication.html2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewThe majors in communication, leading to a B.A., allow students to develop a broad understanding of thediscipline and specific expertise in Communication Studies, Multimedia Journalism, or Public Relations.The Department of Communication focuses on strategic, theoretical, and practical application of messagecreation, delivery, analysis, and criticism in cultural and historical contexts.Students in communication majors are prepared to continue their studies in graduate school orimmediately apply their skills in various professional settings because of the broad applicability of both thetheory to which they are exposed and the competencies they develop. Rooted in a strong liberal artscurriculum, these majors prepare students to enter careers in mass media, business, public service,government, or professional specializations, such as law.MajorsStudents choose one of three majors in communication to specialize in the discipline: CommunicationStudies, Multimedia Journalism, and Public Relations. Multimedia Journalism offers a concentration inSports Media and Analytics.Communication Studies (CMST) - This major develops human-interaction strategies and skills for face-to-face, public, and organizational contexts relating to decision making, influence, and informationexchange. As a graduate, you might consider careers in business, health, civic engagement, publicopinion, law, education, and ministry.Public Relations (PR) - This major emphasizes both skill and management functions of public relationsthrough theoretical and practical applications. Public relations spans media, organizational, corporate,and political contexts and includes investigation and analysis of public relations situations (e.g., crises,successes), message production and campaign planning, writing and presentation, and evaluation ofpublic relations strategies. Public relations permeates many areas of corporate, non-profit, and politicalwork, so this major provides students a foundation for many different career paths.Multimedia Journalism (MJ) - This major prepares students for news careers at newspapers,magazines, broadcast and cable outlets, and new media operations. The lines that separate thesespecialties are blurring as media convergence becomes more the norm. Courses provide both practicalskills and theory as they address history, law and ethics, current controversies and opportunities in thechanging news media.Sports Media and Analytics (Concentration) - This concentration enables students to complete the MJcurriculum while specializing in Sports Media and Analytics. In addition to mastering the content and skillsof MJ, you will participate in the production and delivery of sports news, consider ways to promote thesports industry with your study of public relations, and analyze data related to sports accomplishments,fan participation, and social media. The employment opportunities are myriad and include sportsreporting, public relations for sports venues, teams, and/or athletes, and promotional work for businessesthat support the fans.Major RequirementsThe curriculum is designed to provide foundational and development courses along with major-specificstudy. Students are introduced to concepts early in the undergraduate career, and the curriculum allowsthem to build knowledge and skills as they work on increasingly complex tasks. Students develop skills inwritten, spoken, and visual communication across their studies in the major. At the foundational level,students in every major are required to take the same introductory courses.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When you consider informationabout the degree requirements, always choose the year of your expected graduation. Requirements forgraduation are listed on checksheets. The number of credit hours required for degree completion variesamong curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations fordegree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Minor RequirementsThe department offers a minor in strategic communication. This multidisciplinary minor is open to majorsfrom across the university and is especially appropriate for students in business or science, technology,engineering, and mathematics disciplines. Coursework allows students to learn how strategiccommunication works in a variety of industries and prepare for the 21st century workforce. Few jobs haveno communication components.The minor curriculum introduces students to strategic communication through a four-course introductoryexperience. It covers basic communication skills, public relations, design, and accounting. Introductorycoursework requires students to integrate multiple areas of learning such as discourse, quantitative andcomputational thinking, reasoning in the social sciences, critique and practice in design and the arts,international and cultural awareness, and understanding ethical issues. Two advanced courses enablestudents to focus on particular issues in strategic communication, such as issues management, corporatesocial responsibility, or communication law. A capstone course lets students synthesize and analyzetopics and issues they explored in the four foundational and two advanced courses.Specific course requirements for the 18-hour strategic communication minor are explained on achecksheet.Satisfactory Progress Toward the DegreeUniversity policy requires that students demonstrate their progress toward the degree by meetingminimum requirements. A student will be certified as making satisfactory progress toward a degree bymeeting the following requirements:Completion of "
COMM 1014," within the first six classes (18 hours) in the majorCompletion of "
COMM 2124," within the first eight classes (24 hours) in the majorOverall GPA: 2.0COMM GPA: 2.0Students who fall below the standard for either the overall GPA or the COMM GPA will have onesemester to regain the required GPA standards. A student who fails to make satisfactory progress towarddegree after that semester will be blocked from continuing in any communication major.Freshmen and External Transfers into CommunicationIncoming freshmen and students enrolled at other institutions should follow directions for application asshown on the Admissions website.Internal Transfers into CommunicationStudents enrolled in other Virginia Tech majors who wish to transfer into Communication may use theonline system for application.Departmental Website and ContactPlease see the Departmental Website for more information about majors and the minor:www.liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-communication.html Contact: comm@vt.eduUndergraduate Course Descriptions (COMM)1004: FIRST-SEMESTER EXPERIENCE IN COMMUNICATIONIntroduction to areas of research, ethical behaviors, and career paths in the discipline.

We offer a challenging yetflexible curriculum that can be individualized to meet the educational needs and interests of each student,counseling to assist each student in designing individual programs, and extracurricular activities toenhance development of interpersonal skills.Students may select from three curricula: Dairy Business Management, Science/Pre-Veterinary, and DualEmphasis. All options provide students with the opportunity to acquire a broad education in the sciences,social sciences, economics, mathematics, and communications while learning the basic principles of dairyenterprise management.Dairy Business Management Option (DBM)This is the most flexible curriculum, with at least 30 credits of electives. Suited to students with an interestin various fields of dairy production (herd manager, farm manager), allied agri-business industries (feed,genetics, equipment), agricultural communications, public relations, extension, breed fieldperson, and avariety of other positions. Graduates in this option have also gone on to careers in college instruction,elementary school instruction, bank investment management, feed sales, and milk marketing, to name afew.Science/Pre-Vet Option (SPV)This option is recommended for students who plan to continue into veterinary college or other graduate orprofessional schools, or who plan a career in quality control, laboratory work, or research and productdevelopment. It provides an excellent base in chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology and biochemistryfor advanced study in many areas.Dual Emphasis Option (DUAL)This is the most popular option and is recommended for students who plan to concentrate in more thanone academic area as they prepare for future careers. Common minors and double majors that studentsmay earn while completing their Dairy Science degree requirements include Agricultural Economics,Animal and Poultry Sciences, Biology, Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences, Spanish, Communications,Professional Writing, etc.Opportunities to ExcelNearly all Dairy Science students complete a second major or minor in Animal and Poultry Science,Agricultural Economics, Horticulture, Spanish, Business Communications, Food Science and Technology,or any of many other departments. Students are also encouraged to actively participate in extracurricularclubs, judging teams and the dairy management team. Ninety five percent of students complete at leaston internship prior to graduation and nearly half complete undergraduate research, an independent study,or serve as a teaching assistant.Active participation in research projects in lactation, genetics, nutrition, nutrient management, andmanagement provide qualified students valuable research experience with departmental scientists as wellas part-time employment opportunities. These opportunities are available to students in all options andenhance their preparation for advanced study and provide a better understanding of the research process.The dairy science honors program offers outstanding students the opportunity to enrich and broaden theiracademic programs. Honors students work closely with individual faculty members in choosing honorsclasses, colloquia, independent study, and research projects. Graduation "in honors" requires successfulcompletion of university honors requirements, a comprehensive oral examination, and an honors thesis.Graduate programs of study leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. also are offered (see Graduate Catalog).Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Requirements for a MinorRequirements include ) and CSES/.

Williams, Yang(Cindy) Yi, H. Zeng, W.2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewThe Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers bachelor of science degrees inelectrical engineering (EE) and computer engineering (CPE). The difference between these two degreesis one of emphasis. Electrical engineering concentrates on physical processes and design incommunications and networking; energy and power electronics systems; controls, robotics, andautonomy; micro- and nanoelectronics; space systems; RF and microwaves; and photonics. Computerengineering emphasizes the development of computer hardware and associated technical areas, such asnetworks and cybersecurity; machine learning; chip-scale integration; controls, robotics and autonomy;and software systems. In addition to undergraduate degrees, the department also offers M.S., M.Eng.,and Ph.D. programs in both EE and CPE. An accelerated undergraduate/graduate (UG/G) program isavailable for qualified undergraduates.Electrical engineers (EEs) and computer engineers (CPEs) create important and exciting technologies,systems and applications that make the world a better place for all of us. EEs and CPEs are inventingnew ways to generate, distribute and use electric power that are more efficient, more sustainable andfriendlier to the environment. For example, wider use of solar energy relies on improved photovoltaicdevices, power electronics for energy conversion, and power grids. Some of our most critical globalinfrastructures, including the Internet, mobile voice and data networks, and the electric power grid aredesigned by EEs and CPEs. And, EEs and CPEs design sensors and embedded systems to monitorintelligent buildings and transportation systems. Applying innovative technologies to biology and thehealthcare industry, EEs and CPEs create techniques for medical imaging, micro-electromechanicalsystems for medical diagnostics, implantable devices for health monitoring and drug delivery, andinformation systems to improve healthcare delivery. To meet the challenge of cybersecurity, EEs andCPEs design hardware and software for cryptographic algorithms and develop methods to ensure privatecommunications through the Internet and wireless devices. They design new devices and systems forhigh-performance computing and networking. They build satellites and instruments to improvecommunications and enhance our knowledge of space and the Earth. And, EEs and CPEs enhance ourleisure time by creating new ways to listen to music, watch movies, play games, communicate withfriends, and build social networks.Students in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering learn from faculty who workat the cutting-edge of engineering research and bring the excitement of their discoveries to theclassroom. Engineers want to make things that work. EE and CPE students get hands-on opportunities tobuild components and systems from the beginning of their studies. In the freshman year, students exploreapplications of electrical and computer engineering, such as medical imaging and cryptography. In thesophomore year, EE and CPE students use personal, portable equipment and components to build andexplore simple digital and analog electronic systems, which become more complex each semester.Laboratories and team projects throughout the curriculum contribute to an enriching hands-on, minds-onlearning experience. By their senior year, students have the option of participating in a team-based,industry-sponsored design project that spans two semesters in which they solve real-world engineeringproblems while learning project management and team-building skills.Electrical engineering and computer engineering are dynamic and fast changing fields that driveZhou, Yizheng Zhu, and Yunhui ZhuAssistant Professor of PracticeL P.

The ECE faculty has created a program of study thatprovides each graduate with a firm foundation in mathematics, physics, and engineering principles, andwith broad experience in different areas of EE and CPE. The program enables our graduates to excel intheir EE and CPE specialties, while gaining the tools to adapt to the technical changes and careeropportunities they will experience in the future. EE and CPE students develop effective communicationand teamwork skills and gain knowledge of ethics, all of which are essential to professional success. EEand CPE graduates are prepared to pursue careers in industry and government, advanced graduate workin EE and CPE, and other advanced professional degrees.ECE seeks to develop tomorrow's engineering and technical leaders and innovators. Students canenhance their undergraduate experience by participating in multidisciplinary team projects, cooperativeeducation and internships, research experiences for undergraduates, study abroad programs, dual degreeand minor programs in other fields, and mentoring programs. The Cooperative Education (co-op) andInternship Program is highly recommended, as is participation in professional societies, including theInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) and the Association forComputing Machinery (ACM). ECE works with the Ted and Karyn Hume Center for National Security andTechnology to develop future leaders for the US government. ECE offers many scholarships for academicexcellence, leadership and service, as well as for participation in various special academic programs.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula.

Experimentalopportunities are available in such fields as fundamental particle physics, nuclear physics, condensedmatter physics, laser optics, and astronomy. Students are encouraged to participate with faculty membersin undergraduate research projects.Liberal emphases in the physics curriculum permit students to give special attention to those aspects ofthe discipline they prefer and enable them either to pursue a traditional course of study as preparation forjoining the technical staffs of industries or government laboratories, or for graduate studies in physics orastronomy (B.S.); or to pursue an interdisciplinary course of study with a strong background in physics(B.A.).A handbook that includes sample curricula for emphases in astrophysics, biophysics, chemistry, computerscience, education, electrical engineering, finance, geophysics, materials science, mathematics, physicseducation, pre-health, and pre-law is available from the department on request.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.MajorsPhysics B.S.

Through EngE courses, first-year students participate in problem solving, engineering analysisand design exercises that represent the essence of the engineering profession. The courses emphasize team-based, design-oriented, hands-on experiences to develop students' concepts of engineering and engineeringmethods, while reinforcing the role of concurrent required courses (e.g. mathematics, English, physics). Theyalso serve as a foundation for subsequent courses in the various engineering curricula. Coverage ofengineering ethics instills a sense of the responsibilities of engineers to society. Algorithm development andcomputer programming develop logical thinking, provide the background for computer use in later courses,and support problem-solving skills. Spatial visualization skills are developed through engineering graphics, aprimary engineering tool. Through writing and presentations, students begin to hone their professionalcommunication skills, including audience analysis, visual rhetoric, effective writing styles, issues incollaborative writing, techniques of oral presentation, print and Web-based research, graphics for written andoral presentations, and editing.All College of Engineering students must own 1) a convertible tablet PC or laptop running Windows 10meeting current specifications, and 2) stipulated software used to analyze and solve problems in and out ofclass. Computer requirements for engineering students can be located at www.eng.vt.edu/it/requirement.Process for Declaring a Degree-Granting Engineering MajorEntering students are admitted to General Engineering, the first-year program for all engineering curricula.The program introduces students to foundational concepts and practices in engineering, allows time to adjustto the College, and provides opportunities to investigate the College's individual degree programs and selectthe branch of engineering or computer science best suited to their skills and interests. At the end of the year -after academic advising, contacts with the various departments, and satisfactory progress - students select adegree program and, if academically eligible, are transferred to the appropriate degree-granting department.Entry into a degree-granting engineering department requires that students successfully complete all requiredfirst-year courses. Students must also earn a minimum grade of C- in "

A degree in English willappeal to students who are interested in a foundational education in the liberal arts, specializing inliterature and writing, and who may pursue careers in business, government, education, law, speechsciences, writing, publishing, advertising, health, activism, the arts, or social services.The Department of English also offers minors in Literature, Language Sciences, Professional andTechnical Writing, and Creative Writing, and many of its courses provide credits for Pathways generaleducation in Discourse, Critical Thinking in the Humanities, Critique and Practice in Design and the Arts,and Critical Analysis of Equity and Identity in the U.S.English Degree MajorsStudents working towards the B.A. in English may choose from three majors, each consisting of 39required hours.A major in EnglishWithin the English major, there are three options available to students: Literature, Pre-Education,and Pre-Law.A major in Professional and Technical Writing.A major in Creative Writing.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". Students must satisfactorilycomplete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.All three of the majors share a common English core that provides a foundational curriculum in research,critical thinking, and interpretation. Students in all three majors take these core courses together,providing a rich and diverse context for the study of writing and literature. The core requirements andspecific major requirements can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrarwebsite at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.Satisfactory ProgressUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meetminimum criteria toward the General Education requirements (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see"Academics") and toward the degree in English.Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. in English can be found on the major checksheet byvisiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.Post Graduate StudyUndergraduate majors interested in pursuing advanced degrees (M.A., M.F.A., or Ph.D.) in Englishshould, with the assistance of their professors, mentors, and the department's academic advisor, carefullyplan their programs of study. Coverage across periods and genres is strongly recommended, as is agood reading knowledge of another language, for students planning to continue study for a master's ordoctoral degree. Getting to know professors and learning as much as possible about the professionalelements of the discipline provide excellent preparation for graduate work.Pathways General Education and EnglishPathways General Education requires a six hours of foundational Discourse credits and three hours ofadvanced or applied Discourse credits. English 1105 and 1106 fulfill the six foundational credits of thisPathways requirement. These courses share a focus on the rhetorical dimensions of writing, speaking,and visual communication. Many 2000-4000 level ENGL courses fulfill the advanced or appliedDiscourse credits, and can count toward students' majors and Pathways general education. The same istrue of most courses that fulfill Critical Thinking in the Humanities, Reasoning in the Social Sciences,Critique and Practice in Design and the Arts, and Critical Analysis of Identity and Equity in the U.S.;courses that meet one or more of these requirements can count for Pathways and major credit.Advanced Standing (AS): Some students are exempted from ): STARTUP: COMMERCIALIZATION OF INNOVATIONWork in interdisciplinary teams in an experiential environment replicating modern innovationenvironments.

The departmental teaching, research, and extension programs are closely coordinated withthose of other departments.Insects are important as agricultural, health, and aesthetic pests and as beneficial organisms which serve aspollinators, biological control agents for pest populations, and as components of natural ecosystems. Whileentomologists have only scratched the surface in the study of insects and related arthropods, their researchhas yielded great benefits to humankind. Examples include reductions in human diseases transmitted byinsects and the leadership shown by entomologists in the development of integrated pest managementprinciples and procedures.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (ENT)1084: CAREERS IN ENTOMOLOGYA comprehensive introduction of post-baccalaureate professional opportunities requiring knowledge ofentomology including agricultural, medical and public health; forest and natural ecosystems; education andoutreach; engineering and material science; biodiversity and evolution of arthropods.

Driven by the needs andwants of the consumer, marketing managers develop new products, assign effective price levels, createpromotional strategies, and develop the best distribution plans to guarantee that products reach the finalconsumer. Marketing also plays a crucial role in managing the efficient flow of goods and services frombusinesses to businesses. And managing marketing is growing even more exciting as technology and theinternet enable managers to stay in closer contact with their customers and better manage thisrelationship. Marketing by manufacturing firms is well-known. Service industries such as banking andhealth care, however, are increasingly relying on marketing to improve service quality and delivery. Non-profit organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity and the American Red Cross, also use marketing todeliver social goods and services. All of these organizations benefit when they are able to use marketingconcepts and tools to better understand their clients and design unique offerings that can meet theirclients' needs.The undergraduate program in marketing management is designed to offer the student a broad businesseducation with an emphasis on professional training for development of marketing strategies andmanaging marketing operations. Virginia Tech Marketing graduates pursue a range of careers. They takejobs in marketing management, sales, advertising, retailing, and consulting positions in companies smalland large. The curriculum is designed to provide core skills in marketing and to support this broad rangeof potential career interests.In addition to the undergraduate program, the faculty in marketing management offer a master's and adoctoral degree for those students interested in more technical positions, such as marketing research;more rapid promotion with certain employers; or positions in higher education.The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students mayalternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment.The Marketing Department currently offers three degree options: Marketing- no concentration, Marketing-Sales concentration, and Marketing- Digital Marketing Strategy Concentration. In addition to the major,Marketing offers minors in Professional Sales and Digital Marketing Strategy to non-Marketing majorswithin the College of Business only.The Professional Sales concentration and minor provide students with the knowledge and skillsnecessary to successfully enter the field of professional sales. Students will learn the necessaryknowledge and skills needed to compete successfully in the respective field.The Digital Marketing Strategy Concentration and minor provides students with the knowledge and skillsto enter Marketing and related fields with technical experience in Digital Product delivery and developing,analyzing, and enhancing firms' products on the web, mobile, and social networks.RequirementsDegree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

Specifically,the Department of Mining and Minerals Engineering seeks, as its educational objectives, to preparealumni within a few years of graduation to possess:the intellectual ability to critically assess and tackle any engineering problem they may encounter;the communication skills to communicate technical information to a variety of audiences includingtechnically trained supervisors and subordinates as well as non-technical members of the workforce and the general public;the leadership and team building skills to lead projects and function as entry-level managers as wellas work productively as members of a team;an understanding of the practical aspects of the mining industry and an appreciation for mining as abusiness; andan awareness of societal issues and how these issues affect their role as future professionalengineers working for the general benefit of society.The mining engineering curriculum utilizes the basic and engineering sciences to develop the variousareas of activity of the mining engineer: mineral exploration, evaluation, development, extraction, mineralprocessing, conservation, protection of the environment, and mineral economics. Course work in theseareas provides a unique background for engineering and management positions in industry andgovernment, as well as for continuation of specialized graduate studies.Intrinsic to the curriculum is the development of a meaningful, major engineering design experience thatbuilds upon the fundamental concepts of mathematics, basic sciences, the humanities and socialsciences, engineering topics, and communication skills. This design experience is stressed within themajor and grows with the development and progression of the student. Ethical, social, safety, economic,and environmental considerations are emphasized in the design experience throughout many courses,including the capstone senior design course. Finally, the major engineering design experience is a focalpoint of the mining engineering curriculum and is consistent with the objectives and goals of the program.The program has an emphasis on the application of computers to mining and minerals processingoperations. Furthermore, it exposes students to laboratory courses which focus on conductingexperiments, understanding the principles involved in each experiment, and analyzing and interpretingexperimental data. Information on the mission, goals, and curriculum of the program is continuouslyupdated on the departmental website.The Cooperative Education Program, as well as opportunities for financial support in the form ofscholarships, loans, awards, and summer employment, are available to undergraduate and graduatestudents. Graduate programs are available leading to the M.S., M. Eng., and Ph.D.The B.S. degree program in Mining Engineering is accredited by the Engineering AccreditationCommission of ABET, www.abet.org.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

Its theories and methods provide analytical techniques applicable to a wide range of questionssignificant to a broad spectrum of occupations. The geography major provides a balance between aneducation focusing on contemporary social, political, economic, and environmental issues and training inadvanced computer-based techniques.Human geography is concerned with the spatial dimensions of human existence, the economy, politics,and culture as well as the relationshsips between humans and their environments.Physical geographers study patterns of climate, landforms, vegetation, soils, water, and natural hazardsHead: T.W.

DeisingerWeb: www.geography.vt.edu2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuand particularly the processes that produce those patterns, including human-environment interactions.Geospatial science involves Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS),web services, and remote sensing. These technologies have led to significant advances in the ways inwhich geographic information is collected, mapped, analyzed, and integrated in database and decision-making systems. All students are exposed to these technologies as they are integral to working in thefield today regardless of specialization and topic of interest.Training in geography provides valuable, marketable skills that are in high demand in business,government, and education. Geography majors obtain employment in such diverse fields as geographicinformation systems, satellite imagery analysis, planning, transportation, market analysis, health careanalysis, cartography (map making), land and water management, recreation, and environmentalconservation. Our students and graduates have worked with county, state, and federal agencies, privtefirms, non-profit organizations, and international organizations. Employment opportunities are especiallystrong for students obtaining advanced training in geospatial computer techniques, which are used byboth human and physical geographers.Geography Major Degree RequirementsThe department offers courses in human geography, physical geography, and geospatial informationscience.

WattsWeb: www.geos.vt.eduE-mail: geosciences@vt.edu2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewGeosciences offer exciting opportunities for students with an interest in applying a full range of scienceand mathematical skills to understand the earth's properties and dynamic processes. This is a highlyinterdisciplinary program that applies physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics to understand andmanage all aspects of Earth and the environment. Geoscientists work everywhere in the world underalmost any condition as they search for earth resources, manage the environment and natural hazards,and supervise technical and business enterprises. For more information about exciting careers inGeosciences consult http://about.agu.org/ and www.agiweb.org/careers.html. The extensive scientificand mathematical skills of geoscientists, along with their broad field experience, allow them to pursuecareers in many related fields ranging from material science to technical management to scientificreporting.The internationally recognized faculty in Geosciences has developed four challenging options, describedbelow, that lead to a B.S. in Geosciences. Coursework emphasizes the acquisition and processing of fielddata beginning with a special course in field methods taken in the spring of the first year. The geologyoption requires, and the other options recommend, that the student participate in a six-week field camp.The B.S. in Geosciences provides pre-professional preparation that will allow students to continue theireducation in post graduate programs in science, law, and business.Earth systems and processes are enormously complicated and require a full range of intellectual skills todecipher and manage. Geoscientists must possess good quantitative skills and a solid understanding ofphysics, chemistry, and biology. They must be able to read maps, identify rocks, minerals, and fossils aswell as visualize earth structures in three dimensions. They must have strong communication skills, bothwritten and verbal. Learning to use these skills in an integrated way is a challenging and rewardingexperience.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Geology OptionThe Geology option offers a detailed coverage of the broad range of classic disciplines within thegeosciences. This option emphasizes the study of minerals, rocks and fossils, and teaches the studenthow to understand the processes and history of the earth based on the occurrences and relationships ofthese materials at or near the Earth's surface.Geochemistry OptionThe Geochemistry option is designed for those students who have special interest in the chemicalaspects of the Earth and its materials.Geophysics OptionThe Geophysics option offers the student the opportunity to specialize in the branch of the geosciencesthat investigates physical earth processes such as earthquakes and that images the interior of the earththrough surface-based physical measurements.Earth Science Education OptionThe Earth Science education option provides students with a broad earth science curriculum that meetsthe content goals for secondary earth science teaching. Certification for Earth science teaching is notprovided in the program. Information about teaching certification in Virginia can be obtained from theDepartment of Teaching and Learning.Minor in GeosciencesThe requirements to earn a minor in Geosciences can be found on its checksheet by visiting theUniversity Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.Graduate ProgramThe department offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in geosciences with specializations in many sub-disciplines. (See the Graduate Catalog for further information.)Satisfactory ProgressUniversity policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meetminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see "Academics")and toward the degree.Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.S. in Geosciences with any of the available options canbe found on the specific major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website athttp://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (GEOS)1004: EARTH SCIENCE: OUR PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTUREIntroduction to Earth science, including the fundamental concepts of geology in the modern context ofhumans interacting with the Earth.

RockwellAdjunct Instructors: J. Gustafson, P. Ray, and W. ZutiWeb: www.hnfe.vt.edu2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewNutrition, foods, and exercise science is a unique field of study that builds on the biological and physicalsciences. Human nutrition is directed toward helping people choose food that meets their physiologicalneeds and is consistent with their lifestyles and cultural preferences. Changes in lifestyle and foodconsumption patterns have created consumer demand for new food products that are shelf stable, requirelittle or no preparation, and are appropriate in nutrition content. These trends have increased the need forfood professionals who wish to apply their science background to exploring the nutrient content andchemical and physical properties of foods and food ingredients. Increasing interest in physical fitness andwellness has brought about new professional opportunities in assisting people who want to developappropriate exercise patterns and make healthy changes in their lifestyle.Many contemporary health issues including obesity, heart disease, and cancer have been associated witha person's food intake and level of exercise. This has led to increasing emphasis on health promotion anddisease intervention, and the nutrition and exercise professionals are integral members of the health careteam. Expanding research by private and government agencies focusing on the role of nutrition andphysical activity in health, growth, and aging has created a demand for graduates at the B.S., M.S., andPh.D. levels who have a background and interest in laboratory and experimental methods in nutrition,foods and exercise science. The current interest in physical performance in our society has broadenedthe opportunities for combining expertise in nutrition with exercise and fitness for those with skills incounseling and entrepreneurship. Individuals with a background in food and nutrition are needed to helpsolve the problems of world hunger and food shortages, and the accompanying loss of human potential.There are two options from which an undergraduate student majoring in human nutrition, foods andexercise may choose: Dietetics or Science of Food, Nutrition and Exercise.The department participates in the University's Honors Program (see "Academics" in this catalog).The Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise at Virginia Tech offers Master's and Doctoraldegrees in three specialized areas as they relate to nutrition, physical activity, and health. Graduatestudents may earn a M.S. or a Ph.D. with an emphasis in Molecular and Cellular Science, ClinicalPhysiology and Metabolism, or Behavioral and Community Science.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degreerequirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements forgraduation are referred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hoursrequired for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete allrequirements and university obligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements.DieteticsConsult: Heather K. CoxThe undergraduate Dietetics option, known as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), leads to aBachelor of Science degree in Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise. The dietetics option fulfills allacademic course requirements for a Didactic Program in Dietetics according to the Standards ofEducation per the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). ACEND is theaccrediting arm of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Following completion of the B.S. degree, astudent has earned an ACEND Verification Statement. A student must then complete a supervisedpractice program (Dietetic Internship) to be eligible for the Registration Examination (RD) for Dietitians.The supervised practice requirement can be met through any ACEND accredited dietetic internship.Graduates with the B.S. in Dietetics are eligible to apply for the department's, or other, accredited DieteticInternships.Registered Dietitians work in a variety of work settings. The dietetics program prepares you to assume aprofessional role in health care, research, the business environment or to pursue graduate studies. Thedietetics program ultimately prepares you to assume a professional role in a health care, research, orbusiness setting or to go on to graduate school. Clinical dietitians in hospitals and out-patient clinicsprovide care to individuals with disease-related nutritional problems. Community dietitians may work inhealth clubs specializing in sports nutrition, in work site wellness programs, or in community programsserving mothers and children, low-income families, or elderly people. Others work for food companiesdealing with consumer questions about the nutrient content of food products, or with companiesmanufacturing nutritional supplements or other medical or health products. Administrative Dietitians withmanagement or business interests find positions in food service management in health care facilities,work site, college, or university food service, or hotels and resorts. Registered Dietitians counsel peopleof all ages, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and levels of education.Students in the Dietetics option must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 to remain in this option. Studentswho want to change their major into the Dietetics option with HNFE must have an overall GPA of 3.0.Please see the Satisfactory Progress section for additional requirements.Science of Food, Nutrition, and ExerciseConsult: Renee EatonUpon completion of this option a student is well prepared for graduate work in any area of nutrition,exercise physiology or related sciences. This option also meets most admission requirements formedical, dental, physical therapy, pharmacy, physician assistant, athletic training and other healthprofessions programs. This option allows students flexibility to tailor the degree toward long term goalswhich may lead to employment opportunities in research and development with a company manufacturingnutritional, health and exercise, or medical products, in the food industry in food product testing or qualitycontrol, in the health and fitness industry, or in a position related to clinical exercise physiology. Studentsin this option gain knowledge, skills, and abilities specified by the American College of Sports Medicinefor certification as a Certified Health Fitness Specialist. With the growing attention to the role of nutritionand exercise in health promotion and disease prevention, this option is especially appropriate for thestudent preparing for a career in medicine, physical therapy, or a related health field. The majority ofstudents in the Science of Food, Nutrition and Exercise option plan to attend graduate or professionalschool.Students in the SFNE option do not meet the ACEND requirements for a degree in dietetics andtherefore do not earn a Verification Statement. Students may choose to earn both the Dietetics andSFNE options in the department.Satisfactory ProgressAn HNFE student will be considered to have made satisfactory progress toward the degree when he/shehas successfully completed:In-major GPA â?¥ 2.5 or higher.Overall GPA â?¥ 3.0 or higher (Dietetics option) or â?¥ 2.5 or higher (SNFE option)Grade of C or better in ): DEVELOPMENT AND HUMANITARIANISM IN AFRICAExamines the history of western development and humanitarian projects in Africa, considering westernand African perspectives in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

Landscape architects design across a wide spectrum of projects: parks andgardens, community design, urban design and planning, green infrastructure, and regional planning, as well asat the scale of watersheds and natural systems. The work of the profession is grounded in the natural andsocial sciences, draws inspiration from nature and the arts, and is implemented through innovative design, siteengineering, construction, land management, and environmental technologies. The Landscape ArchitectureProgram guides students as they address some of the most important challenges of our time: climate change;healthy living and empathetic design; urbanization; re-imagining water, food, energy and transportation; greeninfrastructure; remediation of spoiled and disturbed sites; and preserving critical natural resources. We believethe work of the profession, at the critical intersection of natural and cultural systems, will be the mostconsequential of the design arts in the 21st century.The core of the academic program is a rigorous sequence of design studios that allows students to explore abroad range of landscape architectural issues, contexts, and project types. Studios are accompanied bydiscussion, lecture, and laboratory courses that provide systematic and comprehensive coverage of theemerging body of knowledge related to technology, design theory, landscape ecology, and human/environmentinteraction. Off-campus options include a summer travel studio, study at the Washington AlexandriaArchitecture Center, and exchange programs with Tongji University in Shanghai, or University College, Dublin,Ireland, as well as an independent semester abroad and professional internships.The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (B.L.A.) is a five year first-professional degree program fullyaccredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board of the American Society of LandscapeArchitects.

Jasso Hernandez, K.2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewMathematics is essential to a clear and complete understanding of virtually all phenomena. Its precision,depth, and generality support the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The study ofmathematics provides the ability to describe applied problems quantitatively and to analyze theseproblems in a precise and logical manner. This is a principal reason behind the strong demand formathematicians in government and industry. Essentially all complex problems, whether physical, social, oreconomic, are solved by designing a mathematical model, analyzing the model, and determiningcomputational algorithms for an efficient and accurate approximation of a solution. Each of these phasesis mathematical in nature. For example, if a problem deviates from a standard form, a mathematicianshould be able to adjust the usual mathematical treatment of the problem to accommodate the deviation.In this case mathematical training provides a practical preparation for a career in today's changing world.Moreover, it is especially valuable because it is an education that equips one to continue to adapt to newsituations.Mathematicians typically are employed as applied mathematicians in their specialty areas. Our recentmathematics graduates have been approximately equally divided among government and industry,graduate school, and teaching. There are four different paths or options that a student may followtowards a B.S. in Mathematics: 1) the Traditional Option; 2) the Applied Computational MathematicsOption (ACM); 3) the Applied Discrete Mathematics Option (ADM); and 4) the Mathematics EducationOption (MSTR).The Traditional Option, as its name implies, yields a broad and flexible background in mathematics. Theother three options are more specialized. The ACM option is designed for students primarily interested incomputational mathematics and its applications to engineering and the natural and social sciences. TheADM option is designed for students primarily interested in areas of applied mathematics closelyassociated with computer science. The Mathematics Education Option is designed for students who wantto be certified to teach secondary mathematics.Often students will begin their studies in the Traditional Option and later change to one of the other threeoptions when they become more sure of the path they wish to pursue. One, however, can acquire manyaspects of the three specialized options within the Traditional Option, because it also requires somedegree of specialization in an applications area and provides career development features. The threespecialized options are each less general, but bring particular career paths into sharper focus. Each ofthe four options provides an excellent foundation for graduate study, either in mathematics or in anapplications area. Handbooks for each of the options, as well as mathematics career information, areavailable upon request.Approximately $45,000 in Hatcher, Morris, Layman, Rollins, Steeneck, Caldwell, Wells, Oehring, Eckert,Persinger, Kim, Kimball, and Roselle scholarships is awarded annually to mathematics majors at VirginiaTech: $5,000 for incoming freshmen and $40,000 for continuing undergraduates. Information on thescholarships is available from the scholarship chairman in mathematics.Karcher, J. Krueger, C. Letona, E. Rappold, E. Savel'ev, B. Sedai, S. Silber, J. Thompson,V. Tran, J.

KimWeb: www.math.vt.eduThe Cooperative Education Program is also available to qualified candidates, and students wishing to mixpractical experience with their formal course studies are encouraged to investigate this option. For moreinformation, contact Career Services at Virginia Tech.The Mathematics Department firmly believes that mathematics is not only useful and beautiful, but alsofun. The department sponsors student chapters of MAA (Mathematical Association of America), SIAM(Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics), Pi Mu Epsilon (the national mathematics honorarysociety), and AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics). As well as social activities, these groupssponsor speakers to talk on how mathematics is used in their work. Each fall, Virginia Tech also sponsorsthe Virginia Tech Regional Mathematics Contest. In addition, students (not all of whom are mathematicsmajors) annually receive organized preparation and compete in the nationwide William Lowell PutnamCompetition and the international Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Individual undergraduate researchprojects are available to talented students, and a Layman Prize is awarded for the best research project.An overall outstanding senior, as well as an outstanding senior for each option, is recognized each year.The Honors Program in Mathematics provides outstanding undergraduate majors the opportunity for anenriched academic environment. Through honors courses, an honors project, individual association withthe faculty and honors advisors, and other perquisites, the honors student in mathematics enjoys avaluable advantage in the undergraduate experience. Moreover, in coordination with the head ofMathematics and the dean of Science, the honors student may design her/his own individual set ofgraduation requirements.In addition to the four undergraduate-degree options, the department also offers the M.S. and Ph.D.Moreover, for qualified students, a combined program is available that leads to both a B.S. and an M.S.in Mathematics. This program saves a year from the usual time required for a B.S. and an M.S. doneseparately. Students in the Education Option obtain a B.S. in Math and an M.A. in Education bycompleting four years of undergraduate study and a fifth year in education for a full secondarycertification.The minor is designed to provide recognition for those students who take a program of study inmathematics above the normal requirements of their disciplines.Bachelor of Science in MathematicsRequirementsNote that the Calculus curriculum is in transition and there are two possible paths through Calculus. Wedistinguish the two paths as follows: Path 1 for students who have received credit for "

Yauger - BCWeb: http://cem.mlsoc.vt.edu/2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog andAcademic PoliciesMenuOverviewThe Myers-Lawson School of Construction offers students in the College of Engineering a Bachelor ofScience Degree in Construction Engineering and Management. This degree is designed for students whowish to pursue a management or engineering career in the construction industry. The undergraduateprogram facilitates the development of critical technical, managerial and professional knowledge andskills required for entry into the construction industry or graduate studies. This body of knowledgeincludes the decision and optimization methods required to integrate and manage the resources essentialto construction operations along with the skills that support the development of safe, ethical, sociallyresponsible, and sustainable solutions for the built environment. The Construction Engineering andManagement Program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET,www.abet.org.Construction managers plan, direct, and coordinate construction projects, including the building of alltypes of residential, commercial, and industrial structures, roads, bridges, and other public works projects.Construction managers coordinate and supervise the construction process from the conceptualdevelopment stage through final construction, ensuring the project is completed within time and budgetconstraints and is compliant with building and safety codes and other regulations.The focus of this degree is construction management with engineering and business management asadditional focus areas of study. The degree retains an emphasis on engineering, with a focus onconstruction theory and applications, while providing students the opportunity to define the areas ofbusiness management they wish to study to complement their career goals.Coursework (CEM xxxx) focuses on the specific knowledge, skills and abilities (KSA) critical forsuccessful Construction Engineering and Management. Additional coursework is leveraged from the ViaDepartment of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the Department of Building Construction. Thelatter department is also in the School.Consistent with the general program goal of facilitating development of student competence necessary forentry into the construction industry or graduate school, the School has developed the following programobjectives:Within a few years of curriculum completion, graduates of the Construction Engineering andManagement program should be able to combine skills gained through academic preparation andpost-graduation experience to demonstrate:The intellectual ability to critically assess, analyze, integrate and manage constructionengineering problems.An awareness of societal context and how those concerns affect their role as professionalengineers and in turn, how their role can enact beneficial change for society.The values-based leadership and team building skills to effectively function in multi-disciplinary, multi-cultural, open-ended engineering activities in a professional and ethicalmanner, responding dynamically to the social and economic environment that impactsconstruction.The communication skills to convey technical information to a variety of audiences thatinclude all construction stakeholders, including the general public.The ability and desire to engage in life-long learning in order to perpetually develop theirconstruction engineering skills and professional knowledge, e.g. through graduate study, self-study, continuing education, licensure, mentoring, and leadership in their employmentorganizations, industry associations and professional societiesClassroom instruction in the construction engineering and management program is reinforced byinstructional laboratories, field trips and guest lectures by leading construction professionals. Theprogram seeks to employ the latest educational technology and innovative teaching methods.Students in the School have the opportunity to participate in a summer internship program duringwhich they may apply the concepts learned in the classroom in real world applications. The Schoolencourages all students to participate in professional work experience prior to graduation, and allstudents are encouraged to pursue their FE and PE licenses.Class Size LimitationCurrently, the program is not capped. The Industry has requested that CEM double in size due toindustry demand for graduates.The contact person for the undergraduate Construction Engineering and Management program is Dr.Robert Muir at (540) 231-9959 or rmuirjr@vt.edu. The CEM advisor is Ann Lee at (540) 231-5376 orannlee3@vt.edu.Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. Requirements for graduation arereferred to via university publications as "Checksheets". The number of credit hours required for degreecompletion varies among curricula. Students should choose the appropriate Checksheet based on theirexpected graduation date. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and universityobligations for degree completion.The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university willnot alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program.Please visit the University Registrar website at https://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief.html fordegree requirements.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (BC)1214: INTRODUCTION TO BUILDING CONSTRUCTION IThis is an introduction to the world of construction with an overview of the important areas of contractingand the inter-workings of the construction industry.

The program resides in, and is organized as a divisionof, the College of Science's Academy of Integrated Science.A "systems approach" to biology involves the study of the biological, chemical, and physical processeswithin living organisms as they interact in complex ways to produce life-supporting behaviors. The VirginiaTech program in Systems Biology focuses on the powerful, emerging paradigm of molecular systemsbiology, i.e., on computational, systems-level approaches that connect the biochemical and geneticproperties of individual macromolecules (DNA, RNA, protein, lipids, polysaccharides) with thephysiological behavior of living cells and tissues. These levels of biological organization, which comprisethe gap between interacting macromolecules and cell physiology, embody an active area of researchproducing technological and biomedical innovations. The Systems Biology program bridges themolecular/cell divide, training students for employment or graduate education in this burgeoning field.Division Leader: J. TysonProgram Manager: C.

Sinceits inception in 2008, the Center has adopted three thematic areas:The prevention of violencePeace studiesThe development of new leaders for this centuryThe Center is a hub for research and pedagogy on peace studies and violence prevention. Ourmultidisciplinary approach allows students, faculty, and a variety of off-campus constituents to addresspeace building and violence prevention in a holistic manner.The Center for Peace Studies offers a minor in Peace Studies. The minor is designed to provide studentswith a broad perspective on violence prevention and peace building. Students minoring in Peace Studieswill be required to take two core courses, Peace and Violence as Critical Incidents ("
PSVP 2044,") andGlobal Society, Violence and the Prospects for Peace ("
PSVP 4104,"). In addition, students will select fourelective courses from a variety of courses that focus on either "local" issues of violence prevention andpeace building or "global" issues of violence prevention and peace building.Center for Race & Social PolicyDirector: Wornie ReedThe Center for Race and Social Policy (RSP), presently a College Center, was formed in April 2001 as aUniversity Center to fulfill two primary goals: (1) to conduct and disseminate original research in the areaof public policy with a direct emphasis on race and ethnicity; and (2) to prepare promising graduatestudents to think and speak critically, plan quality research, and contribute to public-policy discussionsrelated to race and ethnicity.The Center promotes a broad and inclusive concept of race and ethnicity, which includes AfricanAmericans, American Indians, Asian Americans, European Americans, Latinos, and bi-racial and multi-racial identities. RSP research projects involve the development and evaluation of public policy acrossdifferent racial and ethnic contexts and within myriad public policy venues, including welfare,employment, education, and health as well as community outreach.Undergraduate Course Descriptions (AFST)1714: INTRODUCTION TO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIESIntroduction to the interdisciplinary field of African American Studies.
