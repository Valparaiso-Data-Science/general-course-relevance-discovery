Course taught in English. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core require-ment. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation require-ment. Offered every other year.305  Culture in the Third Reich   Was National Socialism the incar-nation of evil in the modern world?  How could twelve years of Nazi control in Germany alter world history? Did its culture consist only of propaganda and party rallies? Why did the Nazi leadership consider art and culture so central to its political goals?  In the past 25 years scholars have taken a serious look at Nazi culture and revealed a much more complex set of factors at work in all areas of cultural life. This inter-disciplinary course introduces students to the often contradictory but fascinating historical, social, and economic conditions that led to cultural shifts when the Nazis came to power in 1933 and then examines how Nazi policies simultaneously and systematically influenced all aspects of life in Nazi Germany (Gleichschaltung). Students consider both the ‘low-brow’ culture and everyday life as well as the more traditional and so-phisticated do-mains of ‘high’ culture. Topics include: religion, youth ed-ucation, the ‘camp system,’ Fascism, environmentalism, racial theories, disability and discrimination, propaganda and entertainment films, music and theatre, art and architecture, gender roles and family, and consumer culture. Course taught in English. Offered every other year. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.310  WWI in Literature and the Other Arts, 1908-1938  This course ex-plores the words, actions, thoughts and feelings of the individual amidst the catastrophe of war. The course treats a wide variety of materials that relate to WWI, including lyric poetry, novels, memoirs, visual art, film, and deliberative and commemorative oratory. Students explore the ways in which various rhetorical and narrative treatments of soldiers and of war offer us understandings of the subjective experiences and ethical choices of ordinary and extraordinary people under extreme stress and facing horrendous challenges. The course also intends to consider no-tions of the individual, the community, and civilization (with all that word implies), against the backdrop of the chaotic action of war and combat. Course taught in English. Offered every other year. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement. 315  Talking about the Weather: Subversion, Counter-Culture, and Resistance  This course considers a wide variety of materials from film, literature, theoretical texts, and the Internet in order to examine the influ-ence of protest, revolt, and the power of resistance on post-war German society from the 1960s to the present. Major themes and questions from this course include: To what extent is the “spirit of the sixties” still alive and to what end? What are the legacies, and perhaps myths, that coalesce around such movements in the contemporary imagination? How does this triumvirate continue to shape Germany today? Course taught in English.

Offered every year.276  Studies in Western Art II: Fourteenth to the Twenty-First Century   This class introduces students to artistic works created in Western Europe and the Americas from circa 1300 CE to the present. Students will learn to discuss how art communicates, while pursuing larger questions of meaning related to the social, cultural, and artistic context in which the works were created. While students will learn to identify stylistic characteristics, particular emphasis is given to how the works complement and/or reflect particular political, spiritual, scientific, or philosophical issues. Discussion and writings stress the interpretive methods of the discipline of art history. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every year.278  Survey of Asian Art   This course is a survey of the major artistic traditions of Asia, primarily of China, India, and Japan, from prehistoric times to the turn of the twentieth century. It examines important mon-uments and emphasizes the interaction of art and society, specifically, how different artistic styles are tied to different intellectual beliefs, geographical locations, and other historical contexts. The course in-cludes a field trip to the Seattle Asian Art Museum. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every semester.294  Art History Research Methods   This course examines the ori-gins and history of the discipline of art history and serves as an introduc-tion to fundamental methods of art historical research (e.g., biographi-cal, formalist, iconographic, sociological, feminist, etc.) approaches. The course, intended for prospective and recently declared majors, prepares students for more advanced courses in art history. This generally chronological seminar also provides hands-on learning of museological and archival procedures, and offers students the opportunity to become acquainted with and to practice different types of art historical writing (e.g., ranging from catalog entry to book review). Students also have the opportunity to develop and refine their research skills through the com-pletion of a substantial research project. Students present their work to the class both in formal and informal presentations throughout the term. Prerequisite: Second-year standing or above, and two art history courses completed at a university. Offered every year.302  The Art of Mexico and Mesoamerica   This course introduces the arts of Mesoamerica and Mexico from 1200 BCE to the present. Architecture, sculpture, pottery, and painting of the pre-Columbian and Viceregal periods are examined with their ritual functions in mind, focus-ing on the political and religious contexts of the works. Style is analyzed throughout the course as a product of cultural intersection and transmis-sion, reflecting ongoing adaptation and assimilation rather than the he-gemonic expression of one particular culture. Readings and discussions of the 16th and 19th centuries include the reception of “New World” Art and Art HistoryUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     45images and objects by European and North American audiences, in-vestigating the power of art to create, confirm, or reject views of other cultures.

In addition to the well-known artists who generally define the period (Giotto, Donatello, Botticelli) the course covers a variety of artists, media, and sites that broaden students’ understanding of the early Renaissance, examining formal transformations within social, political, and religious contexts. Students focus particularly on how art was used in the civic structure of both re-publics and courts, and how individual patrons shaped the visual arts in Italy from the early fourteenth-century innovations of Giotto to the late fifteenth-century innovations of Leonardo and Michelangelo. In addition to understanding how visual images communicate by developing skills of formal analysis of art and architecture, students focus on the inter-pretation of how and what particular styles conveyed in society. Writing assignments include the critical analysis of art historical writing, analysis of style, and a research paper. Prerequisite: second year standing or above. Offered every third year.359  Islamic Art   Islamic culture is truly global, encircling the planet from the Islamic Center of Tacoma, Washington, to the Kaaba in Mecca, to the myriad mosques of Xinjiang Province in China. The history of the Islamic world is equally vast, spanning over a millennium. This course focuses on the history of Islamic visual culture from the 7th through the 17th century and explores works of art in a variety of media (e.g. architecture and monumental decoration, book illuminations, ceram-ics, metal-works, textiles, etc.) both from the religious and the secular realms. Art works are examined with particular attention to their original function, context, and intended audience, and are presented from a range of methodological perspectives. Topics of special interest include: formation of Islamic art; functioning and decoration of Islamic religious artifacts and architecture; development of regional styles; interactions of text and image; visual expressions of power and authority; reflections of gender; garden culture. Prerequisite: second year standing or above. Offered every third year.360  Art and Architecture of Ancient Greece   The civilization of an-cient Greece has an important place in the formation of Western culture and in the development of Art History as a discipline. This course ex-amines the art produced in Greece and the Greek world from the Early Bronze Age through the Hellenistic period (ca. 3000 BCE to 1st c. BCE), with particular emphasis on artistic production of the 8th through the 1st century BCE. Works of art are examined with particular attention to their original function, context, and intended audience, and are presented from a range of methodological perspectives. Topics of special interest include: gender and the body; images of women; power and visual pro-paganda; function and decoration of painted pots; narrative strategies; architecture and decoration of sanctuaries; votives; funerary monu-ments; art of the domestic sphere; the history of the study of Greek art.

Offered every other year.362  Art, Religion, and Power in Late Antiquity and Byzantium   This course explores the artistic traditions of the Late Antique and Byzantine periods from the earliest surviving monuments of Christian art of the mid-3rd century to the monuments of the Late Byzantine Empire up to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. The course examines how the in-teractions between the Greco-Roman, Jewish, and Christian traditions produced the art of Late Antiquity and Byzantium, and accentuates the visual, social, and religious continuities and ruptures between these traditions. Works of art are examined with particular attention to their original function, context, and intended audience, and are presented from a range of methodological perspectives. Topics of special interest include: the formation of Christian art; images of power and authority; representations of gender; the function and decoration of liturgical space; icons, image theory, and the Iconoclastic controversy; depic-tions of the secular world. Prerequisite: second-year standing or above. Offered every other year.363  Faith and Power in the Art of the Medieval West (7-14th cen-tury)   This course introduces the art of Medieval Western Europe from the Period of Migrations through the Gothic Era (7-14th century.) A fundamental social and cultural transformation of Western Europe followed the end of the Roman Empire characterized by the increasing dominance of the Christian Church, the interaction of various cultural and ethnic groups, the development of feudalism, and the eventual renascence of the Western Roman Empire. The intermingling of the Germanic, Greco-Roman, Early Christian, and Byzantine pictorial tradi-tions produced a distinct visual culture that developed separately from the artistic tradition of the Byzantine East. Works of art are examined with particular attention to their original function, context, and intended audience, and are presented from a range of methodological perspec-tives. Topics of special interest include the role of relics and pilgrimage, the visual expression of imperial and monastic ideology, revival and rejection of the classical style, function and decoration of liturgical spac-es, and the role of words and images in illuminated books. Prerequisite: second-year standing or above. Offered every other year.365  Nineteenth-Century Art and Architecture in Europe and the Americas   The period between 1780 and the end of the nineteenth century is marked by myriad social changes and scientific/technical in-novations, from revolutions across Europe and the Americas, enlighten-ment thought, and increasing emphasis on human rights, to the innova-tion of photography, steel construction, and paint in tubes. This course studies how artists and architects responded to these developments, focusing particularly on the shift from academic works to the rise of Art and Art History46     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  modernism and the avant-garde.

The course examines a wide range of material—architecture and monumental decoration, painting, sculpture, as well as works of minor arts—to understand the role art played in various societies of the ancient and medieval world. Works of art are examined with particular attention to their original function, con-text, and intended audience in order to explore how they expressed po-litical, social, and religious meanings. The course introduces key terms and principal methods of art historical inquiry. Prerequisite: admission to the Honors Program. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core require-ment. Students may not receive credit for both . Offered spring term only.211  Metamorphosis and Identity  This course explores identity across the centuries through stories about metamorphosis. The nature of change reflects cultural, intellectual, and social differences that un-dergird these stories about self and form from fifth-century Athens to twentieth-century Germany. The course examines how early cultures both anticipate modern ideas of individualism as well as radically diverge in their assumptions about human nature, personal and communal obligations, and change as a threat to or regeneration of order. All of the stories, verbal and visual, reflect tensions and paradoxes through a highly conscious working out of the boundaries between the personal and communal, interior and exterior, private and public, animal and human, despite the fact that they do not share a view of the individual or self that corresponds to a contemporary (and thus diverse) sense of personal identity and autonomy. Prerequisite: admission to the Honors Program. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. To be taken in the first year. Offered spring term only.212  Origins of the Modern World View   This course studies the de-velopment of attempts by scientific thinkers to understand and explain the universe. The central theme is the development of astronomy and physics, but some mention is made of corollary studies in mathematics and other sciences. A major portion of the course is devoted to the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century and the work of Kepler, Galileo, and Newton. Another major portion concerns the development of twentieth-century physics, concentrating on relativity and the quan-tum theory as developed by Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, and others. Prerequisite: admission to the Honors Program. Satisfies the Natural Scientific Approaches core requirement. Offered fall term only.213  Mathematical Reasoning: Foundations of Geometry   This course uses the idea of symmetry as an invitation to explore contempo-rary mathematics. The roots of the mathematics of symmetry extend back to ancient times, and the current mathematical expression of sym-metry was first developed in the early 19th century. The course explores both the history and mathematics of this development and traces where the key ideas have led from there, both mathematically and culturally. Emphasis is placed on how mathematics is discovered and how it fits into broader cultural contexts (including the work of M.C. Escher, frac-tals, and symmetry in fields other than mathematics). Prerequisite: ad-mission to the Honors Program. Satisfies the Mathematical Approaches core requirement. Offered spring term only.214  Interrogating Society   This course has as its subject matter the individual’s relation to society and the relationships that arise among individuals, organizations, and institutions over questions of value.  It thus enables students to understand their relation to the social world considered as a web of complex and dynamic interrelationships among cultural, economic, psychological, political, ethical and social factors. To this end, the course examines various theories and methods used to an-alyze this social world, their embedded assumptions, and their applica-tion to a variety of contemporary social issues. Prerequisite: admission to the Honors Program. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered fall term only.401  What is America?   This course provides a comparative, inter-disciplinary, and critical examination of “America” (the U.S.) and its endurance as both idea and ideal. Students consider what “America” means--as a place and as a concept, historically and in contemporary times, and to different constituents.  Readings and discussion topics address broad issues that have shaped U.S. history and contemporary life, especially those areas around which national identity coheres and those about which the nation has been most conflicted: politics and governance; slavery and freedom; the natural world; capitalism and consumption; industry and technology; immigration and exclusion; civil rights and social justice; culture and the arts. Prerequisite: admission to the Honors Program and completion of all other Honors core courses, or permission from Honors Program Director. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.INTERDISCIPLINARY HUMANITIESCo-directors: Kriszta Kotsis, Art and Art History; Katherine Smith, HistoryAdvisory Committee: Greta Austin, Religious Studies/Gender and Queer Studies, Gwynne Brown, School of Music, Derek Buescher, Communication Studies, Andrew Gomez, History/Latina/o Studies, Alison Tracy Hale, English, Grace Livingston, African American Studies, Geoffrey Proehl, Theatre Arts, Justin Tiehen, PhilosophyAffiliated Faculty: Denise Despres, English/Honors/Humanities; George Erving, English/Honors/Humanities (on leave Spring 2019)About the ProgramThe Interdisciplinary Humanities Emphasis (IHE) offers designated pathways that encourage students to consider topics of enduring importance from a variety of humanistic perspectives. The emphasis can complement a student’s major in any field of study. Each of the pathways described below includes multiple courses through which students can complete a number of their university core and grad-uation requirements (Artistic Approaches, Humanistic Approaches, Connections, the Knowledge, Identity, and Power Graduation Requirement, and upper division electives). A student who satisfies the requirements within a single pathway is eligible to receive the Interdisciplinary Humanities Emphasis designation on their transcript. This notation signals that the student has, through significant themat-ic, interdisciplinary study, mastered the skills of critical and creative thinking and of clear and effective writing fostered by the humanities disciplines. These skills form the basis for engaged citizenship and pro-fessional success in virtually any career.130     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Interdisciplinary HumanitiesThe program also offers interdisciplinary courses that are not incor-porated into the pathways, but draw on several disciplines to explore a focused topic.First-year students may join the Humanities Residential Program. These students form a living-learning community by taking their fall first-year seminars together, and by enjoying a variety of co-curricular activities such as film screenings, open-mic nights, guest lectures, din-ner events, and trips to Seattle and Tacoma theatres, concert halls, and museums. Acceptance into the program is not limited to those intending to major in the humanistic disciplines; many will go on to major in the sciences and social sciences, but all share a special interest in the arts and humanities.Requirements for the Interdisciplinary  Humanities EmphasisCompletion of five units to include:1. Five units chosen from a single pathway, two of which must be at the 300-level or above. 2. Students wishing to declare the IHE meet with the program direc-tor or a member of the faculty advisory committee to discuss their educational goals and create a plan for completion of one of the pathways. This plan will be finalized in a signed contract to be filed with the Office of the Registrar. Once filed, the contract will be reviewed periodically, and may be modified as needed.3. In the first semester of their senior year, students pursuing the IHE submit to the program director a short essay that reflects on their progress in their chosen pathway and its relevance to their ma-jor(s), minor(s), or other programs of study.Notes1. Because these pathways are not intended as substitutes for a mi-nor or major, students may not count more than two units from any department or program towards a single pathway.2. A student may double-count a maximum of two units from any given pathway with each major, minor, or program that the student plans to complete.3. With permission of the program director, students may substitute one of the five required units with a relevant second semester, second year (or higher) foreign language course, e.g., German 202, French 202, etc.  4. Courses in the IHE may not be taken as Pass/Fail.5. A student must have a grade of C- or higher in all courses of the IHE.6. Four out of the five required units must be taken on campus.IHE PathwaysThe Artist as HumanistThis pathway encourages students to engage with the interplay be-tween creativity, creative processes, and humanistic concerns such as the representation of cultural values, exploration of identity, and inquiry into questions of meaning within the fields of visual and literary arts, theatre, and music. It fosters questions about the complex relationships between artists, aesthetic objects, and audiences. Courses in this path-way explore the following questions:• How do aesthetic objects or performances alter perceptions and communicate ideas, and how do they participate in larger social and political discourses?• What is the role of sensations, emotions, and poetics in invoking form, conveying meaning, and fostering critical thinking?• How does the creative process itself contribute to the production of knowledge?: The Arts of the Classical World and Middle Ages (Artistic Approaches Core) [Only for students enrolled in the Honors Program.]: The Arts of the Classical World and Middle Ages (Artistic Approaches Core) [Only for students enrolled in the Honors Program.]"

Beginning with Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre (1847), students examine a variety of stories, novels, and films that rework aspects of Brontë’s vision. Students study the context of each revision and its commentary on the original text and examine shifts in the critical and feminist reception of these texts. Texts vary, but are selected from the following: Braddon, Gissing, James, Woolf, Forster, du Maurier, Rhys, Kincaid, Balasubramanyam, Winterson. Students produce both creative and analytic work.347  Gothic American Literature   This course explores the theoretical, political, and aesthetic dimensions of the gothic literary tradition in the U.S. from its late 18th-century inception to the current day. Along with a variety of primary literature, students consider foundational theoretical texts (Freud, Lacan) and secondary sources relevant to the uniquely American iteration of the Gothic, particularly those that interrogate the tradition’s functions as dark counter-narrative to progressive U.S. ideolo-gy. Authors may include the following: Brown, Poe, Hawthorne, Crane, James, Wharton, O’Connor, Faulkner, Jackson, Capote, Whitehead.348  Illness and Narrative:  Discourses of Disease   The discursive negotiation between illness (its politics, histories, and personalities) and language is at the heart of this course. Through a close examination of a variety of texts (novels, plays, comics, film, etc.) that take illness as their central subject matter, students explore a series of questions including: What influence does illness (epidemic or personal) have on narrative? What is the relationship between social and political attitudes toward disease and the way texts characterize healthy and sick?  What are the recuperative or reformative functions of narrative?  Texts under study will be drawn largely from the 20th and 21st centuries and will include a number of theoretical and critical readings on illness and narrative.349  Captivity and American Identity   Beginning with the genre’s ori-gins in colonial America, this course historicizes and contextualizes the captivity narrative—a category first constructed around white men and women living among Indians, or kidnapped by Barbary pirates and held captive in Africa—in relation to the emergence of ideological American-ness in the colonial and early national periods. The course investigates the rise and function of emblematic captivity stories like those of Mary Rowlandson, Elizabeth Hanson, and Mercy Short as they constituted a particular racial and cultural notion of white identity in contrast to a “savage” Other.  In addition to such conventional readings, however, this course also incorporates works by Native Americans (such as William Apess and Zitkala-Ša) and African Americans (David Walker, Harriet Wilson, Harriet Jacobs) who frame their experiences with white America as a kind of captivity, in order to examine how their works com-plicate the ideological assumptions of the genre and offer contradictory perspectives on the nature of captivity, race, and identity. Offered every third year.353  The Bible and the Literary Tradition   The Christian Bible, com-prising the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) and New Testament, continues to shape imaginative literature, which in turn has a long and dynamic history of engaging scripture in response to various social and ideological issues. A study of the interaction between the Bible and liter-ature is therefore not simply an analysis of what the Bible says, but also of how the Bible has been understood or interpreted by various cultures, an examination that may include an introduction to the traditions that shaped the very composition of certain Hebrew and Christian texts. Instructors may focus on a specific period and translation—for example, the literature that shaped and responded to the King James translation of the 17th century—or provide a comprehensive survey of Biblical texts in relation to literature both ancient and modern.354  Literatures of Empire   This course studies the British empire of the 19th Century and its slow dissolution during the course of the 20th century.  The primary emphasis is on Britons’ engagement with and responses to the idea of empire, as reflected in literary and non-literary texts of the time, and is informed by contemporary political and postco-lonial theory. Students consider debates about imperialism, the role of culture in imperial expansion, the conception of national character, and the process of decolonization are studied, as the class traces the theory of empire in the metropole and its practice in the colonies. Writers may include Hastings, Macaulay, Kipling, Schreiner, Anand, Conrad, Yeats, Joyce, Forster, Greene, Achebe, Gordimer, Rushdie, Chandra, and Friel.355  Books of the Booker Prize   From 1968 to 2013, the Man Booker prize was awarded annually to the “finest” full-length novel written by a citizen of the British Commonwealth or the Republic of Ireland, and English92     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  bestowed honor, recognition, and controversy upon the winning author. The Booker inhabits an uneasy intersection of high art and mass cultural approbation, and while the judges would likely assert that the prize con-siders aesthetic matters only, a more realistic assessment would sug-gest that issues of historical contingency inevitably inflect the selection process. By studying winning novels by such authors as J. G. Farrell, Salman Rushdie, A. S. Byatt, and Ben Okri and considering relevant literary criticism and scholarship on the marketing of literary fiction, this course explores what the Booker Prize reveals about changing notions of postcolonial politics, economic structure, and gender roles—in short, of British national identity and Commonwealth affiliation.356  Bollywood Film   This course focuses on “Bollywood” cinema from the 1950s (immediately following India’s independence) to the present. It asks why Indian popular cinema has a wider global audience and appeal than Hollywood and who is watching Bollywood films. In tracing the development of Indian cinema, the class addresses the ways films articulate the new nation’s dreams and desires, fears and follies, anxieties and growing pains.357  City as Text   This course examines the city as a social, cultural, and historical construct. Drawing on texts from a variety of genres, as well as cultural products that may include diaries, maps, photographs, and motion pictures, students consider one, two, or three selected cit-ies as they have developed over time. The course highlights the function of rhetorical and ideological constructions such as “the city,” “citizen-ship,” and “urbanity,” and explores the symbolic and political associa-tions of such terms. The particular cities, topics, materials, and historical scope are determined by the instructor; please consult the department website for the most current information.Cultural Traditions361  South Asian Fiction   This course is an introduction to some of the variety and complexity of fiction from India. It focuses primarily on novels and short stories written in English and considers the role they played in colonial, anti-colonial, and nationalist struggles and in definitions of who constitutes an “Indian.” It also engages post-colonial theorists of the last two decades, including G. Viswanathan, P. Chatterjee, B. Ashcroft, A. Loomba, H. Bhaba, and H. Trevedi. The course studies the work of liter-ary writers selected from among the following: Tagore, Anand, Narayan, Rushdie, Ghosh, Roy, Sahgal, Hariharan, Chandra, Desai.362  Native American Literature   This course considers the Native American literary tradition and related historical and critical devel-opments.  Emphases vary by semester but are selected from major concerns and movements within the tradition and may include oral lit-eratures, “mixed-race” and tribal identities, forced assimilation, literary colonialism, and American Indian nationalism.  Students gain mastery of a critical vocabulary specific to the subject and, with increasing sophis-tication, articulate their own responses to the literature.

Using critical and analyt-ical tools studied over the course of the semester, students learn ways of exploring the theatrical experience both orally and in writing. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement.215  Fundamentals of Acting   In this introductory course, students col-laborate in the rehearsal and performance of scenes from contemporary plays. They engage mind, body, and voice in the fundamentals of acting: behaving truthfully in imaginary circumstances. In doing so, students develop greater confidence and awareness of the body and the voice as flexible instruments of communication. They acquire skills in relaxation, concentration, creativity, script analysis, and action execution, along with an introductory understanding of the Stanislavsky system of acting. Participation includes rigorous physical activity, vocal exercises, theatre games, improvisation, and scene work. All levels of experience wel-come. Students must also register for the 215 lab.217  Technical Theatre   This course introduces students to materials and methods used in the execution of designs for the stage.

Reading assignments introduce major reference books in technical theatre and students begin the study of the history of scenery and technical practice. Prerequisite: permission of instructor. 250  World Theatre I: African Diaspora  Through the lens of tradition and innovation, students explore contemporary theatre of the African Diaspora with an emphasis on the plays of Suzan-Lori Parks. Students in this and all contemporary world theatre courses en-gage with and collaborate in a set of informed, imaginative explorations of plays with a particular emphasis on dramatic action. They work toward the com-pletion of this goal by 1) investigating, in light of performance, a play’s dramaturgy both from within (formally) and from without (historically, culturally); 2) by cutting, arranging, and producing scenes from plays they are studying; 3) by discovering formal and thematic threads that run through the plays, readings, and topics of the class; 4) by considering ways to increase the breadth and depth of theatre productions at Puget Sound through course work grounded in the KnowldegeKnowledge, Identity, and Power rubric. Although contemporary world theatre class-es have similar learning outcomes and a common methodology, the plays and fields of study (e.g. African Diaspora, Asian Theatres, Voices of the Americas) dif-fer from one class to another. Taught in rotation with  or 215 and permission of instructor.  325  Playwriting   The  course introduces students to the art and craft of playwriting by combining seminar and workshop formats in which members write, present, and revise monologues, dialogues, and sketch-es.  Students work toward a final portfolio of this material as well as the completion of a short one-act play. The course also involves the analysis and discussion of published, produced plays; of conflict, suspense, characterization, plot, and other elements of drama; and of writing with actors, directors, producers, dramaturgs, and theatre audiences in mind. Crosslisted as , 250, 252, 254, or 256.373  Theatre History II: 18th Century to the Present    Through dra-maturgical analysis, studies of artist biography, and creative projects, students explore how, why, when, and where people have made the-atre from the mid-seventeenth century to the contemporary moment.

From there the course follows African American literature as its production accelerates and its variety expands after Emancipation, during and after Reconstruction, into the early 20th century. Students study poetry, prose, and drama from the Harlem Renaissance (circa 1919-1934). The latter part of the course concerns literature from the Civil Rights Era, the Black Arts period of the 1960s and 1970s, and more recent decades, when African American literature, criticism, and literary theory achieved immeasurable success and generated enormous influ-ence nationally and globally. Cultivating an informed sense of African American literature as a whole is one major objective of the course. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.210  Black Fictions and Feminism   This course is an integrative course in the humanities that explores various constructions of black female identity. The course looks at black womanhood as it’s represent-ed in the public imaginary, feminist theories, critical race theories, and in literature and literary criticism written by black women writers. One of the questions the course asks is: How have scholars and writers ad-dressed fundamental questions of black female identity? To answer this question, students read and view a wide survey of materials including novels, essays, memoir, and film. Through this investigation, students consider how studies of race, feminism, and gender connect to personal lives. Prerequisites:  strongly recommended. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.265  Thinking Ethically: What is Justice?   This course provides students with tools of ethical analysis so that they can think critically about pressing contemporary moral issues through the lens of justice. The course focuses on ethical methods from world Christianity and western philosophy. The course introduces both ethical theories and modern justice theories, and examines multicultural perspectives of the long-standing religious and philosophical understanding of justice. It analyzes how social justice concepts have been applied in different cul-tural contexts, including non-western communities. Students examine different models of justice and their implications for contemporary moral issues (e.g. healthcare, social welfare, racism, war, capital punishment, human rights, immigration, refugees, property rights, and the environ-ment). The class includes interactive lectures on justice theories and students actively participate in discussions on selected case studies. Course readings include excerpts from Aristotle, Aquinas, Mill, Pope, Locke, Calvin, Kant, Rawls, Sandel, Nussbaum, Singer, and Hauerwas.

Interpreting literary works within their historical context, this course introduces students to various genres and themes that are particular to the culture and society of China and Japan. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Satisfies a core requirement for the Asian Studies Minor. Offered frequently.215  Stories of the Strange: From Fox Spirits to The Monkey King in Chinese Literature   The cultures that have occupied modern-day China have left incredibly long and varied written histories.  Among these histories, accounts of the strange and anomalous are often over-looked, and yet they provide a wealth of critical information about cul-ture in a broad sense.  This class uses analysis of stories of ghosts, de-mons, fox-spirits and other anomalies from over 2000 years of Chinese literary history as a way to understand Chinese fiction generally, but also to shed light on the ways in which the authors approached issues of identity, the other, society, and conceptions of the transcendent. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occa-sionally.  225  Visualized Fiction: Cinematic Adaptations of Traditional Chinese Literature   Classical Chinese literature has contributed the inspiration and source materials for a host of modern cultural products. This course is designed to help students develop an awareness of the importance, uses and the significance of classical Chinese literature in modern cultural production. In this course, students study classical texts in English translation and their modern and contemporary film adaptations. In the process, students try to understand what about the original classics appeals to modern cultural producers, and what cultur-al, social, and political purposes they might serve in different modern contexts. The goals of this course are 1) to develop an overall under-standing of major Chinese literary genres; 2) to examine why traditional Chinese literature still matters to us today and why literary works from the past have been used by the West and recycled in our modern cul-tural production; 3) to demonstrate critical thinking through written and oral expression; and 4) to retrieve and use written information critically and effectively. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.310  Death and Desire in Premodern Japanese Literature   One of the most prominent themes of early Japanese literature is a longing for and deep appreciation of beauty coupled with a poignant understanding of its perishability. In this class students read classical Japanese literature from the mid-eighth to the mid-eighteenth century and analyze the works in the context of these major themes of desire and death. In such varied works as The Tale of the Genjii, Chûshingura (the story of the 47 ronin), and the memoirs of Medieval recluses, students explore the different shapes that desire and death take, and how the treatment of these themes changes alongside developments in Japanese culture. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.315  Narrative and Nation in Modern Chinese Literature   This course is a survey of major works of literature from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan produced between the late Qing period and the 1980s. Students become familiar with prominent themes of Chinese literature from the turbulent 20th century, examining the works for what they have to say about such topics as modernity, tradition, gender and subjectivity. The goals of this course are to 1) become familiar with the most critically acclaimed literary voices of the modern period; 2) to identify dominant themes in the literature of the period and examine what they say about what it means to be human; 3) to develop skills in critical reading, think-ing and writing. Offered occasionally.320  Self and Society in Modern Japanese Literature   This course is a survey of modern Japanese literature with an emphasis on Japanese writers in the late nineteenth through the twentieth centuries who struggled with questions of identity. The course is organized chronolog-ically and focuses on some of the major authors of the modern period, including Natsume Sôseki, Tanizaki Jun’ichiro, Kawabata Yasunari, and Mishima Yukio. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.325  Chinese Cinema: Ideology and the Box Office   Chinese cinema is a global powerhouse, winning major international awards and captur-ing remarkable box office receipts. However, like most Chinese stories, that of Chinese film is a long and intricate one. In this course, students will be exposed to the broad historical scope of Chinese cinema from the earliest silent films of the 1920s to some of the most recent critical productions. Through films by Zhang Yimou, Ang Lee, Stephen Chow and Bruce Lee, among many others, students will explore the funda-mental tensions between artistic expression and the political context of the day in addition to commercial pressures. Students will also approach issues of identity, gender, ethnicity, and modernity while developing basic film analysis techniques.  Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.  Offered occasionally.330  Writing the Margins in Contemporary Japanese Literature   This course surveys contemporary and post-modern literature in the post-war period. The examination of the self and its representation that has dominated Japanese literature since the Meiji period (1868-1912) took on a new urgency and tone in Japan’s post-war period, with many authors exploring identities that challenged the established order. For some, that Asian Languages and CulturesUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     49challenge was expressed through transgression and violence; for others, it was embodied in characters who lived outside of the boundaries of so-cial acceptance. During a post-war period of general economic prosperity in which the Japanese government has famously taken pride in being a “homogenous” society, the country’s contemporary literature is consis-tently and remarkably populated by characters who live on the margins of that homogenous identity. This course will explore the dominant themes of the most important modern and post-modern authors of Japan, in-cluding Ôe Kenzaburo, Haruki Murakami, and Yoshimoto Banana, with particular emphasis on these marginalized characters and what they say about the “center” and the self.  Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.335  The Chinese Classic Novel: Real Illusions, Virtuous Violence, and the Romance of the State   The narrative tradition in Chinese literature is a long and complex one, but while Chinese poetry is said to have reached its height in the Tang and Song Dynasties, there is a near-universal agreement that the novels of the Ming and Qing Dynasties represent the golden age of fiction in the Chinese language. These novels cover an incredible range, from pointed satire to subtle and moving romance, from magical adventures to grand political drama, and from heroic war epics to the vividly ribald. The class’s primary focus is on reading and interpreting selections from six novels: The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, The Marshes of Mont Liang, Journey to the West, The Plum in the Golden Vase, The Scholars, and The Dream of the Red Mansions. Through these texts, students gain a detailed un-derstanding of the historical and cultural contexts of the novels, as well as a deep understanding of the ways in which the authors approached all aspects of human existence, from the practical to the religious and philosophical. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally. 345  Revenge and Retribution in Chinese Literature   Since antiquity, many cultures have turned to retribution as a means of restoring justice. Stories about getting even through revenge abound in both highbrow and popular Chinese literature. The themes of revenge and retribution have lent themselves effectively to various literary genres throughout Chinese history, from historical biographies and classical tales to vernacular short stories and plays, extending all the way into twentieth-century ballet and film. Literature has served as an important site of inquiry into the morali-ty and mechanisms of revenge and retribution, sometimes offering con-clusions that are a good deal more ambiguous than legal and philosophi-cal discourses about the same question. This course works through four organizing themes: The Collective (assassination and self-destruction for a larger cause); The Individual (revenge and redemption in interpersonal relationships); Modern Man and Nation Building (from the Republican Period to Socialism); and Transnational Interpretations of “China’s Hamlet”. By the end of the course students should be able to identify the relevant genres, produce effective oral and written analyses of the ma-terial, and critically and cogently reflect on how Chinese conceptions of revenge and retribution might help them think through their own beliefs about revenge, justice, forgiveness, and identity. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.Chinese101/102  First Year Chinese   Introduction to the fundamentals of Mandarin Chinese in four basic skills: comprehension, speaking, read-ing, and writing.

Offered every other year.360  German Cultural History and Politics  No one can hope to com-prehend the challenges Germany faces today without confronting the triumphs and tragedies of the German past. Questions of sovereignty and individual freedom, as argued by bloggers and in the press, acquire su-preme significance when viewed in light of Germany under Bismarck, the failure of the Weimar Republic, the nightmare of National Socialism, forty years of division, the Pandora’s box of unification, and Germany’s crucial role in the European Union. Students study the evolution of the German political system even as they develop the basic vocabulary of history and politics. Prerequisite:  or instructor permission. Offered every three years.370  Fables, Fairy Tales, and Parables  The focus of this course is on didactic literature: fables, fairy tales—many of which serve both to teach and to entertain (docet et delectat, the Latin dictum)—and the mod-ern-day parables of authors such as Franz Kafka. Prerequisite:  or instructor permission.380  Green Germany: Nature and Environment in German Culture  Being green is not a new trend for Germans. In fact, Germany has consistently led the way, not only within Europe but also throughout the world, in how to be environmentally friendly and natural resource conscious. Germany is (and has been) a world leader in solar and wind technologies and boasts one of the smallest carbon footprints of any industrialized major economy in the world. Why are Germans so green? What is Germany’s position on today’s major debates surrounding global warming, climate change, conservation, urban planning, public transportation, sustainable agriculture, and environmental protection? How do Germans see themselves vis-à-vis nature as represented in the arts? In this course students explore these and other questions related to nature and the environment from a German perspective, from the mid-eighteenth century through today. The course introduces students to a wide variety of subject matter and topics in literature, film, news items/current events, science, art, politics, language, and contemporary consumerism. The course also highlights the university city of Freiburg in Baden-Wuerttemberg, often called Germany’s greenest city, as a special case study. Prerequisite:  or instructor permission. Offered every three years.Advanced seminars taught in German Proficiency range: Intermediate High to Advanced Medium (ACTFL); B1-B2 (CEFR); 1+-2+ (ILR)405  Novellas of the 19th and early 20th Centuries  The history, the-ory, and development of the literary genre Novelle, featuring some of the more bizarre and fascinating works of the greatest German authors.

Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered every three years. 311  Ancient Comedy   This class surveys the surviving plays of Aristophanes, Menander, Plautus, and Terence. The class discusses the structural features of Old Comedy (such as the chorus and the paraba-sis), the canonical definitions of Old, Middle, and New comedy, as well as the revolution of style and taste that differentiates Menander from Aristophanes. In the mythic world of tragedy, mortal trespass results in tragic consequences. In comedy, on the other hand, the mortal realm—74     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Classicsflawed, confused, and rudely physical—arrives at the curtain both victorious and fecund. The class looks at the ways in which comedy transgresses social norms and the role of the carnivalesque in ancient culture. Students need not know Greek or Latin but must be willing to perform in front of their classmates. Offered every other year.318  Greek and Roman Religion   Students examine the religions of ancient Greece and Rome and the ways in which these religious sys-tems functioned within the context of their societies. “Religion” meant something very different to the Greeks and Romans than it does to modern Americans: it penetrated daily life, politics and law in ways that can seem foreign to us. The course utilizes literary, archaeological and artistic evidence to understand religious practices from the time of the Greek city-states to the establishment of Christianity as the Roman state religion. Topics covered include Greek and Roman conceptions of divinity, temples and sanctuaries, rituals, personal or family religion, gender roles within ancient religion, and the existence of mystery cults. Students read both primary and secondary works to understand Greek and Roman religion as a system of “things done” (ritual) and “things said” (prayer, myth, etc.) and discuss the extent to which it is proper to add the phrase “things believed.” Offered every three years.325  Sex and Gender in Classical Antiquity   This course examines sex, gender, and sexualities in ancient Greece and Rome. Building upon foundational readings in feminist and queer theory, this course examines critically both historical evidence for and representations of love, gender, sex, & sexuality in a wide range of ancient literary texts, as well as epigraphic, art historical, and archaeological sources. Through this combination of using both Greek and Roman primary sources and modern gender theory, this course aims to make sense of such topics as women’s lives, marriage, prostitution, sexual violence, medicine, pederasty, sex manuals, and non-normative or ‘Other’-bodied (e.g., transgendered) individuals. This course has no pre-requisites, but it is strongly recommended that you have taken at least one 200-level course in Classics or a course on gender theory (e.g., ). Offered every three years.334  The Archaeology of Power This course takes a large-scale approach to the archaeological remains of empires and states in the Mediterranean and Near East in the first millennium BCE. In this course, students learn, through studying material remains of various states and empires, how to (1) outline and investigate the diverse configurations, enactments, and experiences of power in human history, and (2) situ-ate the development of the Greek city-states and the Roman Empire within larger Mediterranean and Near Eastern imperial systems. Cultural groups to be considered include the Greeks and Romans as well as the Assyrians, Babylonians, Lydians, Phrygians, Persians, Egyptians, Israelites, Etruscans, and Phoenicians. Sources to be examined include the development and layout of cities as they relate to social stratification and power structures, funerary monuments, art and symbolism and their intersections with ideologies of power, the materiality of violence and re-sistance, and primary written sources in translation. As well, various theo-retical approaches to imperialism, colonialism, identity, and resistance are considered and evaluated. Overall, students will practice analyzing and evaluating both primary and secondary sources for the purposes of under-standing state and empire formation in the ancient world.  339   Sci-Fi, Fantasy, and the Classics  This course examines the an-cient history of the future and the might-have-been—the role of Greco-Roman antiquity in modern science fiction and fantasy. This course be-gins with discussion about definitions, histories, and theories of ‘science fiction’ and ‘fantasy,‘ with emphasis on their roots in and relations to ancient classics. Students then focus on representative modern texts in various media (e.g., short stories, novels, films, comics); such texts may include Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis, J. R. R. Tolkien’s The Hobbit, episodes of Star Trek, the works of Ridley Scott, or J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels. Students focus on themes of pe-rennial human significance (e.g., the uses of history, technology, fantastic voyages, metamorphosis, knowledge/wonder, etc.) and consider critical approaches that may help us understand more deeply the similarities and differences between classical and speculative thinking. To engage in this work, students will learn the basic concepts, tools, and research techniques of studies in the ‘classical tradition’ and ‘classical reception,’ a still-emergent but increasingly important field within the discipline of Classics.375  Special Topics in Classics  This seminar involves an in-depth ex-amination of selected topics in the classical world. A different topic may be selected each time the class is offered in accord with the interests of the students and the expertise of the faculty. Relevant theoretical approaches and current research are explored. Students are responsible for research papers and presentations under close supervision of the faculty. Prerequisite: two Classics courses numbered 200 or above, or permission of the instructor. Offered every third year or as needed. 390  Late Antiquity and the “Fall” of the Roman Empire   This course explores the world of Late Antiquity and the problem of the “fall” of the Roman Empire. Students encounter a variety of perspectives on this period, but examine in some detail the impact of Christianity on the Empire, the Germanic invasions into the Western Empire in the fourth and fifth centuries, and the place of “moral decadence” in theories about the fall of the Empire. Offered every third year. 490  Senior Thesis   This course is to be taken after both the required 200-level Classical Civilization courses and Latin or Greek 201 or equiva-lent have been completed. In the semester prior to registration for  (introductory survey)2. .327 Queer Cultures  Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer, ques-tioning (GLBTQ) are categories used to identify sub-groups within the queer community. Yet within these groups, or cultures, exist vastly complex and different experiences. In the struggle for social justice and equity, queers navigate the tension of remaining hidden—to fit into the dominant culture—versus being seen—to change the dominant culture. Main units include: “Science, Sexuality, and Ethics”, “Queering School Curricula”, “Marriage is a Queer Institution” and “The Disappearing Queer: Fear and Desire in Theory”. This course addresses questions such as: How are cultures constituted, experienced, and transformed? How can we interrogate category systems to understand framing assumptions and the ways categories position “majority” and “minori-tized” in social contexts? What is the relationship between taking a subversive stance and social transformation? Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Cross-listed with  recommended but not required.494  Gender Research Seminar   In this course students examine the differences between traditional scholarship and a feminist approach to knowing. Participants engage in an independent research project of their choosing, sharing process and findings with other members throughout the semester. Completion of the class includes participa-tion in the Lewis & Clark Undergraduate Gender Studies Conference in March of each year.  Prerequisite: , and at least one other course in the program. Offered every fall semester.495/496  Independent Study498  Internship Tutorial   Placement in a community or government agency dealing with social problems of particular relevance to gender, feminism, or sexuality, such as the Rainbow Center. Students develop an analysis of the group or agency’s work and make a public presenta-tion at the end of the semester. Taken during the senior year. Internship arranged through the Internship Office. Prerequisite: approval of the Gender and Queer Studies Director and the Internship Coordinator.GEOLOGYProfessor: Barry Goldstein; Jeffrey Tepper; Michael Valentine, ChairAssociate Professor: Kena Fox-Dobbs Instructor: Kenneth ClarkAbout the DepartmentThe Geology Department at Puget Sound consists of five faculty mem-bers and roughly 40 majors. Our size enables us to offer a broad spec-trum of classes while at the same time maintaining a close-knit and col-legial learning environment. All of our courses include a field component and these range from day or weekend trips to semester-long projects that integrate field and laboratory analysis. We also believe strongly in the importance of training our students to use analytical instrumentation and are very well-equipped in this regard. By the time they graduate our majors are scientists, trained to collect and interpret their own data, think creatively, and answer real-world questions. All members of the Geology faculty are actively engaged in research that involves our students. Our research interests span a broad range of topics including the environmental geochemistry of water and sediment from local water bodies, the glacial history of the Puget Sound area, paleomagnetic studies of variations in the earth’s magnetic field and past plate motions, the igneous and structural history of the Olympic Peninsula, stable isotope studies of past and present food webs, and the magmatic and tectonic evolution of the Pacific Northwest. Many of our projects are based here in the Pacific Northwest, but we have also taken students to more distant research locations including Alaska, the American Southwest, Ascension Island, New Zealand, and Africa.In both teaching and research we take advantage of outstanding facili-ties and equipment available in the department. Our resources include:• A Hitachi 3400 scanning electron microscope equipped with x-ray analysis and cathodoluminescence capabilities.• An Agilent 5100 ICP-capable of measuring elemental abundances at ppm levels and below in a wide variety of materials including rocks, water, and sediment.• A Phillips x-ray diffractometer for mineral analysis.• A Costech elemental analyzer for measuring C-H-N-S in soil, sedi-ment, and organic matter.• A completely equipped sample prep lab with facilities for cutting, crushing, and pulverizing rocks, making thin sections, and preparing mineral separates.• Separate, fully equipped labs for preparation and analysis of sam-ples for paleomagnetism, sedimentology, and geochemistry.• A wide array of field equipment including two boats, water, soil and sediment sampling gear, and GPS units.• A broad range of geophysical instruments including a gravimeter, magnetometer, electrical resistivity meter, and hammer seismo-graph.• Extensive collections of rocks, minerals, fossils, maps and other teaching materials.Students who major in geology learn to observe and interpret the natu-ral world. To that end, and to supplement our coursework and research opportunities, we take a departmental trip  lasting 10-14 days to an ex-citing location in alternate years. Our Summer 2015 tour was to Iceland; past trips have been to New Zealand, Tanzania, Ecuador, and Hawaii. Our majors develop the skills to formulate hypotheses, collect and interpret data, synthesize results, and present findings at professional conferences. All Geology majors have the option to complete a senior thesis. Upon graduation our students are ready to apply their knowledge and skills not only to academic topics, but also to important societal is-sues such as natural disaster planning, waste disposal, climate change, resource utilization, and water policy. Our graduates have gone on to a wide range of careers, the most popular in recent years being graduate school, environmental consulting, and teaching. However, we have graduates in 32 states and four foreign countries and their occupations include not only geologic fields (e.g., mineral exploration, hydrology, academia) but also other sciences and related professions (e.g., medicine, environmental law). General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. Requirements for the MajorGeology is the application of biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics to the study of the earth. Students majoring in Geology must understand the principles and techniques of these disciplines as well as the basic skills and concepts of geology. A Geology major consists of the following sequence of related courses: 1. Ten Geology units to include: a. One unit from "

Five additional units in the Department of History, or listed below, three of which must be taken at the 300 level.2. Students minoring in History must select courses from at least two of the following five areas of emphasis: African history, Asian history, European history, Latin American history, or United States history.3. The following courses can count toward a minor in History:  The Rise of European Civilization (Humanistic Approaches Core)"
HIST 102," Western Civilization: 1650-1990, 302, or 303 would be helpful preparation. Offered occasionally.312  The Apocalyptic Imagination  Apocalyptic visions of heaven, hell, judgment, cosmic battles, and a faithful, persecuted remnant have stimulated literary and religious imaginations for over 2000 years. The course explores the apocalyptic imagination within its historical and cul-tural context, acquaints students with the value systems and presuppo-sitions embedded in an apocalyptic perspective, and discerns the social structure and symbol system of an apocalyptic world-view. Offered occasionally.315 Modern Jewish Thinkers  This course acquaints students with major Jewish thinkers in the modern and contemporary periods. The course begins by asking what makes a thinker Jewish? What makes a Jewish thinker modern? After a brief overview of major themes in Jewish ethics, students begin their exploration with a study of Baruch Spinoza’s rationalist challenge to Judaism that results in the quintes-sential modern question, who is a Jew? Students then turn to Jewish Religious Studies186     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  responses to the Enlightenment, emancipation, nationalism, and new forms of antisemitism. These responses include a variety of Zionists, socialist Jews, existentialists such as Martin Buber, and mystics and social activists such as Abraham Joshua Heschel. The course then stud-ies post-Holocaust Jewish ethicists, Jewish feminists, and contending views on Jewish liberation. Offered occasionally.320  Reproductive Ethics  This course examines various religious, legal, and moral issues surrounding reproduction and  assisted repro-ductive technologies. It surveys how religious beliefs, doctrines, and practices have influenced patients¿ reproductive decisions, clinicians¿ medical decisions, and the reproductive healthcare system. The course analyzes tensions related to curtailing or enhancing fertility in the United States. Moral issues surveyed in this course include reproductive rights, contraception, abortion, prenatal diagnosis, assisted reproduction, sur-rogacy, genetic engineering in assisted reproduction, and the de-livery of reproductive healthcare. It also covers legal aspects of reproductive medicine. Students actively participate in discussion, debate, and role-playing based on assigned readings. Readings include religious texts, bioethics literature, feminist literature, and legal cases. Offered occasionally.321  Sexuality and Christianity: Then and Now   This course ap-proaches the subject of sexuality in the Christian tradition by focusing on three broad periods—early Christianity, the Middle Ages, and today. Within each era, students investigate questions of virginity, chastity, marriage, and non-normative sexualities (such as homosexuality). Students enlist a diverse selection of primary and secondary sourc-es—theoretical and historical. Through this fascinating exploration of Christianity and sexuality, students witness a dizzying variety of ways that sexualities have been lived, accepted, utilized, and interpreted. Furthermore, students develop a richer understanding of what sexuality has meant to Christianity over the ages and why it matters so much. Offered occasionally.328  Religion, the State, and Nationalism in Japan   This course ex-amines relationships between religious traditions, the “state,” and na-tionalism in Japanese history. Through careful study of primary and sec-ondary sources, the course explores early symbiosis between religious rites and governance; the role of Shinto and Buddhism in legitimating systems of government centered on the emperor or warrior elites; reli-gious components in modern Japanese imperialism; challenges to the separation of religion and the state in postwar Japan; civil religion; and cultural nationalism. Offered occasionally. 330  Religious Freedom in the United States   Should American religious history be told as story of increasing diversity and freedom? This course surveys the changing meanings of religious freedom in the United States from the early nation to the present day. Students con-sider key primary sources—founding documents, court cases, political cartoons, accusations, and apologetics-- and weigh these alongside the arguments of scholars in religious studies. These include historian William Hutchinson, who argues that pluralism in the United States is an ongoing legacy of the nation’s founders, as well as law professor Winifred Fallers Sullivan, who contends that the structures intended to protect religious expression have made religious freedom a practical impossibility. Students develop their own arguments in this debate through a research project that analyzes a historical or contemporary controversy over religious freedom. Offered occasionally.332  Buddhism   A study of the origin and development of Buddhism. Special emphasis is given to the history of Buddhist thought, the evo-lution of the primary schools of Buddhism, and the question of cultural influence on Buddhist expansion. Sources for study are drawn from Indian, Tibetan, Chinese, and Japanese texts in translation. Offered fre-quently.334  Vedic Religion and Brahmanism   This course examines the origin and development of religion in South Asian antiquity. Study focuses on the mythology and symbology of the Vedic textual corpus, the rise of ritual ideologies, and the meaning and influence of the yogic vision. In addition to Vedic texts, the course may include study of mythic epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana) and non-Vedic myths that appear in the Puranas. Students who have received credit for "

Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 300  Latina/o Literatures   Latino literary and cultural productions have particularly provided a gateway into understanding the heterogeneity of Latino experiences in the U.S. While this course does not survey Latino literatures historically, it does introduce students to some of the most contemporary Latina/o literary productions and cultural expressions by situating these in their broader cultural, social, and political frameworks. Plays, short stories, novels, testimonies, poetry, autobiography, essays, and film serve to explore complex –and often silenced– histories, is-sues and realities in present-day Latina/o communities. In this manner, the course looks at literature and cultural productions as a platform for cultural, social, individual, historical, and political expositions; a place where ideologies are contested, debated and articulated; a site where subjectivities are problematizadas, enunciated, and made visible. Central to this course are questions pertaining to: the neoliberal market and the commodification of the Latino body; identity construction (and/or destruction); the intersections of sexuality, gender, and class in in-forming discourse; racisms; discourses of privilege; language and art as a conduit for the erasure of invisibilities; the intersections of systems of power in the literary; border politics, death and violence in the Latino experience; conditions of exile and diaspora; U.S. immigration politics, and among others; defiant Latina/o sexualities.

Rather than assuming a universal model of the family, course readings examine families in the United States and elsewhere in the world as diverse entities shaped by economic and political factors, gender ideol-ogies, racial and class inequalities, sexual norms, and cultural changes. Family ideals frequently clash with contemporary family realities; social science is a powerful tool for illuminating the implications and meanings of family continuity and change.206  Theories of Deviance and Social Control   This course offers an in-depth exploration of multiple theories of deviance and social control. Each section of the class is organized around a particular theoretical orientation; each theory will elucidate both how deviance happens and the mechanism of social control that align with that particular theory. Every theory covered in this course is situated within a social, historical, and political context. Social and scientific theories are socially construct-ed, and thus, the context in which they emerge and exist is fundamental to their basic understanding. Students also learn how to use this diverse set of theories to make sense of how knowledge, power, and inequal-ities are all fundamentally tied to the ways in which a society comes to define and control deviance. As the semester progresses, students synthesize and integrate these theories to allow for a deeper, holistic understanding of deviance and social control. Prerequisite: .310  Critiquing Education Measuring students, norming test results, ranking students and schools, and “racing to the top” are endeavors that produce, according to a competitive paradigm, not only triumphant win-ners, but also deficient losers. Are there better, more inclusive and more socially just ways to envision and carry out the mission of education? How else might stigmatized students – those who are often perceived only as marginalized, “broken,” and in need of “fixing” – be seen and positively incorporated in school systems? This course explores these and related questions, using an anthropological approach to identify the possible riches as well as perceived liabilities “brought to school” by those students who often struggle disproportionately in most education-al systems. They include students whose biopsychological functioning is different enough for them to be labeled as “disabled”; students who are poor or have access to very limited economic resources; aboriginal students still negatively affected by their parents and grandparents hav-ing been forced to live far from family and home in residential boarding schools; and students whose home language is either a language other than English or a devalued variety of English. Class readings include both ethnographic accounts of such students’ lived experiences as well as investigations of various proposed policies of school reform.  312  Indonesia and Southeast Asia in Cultural Context   This course provides an anthropological overview of Southeast Asia, one of the most diverse and fascinating regions of the world, with a focus and required field component in Indonesia. Because of the Indonesia trip, the course requires an application and students are responsible for some expenses, including airfare. As a survey of Southeast Asian cultural groups and his-tories from an ethnographic perspective, the course begins on campus, but finishes in Yogyakarta, Central Java—a city often described as the cultural heart of Indonesia, and the country’s center of higher education. In the first section of the class students investigate the prehistory, ar-chaeology, and initial migration to the region. Students then examine the origins of agriculture and the development of complex state societies, and the influence of world religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, and particularly Islam) in the cultural development of SE Asia. Students then look at case Sociology and AnthropologyUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     195studies of ‘indigenous’ peoples in the region. Students also explore the economic and cultural impact of European colonialism and the response of SE Asian people to the European presence, as well as the post-co-lonial period of nation building. The final section of the course is more geographically focused, and looks at the cultural component of many im-portant issues in modern day Indonesia, including environmental decline and deforestation, the impact of globalization and industrialization, the problems of ethnic and religious minorities, and human rights concerns. Students develop individual research projects that incorporate both library research and ethnographic fieldwork while in Indonesia. The Indonesia portion of the course lasts approximately 18 days, beginning shortly after the semester ends, and features an immersive stay at a local university including language instruction, guest lectures by Indonesian scholars, trips to cultural and historic sites, ethnographic projects, a multi-night stay in a rural village, and potential trips to Bali or other neighboring islands. Puget Sound students stay in the dorms alongside Indonesian students, some of whom sit in on class sessions and help introduce the visitors to their culture and lifestyle through group activities. Two faculty members accompany the group, and course meetings continue abroad, while taking advantage of the Indonesian setting with ethnographic assignments and individualized research projects developed prior to departure. The course is limited to 10-12 students and requires an application and instructor permission. There are fees related to the trip, including the plane ticket.  Contact the course instructor for more information. Prerequisite: , application, and permission of instructor. NOTE: This course will re-quire an 18-day field component in Indonesia, and will require students to pay their own airfare, as well as other potential program fees. Applications will be accepted from all students who have met the prerequisite of  (Cultural Anthropology), and a panel of two faculty members (the instructor and one other member from Sociology and Anthropology or the Asian Studies Program) will evaluate applications on the basis of: (1) academic performance, (2) well-articulated ability/willingness to deal with adverse situations and cultural difference, (3) recommendations by Puget Sound faculty members, (4) interest and enthusiasm for study in and about Southeast Asia, and (5) a clean disciplinary record at the university. 314  Criminology  The field of criminology covers two main areas: (1) analysis of law-breaking and (2) investigation of the ways in which laws are made and enforced by the criminal justice system. The first seeks to answer the question, Why do people break (or follow) the law?  The second asks, How is (criminal) law made and enforced? These issues are examined historically and cross-nationally but there is particular at-tention given to contemporary conditions in the United States, a country with a high rate of offending and probably the highest rate of incarcer-ation in the world. In addition to investigating the variation in offending and victimization, the course examines the extent to which the U.S. criminal justice system is biased against certain classes and groups. Offered occasionally.315  Identity Politics in Latin America   This course explores the rise of identity politics within Latin America since the 1990s. It asks how ethnic, racial, feminist, sexual, and transnational identity politics have shaped the nature and goals of a diverse array of social movements in the region. It draws on ethnographic analyses to analyze how specific instances of identity politics emerged from particular historical and national contexts to challenge traditional hierarchies of power in new ways. The course also utilizes fictional, testimonial, and film sources for further investigation of the experiences of participants within these movements and their implications for transformations in Latin American society.

Technology has powerfully shaped and altered human experience. In this course, students examine what is technology, how is our relation-ship with technology changing, how does technology shape our modern culture and, in turn, how does our culture shape our technology. Topics covered may include: the industrial revolution, the airplane, Julia Child’s kitchen, the Chernobyl disaster, and the development of the internet. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.  Offered every other year.310  I, Robot—Humans and Machines in the 20th and 21st Centuries   In the mid 20th century, science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov envisioned the world in 2029 filled with complex and autonomous machines, capable of caring for children and engaging in interplanetary travel, mining, and political and military action. In contrast to this fictional world, how and why did the real inventors of computers, cybernetics, and robotic machin-ery create these technologies? What future(s) did they imagine for their inventions, and how did they understand the relationship between hu-mans and machines? Did they envision an Asimovian future or something completely different? Did these technologies challenge them to re-think what it means to be human? Why or why not? In this course, students investigate the history of these fields to develop a better understanding of technology, society, and values in the 20th and 21st centuries. Offered every other year.324  Science and Race: A History   This course examines the history of ideas about race in biology since the eighteenth century. Students study how and why knowledge about race has been constructed and used in particular contexts, and, in doing so, examine the complex relationship be-tween science and society. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.325  Highway to History: A Study of the Automobile Industry   Although inventors in different countries and time periods contributed to the invention of the automobile, the car remains a symbol of American engineering and technological prowess, personal independence, adult-hood, and social status. This course examines the intellectual and social history of the automobile in the United States and abroad. By analyzing cars as products of a large technological system, including, for example, tire manufacture, oil and gas production, road construction, gas stations, and a variety of other ancillary industries, this class investigates the social, economic, environmental, and cultural impacts of the automobile. Offered every other year.344  Ecological Knowledge in Historical Perspective  This course examines the history of both scientific ecology and recent movements to interrogate, question, and revise the West’s understanding of nature, including Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). In doing so the course places both defenses and critiques of Western science in historical context, with particular emphasis on potential implications for envi-ronmental policy. Students examine how the rise of conservation and environ-mentalism, responses to imperialism and colonialism, and de-bates over the role of activism and advocacy in science have influenced ecologists’ work, identity, and organizations. In doing so students study the interaction between science and society, while considering the im-portant insights a historical understanding of science can bring to under-standing modern concerns and controversies. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.347  Better Living Through Chemistry   “Better things for better liv-ing…through chemistry” was a popular slogan used by DuPont in the mid-to-late twentieth century to market laboratory-developed products. Increasingly, concerns have been raised about the merits and conse-quences of chemicals in our food, goods, and environment. This class an-alyzes how we know what we know about chemistry, and how studies of the very small shape fundamental questions about the world, e.g. what is natural, what is artificial, does the difference matter, and if so in what con-texts?  By investigating a series of historical episodes that highlight some of the key intellectual, social, and political challenges of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this course examines how we learn about, modify, and relate to our environment chemically. From the development of the periodic table to the study of pollution, this course encourages stu-dents to gain an appreciation for the science of chemistry while engaging in cross-disciplinary dialogue about ways in which chemistry affects our daily lives. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.350  Interdisciplinary Study of Science and Technology  This seminar is required of all majors and minors in STS, but is  also open to all stu-dents interested in the relationships between science, technology and society. Students study various approaches developed by historians, so-ciologists and philosophers of science and technology. The methods and approaches learned in this course provide a foundation for the STS Senior Seminar, in which stu-dents complete a substantial research project on a topic of their choice. For non-majors, the course offers an overview of how and why scholars have studied science and technology in different ways, and also provides an opportunity to practice thinking, talking and writing about science beyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. Prereq:  or , 202 and 350. Offered every Spring starting Spring 2022.490  Senior Seminar   This seminar is required of all majors and minors in STS, and is offered in the Fall of each year.

How have people in different times and contexts made sense of health, disease, and healing? How have changing conceptions of nature and the scientific study of the human body influenced medicine? What have been the social, political, and institutional contexts in which medicine has been done and developed? How has the role of the doctor and patient relationship changed, and how have conceptions of a “good doc-tor” and “good medicine” changed? How have the problems of access to and distribution of medical care been approached? Examining each of these questions in historical context will, in turn, provide a foundation UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     191Science, Technology, and Society/Sociology and Anthropologyfor contemplating modern issues in medical research and practice, as well as medicine’s place in modern society. Offered every other year. 378  Weapons of Mass Destruction   During World War I, teams of chemists, engineers, and military leaders in Germany, France, the United States and elsewhere worked to prepare chemical weapons that could be deployed on battlefields. The field use of chemical weapons proved to be difficult and unreliable so they were little used as combat weapons in World War II, though related chemicals were key tools of the Nazi holocaust. Chemical weapons have also been deployed often in smaller conflicts, including very recently. If the first world war was the chemists’ war, the second was the physicists’ and led to the development and use of nuclear weapons. Fortunately, there has not yet been a biologists’ war, although germ warfare has been an active area of research by national governments. In the period after World War II, international efforts at controlling weapons of mass de-struction, preventing their proliferation to other nations, and protecting stockpiles from falling into unauthorized hands has proved to be dif-ficult and complicated. In this course students become familiar with the history of weapons of mass destruction and analyze humanitarian, political, and geopolitical arguments about their development and pos-sible use. Students also learn to evaluate strategies for their control.

The program offers a general introductory course in neuroscience as an elec-tive for all students, and also offers an interdisciplinary minor that may serve as an enhancement of, or complement to, any major of a student’s choice. This interdisciplinary minor provides additional opportunities for students to develop skills necessary to become successful scientists and is recognized with a designation on the transcript upon graduation. Participation in the minor by both faculty and students facilitates involve-ment in broader neuroscience topics and contributes to a sense of com-munity across departments. A key feature of this program is a research or internship experience in the field. Involving students in research with fac-ulty not only broadens their knowledge and training in brain sciences, but also kindles an interest in and an appreciation for the methodological, phil-osophical, and ethical issues with which neuroscientists are concerned. This additional experience significantly improves the training of our stu-dents as they prepare for entry into careers in basic research, health care, secondary teaching, and public policy. Additionally, the Neuroscience Program is a part of a consortium of Northwest Liberal Arts Colleges of-fering Neuroscience experiences. pugetsound.edu/neuroscienceRequirements for the Minor in Neuroscience1..

Offered occasionally.105  Oceanography   Earth is largely a “water planet”—the only planet we know of that has liquid water on its surface. Oceanography has de-veloped from early mythological explanations of the seas to the present use of high technology to study their features and workings. The oceans played an integral role in the exploration of Earth and the spread of hu-mankind across the planet, as well as being a continuing source of food and other resources. In the Puget Sound region, we feel the effects of the nearby ocean daily, from the weather we have to the food we eat. This course investigates the origins and nature of Earth’s oceans. It looks at processes acting within the oceans (tides, currents, waves), interaction of the oceans, atmosphere, and continents, and the effects of these processes on life on Earth, including humans in the northwest-ern U.S. These facets are studied in the “big picture” context of the Earth as an integrated system in which each process affects the others. A portion of the lab time is devoted to measurement of the properties of oceanic and crustal material, some of which are collected locally from Puget Sound. Other labs are used to familiarize students with maps, charts, and other information sources. Emphasis is placed on making inferences about Earth systems from data gleaned from students’ own measurements and other sources. One weekend field trip is required. Satisfies the Natural Scientific Approaches core requirement. Usually offered every year.110  Regional Field Geology   This course focuses on one of several geo-logic provinces in North America in the most direct manner possible—in the field.

More precisely it analyzes the roles of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), corporations and social entrepreneurs. The course addresses a number of issues: What do NGOs do and how to they finance their operations? Can multinational corporations play a role in the fight against global poverty and, if so, how? How can we make sense of so-called “social enterprise”? What is the role of the state in regulating and en-couraging private solutions to poverty? Are these private solutions fur-ther proof of economic liberal dominance or a move toward a new form of capitalism tailored to serve social needs? Offered frequently.323 The Political, Economic, and Social Context of International Tourism   In the contemporary world, tourism is often the foremost process that brings  together people from different parts of the world, allowing those from vastly different societies to interact on a face-to-face basis under peaceful, if not always equal, circumstances. As such, tourism as a phenomenon and as a process raises questions about glob-al interconnections and global movements of finance, cultural and mate-rial artifacts, ideas, and people across national and cultural boundaries. The two questions this course addresses throughout the semester are 1) what are the economic, political, social, cultural, and environmental impacts of tourism in low and middle income countries? and 2) what are the tradeoffs associated with tourism?  In tackling these two questions the course examines a wide range of issues, including the political, eco-nomic, social, and cultural implications of tourism, the impact of global tourism on environmental and global conservation efforts, and tourism as a vehicle of social change and as a facilitator of cultural and material globalization.

Specific policy issues such as refugee and asylum policy, border enforcement, immigration detention, and birthright citizen-ship are considered. Offered occasionally.308  Images of Corruption in U.S. Politics   This course explores many visions of the corruption of the American republic, exploring concerns grounded in the liberal and civic republican and constitutional traditions, commitments to and deviations from the core commitments of the American “creed,” religious values, pluralism, the partisan and ideological “spirit of faction,” and the abandonment of the hope that, to borrow from Richard Rorty (through James Baldwin), we can “achieve” a country. The reading list includes books that engage broad themes in American politics and American political development, and this course exposes students to those themes while working through the multifaceted meanings of corruption, and the political consequences of these perceptions of corruption. Prerequisite: , Junior or Senior Standing. Offered occasionally. 309  U.S. Presidency  This course focuses on the US presidency.  In the first part of the course students read two great books on the presiden-cy and the American political system, Richard Neustadt’s Presidential Power and Stephen Skowronek’s The Politics Presidents Make as tools for understanding the evolution of the presidency as an institution and its relationship to the larger constitutional system. In the second half of the course students trace the growth of presidential power over the course of US history, focusing on executive management of the bureau-cratic state and control of foreign affairs, and consider the implications  of this development for the republic.  Prerequisite: .  Offered every other year.310  Presidency and Congress   The course focuses on the historical development of the legislative and executive branches, focusing on the interactions between Congress and presidents in policy making process. Some offerings of the course focus heavily on the presidency, and others are more focused on Congress; recent offerings have used a single presidency as a long case study of problems in presidential leadership and the workings of the legislative and executive branches.

They provide citizens with the opportunity to choose their leaders, and in the process pass judg-ment on the past performance of officials and broadly indicate the direction they want government to take in the future. This course approaches the study of parties, elections, and campaigns through the lens of presidential and congressional elections, focusing on the purpose, process, and prob-lems of electing our nation’s leaders. It looks at how the system works, how it came to be, what citizens want it to accomplish and what it in fact accomplishes, and what the possibilities and limits of reform may be. At the end of the course, students should be able to give an in-depth, well rea-soned, and historically informed answer to the question, “Is this any way to run a democracy?” Prerequisite: .

This course examines this gloomy conventional wisdom, exploring its analyti-cal and ideological roots and its critique of American political institutions and public policy. The class then interrogates it, first by examining con-trary arguments and evidence and then in a series of student-led case studies of government performance in specific policy areas. Students produce major term papers that assess the successes and failures of some public policy. The course aims at helping students to come to grips with the complexities of policymaking, the strengths and weak-nesses of national governmental institutions, and the extent to which the pessimism that marks so much of contemporary political discourse is justified. Prerequisite: . Offered every other year. 315  Law and Society   This course introduces students to the nature, functions, and processes of law.

Students examine the classical theories of eighteenth and nineteenth century political economy and political sociology (Smith, Marx, Spencer, Durkheim, Weber), post-WWII neo-classical theories of modernization and development, and theoretical approaches at the global level in the wake of the collapse of the dominant modernization paradigm. Students then apply these theories to contemporary puzzles of political economic change and address the broader issue of the growth of knowledge in the social sciences. Prerequisite: , 103, or permission of instructor. Offered every other year.339  The Politics of Empire   Empires have existed since the pre-mod-ern era, and until the mid-twentieth century imperial states were the dominant form of government. Today, no state refers to itself as an em-pire—yet the term is still widely used. Some call modern American for-eign policy “imperialist.” Other react that American power is a stabiliz-ing force. The purpose of this course is to examine critically the meaning of the term “empire.” What do empires have in common? What are the political causes of empire, and what are its effects on the colonizer and the colonized? What are the common attributes of this form of gover-nance across time and space? Is economic dominance without political conquest “imperial” in any meaningful sense of the word? If the United States has an empire, what exactly does this mean? Do American interactions with other peoples reflect earlier patterns of imperial domi-nance, or do users of the term “empire” (perhaps willfully) mischaracter-ize the phenomenon of benign American hegemony? Students attempt to answer these questions through critical examination of historical forms of empire and contemporary accounts of American political and economic policy. Students should complete .

Politics and Government176     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  355  Comparative State Politics  State governments are often over-looked, however, states wield tremendous  power over the daily lives of citizens. A citizen’s life can look very different depending on what state she lives in. The course takes a comparative approach to understand this critical level of U.S. politics. Why is marijuana legal in some states and not others? Why are the systems of public education so different? A comparative look allows students to ask why states respond differently to similar policy questions, considering the potential role of historical, cultural, economic and political contexts as well as variations in institu-tional arrangements. After delving into factors that alter the political op-portunity structures in states, students turn to case studies. Looking at particular states and particular policy issues allows one to see how and why politics and political outcomes vary across states. Offered every other year. 360  Israel, Palestine and the Politics of the Middle East  This course focuses on the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and the relationship between this conflict and the politics of the Middle East.  The course will begin with an overview of the emergence of the Israeli state, and the competing national identities of the Palestinian and Israel people.  The subsequent wars between Israel and its neighbors will also be considered, as well as the emergence of terrorism as a political tool.  This will be followed by an analysis of the peace process between Israel, the Palestinians and neighboring states, as well as the domestic institutions and issues within Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza.  The course will conclude with a discussion of the obstacles to peace between Israelis and Palestinians and between Israel and other.

For some, the connections between food and the larger environmental and social systems that sustain human life are largely invisible. This experiential course explores these interactions through an extensive and intensive investigation of the Northwest food system from farm to fork. For three weeks, the course travels among the campuses of Whitman College, the University of Puget Sound, and Willamette University, tracing the themes of soil, labor, and money across the Northwest foodscape. Beginning at Whitman, students focus on the political economy of the food system, training a global lens on the industrial wheat farms, chicken processing plants, and large-scale dairy operations of the Walla Walla Valley.  At the University of Puget Sound, the focus shifts to urban agriculture and food justice, tracing the three themes through questions of poverty and ac-cess to food, urban planning, and the challenges of growing food in the city of Tacoma. Finally, the course concludes at Willamette where stu-dents will live and work at Zena Forest and Farm, putting the methods of sustainable agriculture into practice and exploring the opportunities and obstacles associated with smaller-scale organic agriculture in the Willamette Valley.

Is it a tool of the powerful, or a safeguard against exploitation? In short, does international law matter? This course draws on primary source materials (cases and treaties) and scholarly articles to examine the processes of international law as seen from the perspective of politically motivated actors. Readings examine broad the-oretical issues pertaining to international law as well as the functioning of international legal regimes in specific issue areas such as trade, hu-man rights, and the environment. Students apply political science meth-odologies in an attempt to understand and explain the behavior of states and non-state actors as they engage in a competition to create, enforce, and resist international law. Students should complete  and have a familiarity with international relations theory and social science meth-odologies prior to taking the course. Prerequisite: .

All have potential for generating violent conflict in the world today. Prerequisite: . Offered every year.336  Terrorism   This course examines the phenomenon of terrorism on many different dimensions. First, it explores what is meant by the term “terrorism,” and the question of “Is one man’s terrorist another man’s freedom fighter?” Next, the class considers why certain groups turn to terror. What do they hope to accomplish and how does terrorism help them achieve their goals? The course then looks at various examples of terrorism and strategies to combat it. Is terrorism best fought like a mili-tary conflict or like an international crime? How can states hope to protect themselves? Ethical issues are also addressed, such as how the needs of national security are balanced against the requirements of civil liberties in a free, democratic society. Finally, the course considers the War on Terror itself, analyzing its strategies and tools and assessing its purpose and efficacy. Prerequisite: . Offered occasionally. 338  Constitutional Law of U.S. National Security   The course exam-ines the constitutional law of U.S. national security policy. It explores classic constitutional issues, such as separation of powers, war powers of the President and Congress, intelligence operations, and treaty-mak-ing, as well as contemporary policy issues, such as domestic wiretap-ping, and the internment and trial of suspected terrorists. Prerequisite:  and have a basic familiarity with international relations theory and social science method-ologies prior to taking the course. Prerequisite:  or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.340  Democracy and the Ancient Greeks   This course examines an-cient Athenian political philosophy and applies the questions raised in those texts to contemporary political challenges. In light of the ideas, words, and deeds of thinkers from ancient Greece, students ask them-selves: “how shall we live, and what shall we do in our time?” Thinkers studied typically include Homer, Thucydides, Aristotle, and Plato. The course also explores Greek satire and tragedy. Offered every third year.341  Liberalism and its Critics   This course examines the theoretical foundations of liberalism and radical critiques of it from both the left and the right. In addition to exploring the political implications of the various Politics and GovernmentUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     175conceptions of nature, human nature, justice, freedom, and equality found in the works of various thinkers, students use their arguments to reflect on contemporary liberal democratic theory and practice. Thinkers studied typically include Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Marx, Nietzsche, and others. Credit for  or 104 and one additional PG course.  Offered every other year.387  Just War Theory  This course considers the evolution of the idea of morally justifiable warfare, primarily in the Western context. Students trace just war theory from the ancient world to the present day, with attention to both religious and secular theoretical texts. The course en-courages students to think about recent and contemporary international relations through the lens of just war theory.  Prerequisite:   or 104.  Offered every other year. 390  Gender and Philosophy   This course is a study of a number of philosophical and political questions related to gender and with the relation between these two types of questions. The course will be concerned first, with metaphysical issues concerning gender: What is gender? How many genders are there? Is there an essence of woman-hood or manhood that goes beyond certain physical characteristics? Are ‘woman’ and ‘man’ purely natural categories or are they to some extent socially constructed? Is gender a social/political concept? Second, with epistemological issues that relate to gender difference: Do women, for example, see the world differently from men? What kind of implications does this have for scientific and philosophical knowledge? Are there, for example, specifically female ways of thinking or reasoning? If so, to what extent are they marginalized? Do gender related values or political aims affect scientific knowledge? Finally, with ethical issues related to gender: What is gender oppression? What is sexism and heterosexism? Granted that everyone has an equal right to flourishing regardless of gender, is a woman’s flourishing, for example, different from a man’s? Are there specifically gendered roles for men and women? To what ex-tent are we culturally biased when we think that women or those who don’t conform to gender norms living in other cultures are oppressed?

How should society be governed? What is the good life? Questions like these, while abstract and philosophical, underpin all international political disputes, and understanding them is a first step towards resolving the conflicts inherent in international relations. This course seeks to draw connections between the problems of interna-tional politics and the world of political philosophy. It traces the history of political thought, from ancient Greece and its protean ideas of both realism and idealized governance through the hard-nosed politics of Machiavelli and Hobbes and the modernized idealism of Kant and Grotius up to the present-day thinking of such international relations scholars as Morgenthau, Waltz, and Walzer. In doing so, the class ex-plores the connections linking political thinking and events across time, taking lessons from different times and applying them to the problems of today. The course concludes by examining four case studies of real policy problems, including humanitarian intervention, the role of interna-tional law, and the invasion of Iraq, through the lens of political theory. Prerequisite: . Offered every other year.344  American Political Thought   In the words of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, “Europe was created by history; America was created by philosophy.” The history and character of the United States cannot be understood without careful examination of the ideas, theories, and philosophies that underpin the American nation. This course examines the various strands of American political thought, beginning with the early political thought of the Puritans. Much attention is paid to the theories that unite the United States, such as the adoption of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, as well as those ideas that have divided the nation, such as race and slavery during the Civil War. The course concludes by considering the enduring tensions in American liberalism and the modern civil rights era. Offered every other year. 345  Politics and Community Engagement   This course in politi-cal theory prepares students for active participation in local politics. Students develop both a theoretical understanding of political participa-tion and a set of practical skills to enable them to work actively within their communities. Through the study of theories of participation, pow-er, and justice, students explore the ethical and political challenges of undertaking community and political organizing. At the same time, stu-dents gain practical skills for undertaking community engagement work; they have real opportunities to communicate with diverse community partners on issues of mutual concern, to conduct power analysis, and to identify strategies for political engagement. Offered occasionally. 346  Race in the American Political Imagination   Students explore the concepts of citizenship and personhood in the American political imagination as filtered through a racial valence. Perhaps what is most striking about this valence is the way that it—and Americans’ concep-tions of whiteness, citizenship, and personhood—has evolved through America’s history. Students will consider what role such images play in constructing a “shared” political community, and to what extent the exclusions they engender strengthen or undermine this community. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered every third year. 347  Comparative Political Ideologies  Can ideologies, when put into practice, live up to the utopian dreams of their visionaries? Or will they degenerate into dystopian nightmares?  In this course in political theory, students study many of the ideologies that have shaped politics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. They explore the core theoretical texts of nationalist, anarchist, socialist, liberal, and Islamist movements, including Marx, Mao, Mussolini, Qutb, and others. Finally, they reflect on the (perhaps utopian) ideals that shape these movements and on how those ideals have influenced politics and political arrangements. Offered every other year.348  Philosophy of Law   This course is concerned with the nature of law and the relationship between law and morality. The course is cen-tered on questions like the following: What is the connection between law and morality? Is it morally wrong to break the law? Is breaking the law sometimes morally permissible or even morally required? Should morality be legally enforced? To what extent, if at all, should legal decisions be influenced by moral beliefs? What are the relationships between legal, constitutional, moral, and political rights? How can le-gal punishment be morally justified? While pursuing answers to these questions through the work of leading legal philosophers, students read a number of actual court cases and discuss specific issues like hate speech, homosexuality, and capital punishment, among others. Crosslisted as  or 340-347). 349  Contemporary Issues in Political Theory   This course explores contemporary issues in political theory related to questions of citizenship, membership, and power. Students reflect on the structures and prac-tices that determine who wields power, who holds citizenship status, who counts as a member of a political community.  Students might also explore the relationship between economic and political arrangements. Prerequisite: by instructor permission only. Students who receive credit for "

This course provides an overview of a sociological perspective on gender, with close attention to the relational construction of gender difference through analyzing both femininities and masculinities, as well as how gender intersects with other differences such as race, class, ethnicity, and sexuality. The first half of the course examines gender inequality from several classic and contemporary theoretical perspectives. The second half foregrounds empirical research on gender and how gender works and changes over time in institutions that affect our daily lives such as schools, families, and workplaces. Readings focus on the United States as well as other countries within our increasingly globalized world. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement.Sociology and AnthropologyUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     193213  City and Society   More than half of all humans on earth now dwell in cities, and urban life is almost certainly an integral aspect of our collective future.  This course introduces students to the sociological and anthropological study of the city through an examination of the theories, concepts, and frameworks social scientists have deployed in seeking to understand cities. This examination includes a focus on urbanization, or the underlying processes by which cities emerge, and on urbanism, or the character of life in an urban built environment. The geographical focus of the class ranges from global cities in other parts of the world to the American cities with which students are familiar.  This course includes a fieldwork component that requires students to explore the themes they encounter over the semester in the urban con-text of Tacoma.215 Race and Ethnic Relations   The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the forms of difference and inequality reflected, con-structed, and reproduced through notions of race and ethnicity.  It asks: what are the forms of knowledge, practices, institutions, and values that have informed the nature and meaning of race and ethnic relations in both the US context and globally? Using a historical, theoretical, and comparative approach, the course examines both the origins of con-temporary race and ethnic categories and the way those categories have been reconfigured and deployed over time and space as part of diverse political, social, and economic projects. Drawing on specific cases, students explore how notions of race and ethnicity intersect with other forms of difference, such as class, gender, and national identity. Through engagement with sociological/anthropological analyses of race and ethnic difference, the course thus provides students with a concep-tual and theoretical toolbox with which to critically examine contempo-rary race and ethnic relations and engage in informed debate about their implications. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 217  International Research Proposal Workshop   0.25 activity unit.   This course is designed to guide students through the process of pre-paring and submitting a proposal for independent research in a foreign/international setting. The course functions as a workshop: students iden-tify potential funding sources, develop relevant proposals, refine those proposals in a collaborative workshop setting, and coordinate with Puget Sound Fellowships Office when appropriate. The class meets monthly, and enrollment is limited. Prerequisite: permission from instructor.225  Asian Medical Systems  A basic introduction to three traditional medical systems of Asia: Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and Tibetan medicine. The course examines theoretical underpinnings, trainings of practitioners, materials and techniques utilized in treatment, and import-ant historical developments in each system. Additionally, the course explores issues of the interface between biomedicine and these sys-tems, and larger issues of globalization in the practice and consumption of traditional medicines. Taking an anthropological approach, the course aims to understand each system from within itself while also paying close attention to the social and cultural conditions under which each system has thrived and has also faced challenges. The course examines how systems of healing are both biologically and culturally based, and considers how these medical systems relate to issues of national identi-ty and global politics.230  Indigenous Peoples: Alternative Political Economies   This course examines the situations, problems, and continually developing strategies of indigenous peoples living in various countries and regions scattered throughout the world. While the central concern of this in-vestigation focuses on so-called “tribal” peoples and their increasingly threatened, yet still instructive lifeways, the course also deliberately considers selected points of contrast and comparison involving “mod-ern” societies as well. Toward this end, the course uses the approach of political anthropology, which has traditionally been associated with the study of small-scale societies (wherein the realms of “politics” and “economics” are inseparably interlinked with other sociocultural institu-tions such as “religion” and “kinship”). The ultimate aim of the course is threefold: first, to acknowledge the tragedy of past and presently-con-tinuing destruction of indigenous peoples’ physical, social, and cultural lives; second, to learn about and from the resilience and resistance such people have shown over millennia; and third, to inspire hope that it is still not too late for “modern” and “tribal” people humbly and profitably to learn from each other. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally; offered Fall 2012.235  Linguistic Anthropology  This course is an introduction to the sub-discipline of linguistics within the broader discipline of anthro-pology. The course covers methods used and theories formulated in the study of language in anthropology. These include the structure of language; language through history; a comparison between human and non-human modes of communication; the innate human capacity for language; the relationship between language, thought, and culture; and the study of language, power, and identity. A cross-cultural perspective is emphasized in this class. Offered occasionally.240  Social Movements  This course surveys major theories and research on social movements. Issues of recruitment, organization, tactics, resource mobilization, the role of the mass media, the impact of official agencies, and effects on public policy are examined. Selected movements are analyzed in relation to political institutions, socioeco-nomic structures, and cultural trends. Among the movements studied: the civil rights movement, women’s movement, environmental move-ment, labor movement, right-wing movements, the pro- and anti-abor-tion movements, and popular liberation movements in the Third World. Offered occasionally.280  Archaeological Foundations  As one of the four fields of anthro-pology, archaeology seeks to uncover artifacts and the material culture of human life in order to understand past civilizations and the long-term development of human societies across space and time. This course offers an introduction to the field of archaeology, providing an overview of its goals, theory, methods, and ethics. Students have the opportunity to learn and practice basic archaeological techniques, as well as to reflect on the significance of these techniques for understanding other peoples. Through study of specific cases, students are also exposed to some of the major debates that have shaped the field including, for example, questions of artifact authenticity, ownership, and repatriation; the reliabil-ity of diverse forms of knowledge and methods; the origins, evolution, and diffusion of human cultures; and the impact of new technology on archeological methods. Offered every other year.295  Social Theory   This course offers an in-depth survey of sociolo-gy’s foundational theoretical perspectives. Students analyze, compare, and apply the ideas of a range of classic and contemporary social theo-rists, and in doing so develop a keen appreciation for how the lens we use to think about and perceive various social phenomena profoundly shapes our questions and conclusions about the world. The course focuses on the kinds of questions that have been asked by influential nineteenth- and twentieth-century thinkers, as well as the theories they have constructed to answer them. The first half of the course focuses on the “classical” theorists, including Marx, Durkheim, and Weber. The second half is devoted to several contemporary perspectives that build on and extend the classical theories, including feminist theory, Goffman, Sociology and Anthropology194     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Bourdieu, and Foucault. The idea of “emancipation” is used as a heuris-tic tool for thinking through a range of social theories.296  Anthropological Theory   Anthropological theory sees the world through a disciplinary lens that focuses on culture—shared understand-ings—while looking broadly and holistically at the human condition across a broad range of times and places. This course invites students to “think anthropologically” as they become familiar with the various lines of thought that have characterized anthropology since its earliest days to the present. In addition, students also learn to grapple theoreti-cally with a contemporary problem and articulate their thoughts on the issues in terms of relevant anthropological theorists. Examples of prob-lems that could be considered in the course include the following: the issue of “ownership” of indigenous culture, the unresolved problems of multiculturalism, or the interrelationships linking globalization, terrorism, and genocide. The course involves heavy reading demands and is con-ducted seminar style with students expected to lead and contribute to class discussions on a daily basis. 298  Social Research   This course covers experimental and quasi-ex-perimental design, the design of social surveys, and techniques of data analysis appropriate for each type of design. Individual student research projects are required. Prerequisites:  or 102 or permission of instructor.299  Ethnographic Methods   Ethnography is the study of human cul-tures. Ethnographic methods are the constellation of research methods that anthropologists (and nowadays, many others) use in exploring, understanding, and writing about human cultures. This course introduc-es students to the methodological craft of ethnographic inquiry, and includes an examination of the historical development of this method-ological toolkit, the theoretical implications of this approach to research, the ethical considerations paramount to ethnographic research, and the practical concerns involved in “doing” ethnography. Students will have the opportunity to practice and deploy these research methods in fieldwork settings in the greater Tacoma area. The course is structured around the design and implementation of an independent research proj-ect that utilizes these methods for anthropological inquiry. Prerequisites:  or 102 or permission of instructor.301  Power and Inequality   This course examines social and econom-ic inequality in the United States and globally. The goal of the course is to understand the extent of inequality as well as the power structures that systematically distribute resources in a particular way. The course introduces concepts and theoretical approaches that are fundamen-tal to the social sciences. The policy implications that emerge from these comparisons are also discussed. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement. Prerequisites:  or 102 or per-mission of instructor.305  Heritage Languages and Language Policies   Using the perspec-tives of linguistic anthropology and sociolinguistics, this course inves-tigates not only languages and the people who speak them, but also some of the ideologies and policies (in schools, government, and work) that impinge on issues of language rights and practice. Beginning with a comparative consideration of the semantic “load” carried by several specific key words in different languages/cultures, the course proceeds to examine the larger theme of language loss, looking in particular at endangered indigenous languages. Complementing this focus on the threat faced by “small” languages around the world, the course also considers examples of systematic efforts, on the part of native speakers and policy makers, to affirm linguistic diversity in multicultural societies, exploring in this connection such topics as bilingualism and diglossia (including Ebonics and Creoles). The course ends with a critical look at some of the rhetoric, ideologies, and policies geared to promote or chal-lenge monolingualism in the U.S. 308  Visual and Media Anthropology  Students focus on visual an-thropology in its primary and original form: as a research practice. Specifically, they investigate and practically explore the use of visual media as a tool for anthropological research and presentation. They dis-cuss visual anthropology both as a supplement to textually-focused eth-nography, and as an end in itself, in the creation of a visual product that explicates cultural realities. This course focuses on visual forms of com-munication by analyzing and questioning how facts travel in the world through old and new media such as film, video, photography, including their digital forms. Students are introduced to the history of ethnograph-ic film and contemporary changes that have widened the possibilities of visual anthropology beyond its early confines as a tool for illustration. Critical theory, methods, and ethical concerns are all part of the current refashioning of visual anthropology and are critical components of the class. Students will also be introduced to the emerging sub-discipline of media anthropology, which focuses on the intersections of culture and media consumption, production, and materiality. The class explores the history of media and cultural studies, and how they have informed con-temporary media anthropological approaches. The class combines the discussion of theoretical and ethical issues, film and video screenings, and practical assignments in visual ethnography, using a variety of avail-able media. Prerequisite: , 102 or 295 strongly recommended. Offered occasionally.352  Critical Studies of Organizations, Work, and Management  Changes in transportation, information, and communication technology, as well as artificial intelligence and automation are rapidly transforming occupational and commercial arrangements. These forces of transnational economic integration undermine conventional organizational and com-mercial forms, and in so doing alter the ways people execute work and management in many fields. This course examines these phenomena by focusing on work and management in different phases of product and ser-vice supply chains locally and globally, in addition to examining differences in experience of these processes on the basis of race, class, gender, na-tivity, and other intersecting social dimensions. Offered occasionally.  360  Sociology of Health and Medicine   This course examines the so-ciological dimensions of health, illness and the profession of medicine. Specifically, this course will address five primary themes: 1) The social construction of health and disease and medical knowledge; 2) health and illness behavior: the study of behaviors related to staying healthy and to interpreting and responding to symptoms of illness; 3) Social Epidemiology: the study of patterns of distribution of disease and mor-tality in the United States; 4) the organization of the United States health care system compared to systems found in the other countries; and 5)the socialization and organization of health care professionals.365  Global Health  This course serves as an introduction to issues sur-rounding global health. Students explore multiple mechanisms that lead to health inequalities around the world, along with policies and interven-tions that aim to deal with issues of morbidity and mortality at a national and/or global scale. Topics covered in this course include, but are not lim-ited to: the impact of globalization on the health of specific populations, socioeconomic contexts of disease, issues of infectious disease and nu-trition, the interplay between culture and health, ethical and human rights concerns, and the role of NGOs and non-profits in global health.370  Disability, Identity, and Power  Disability studies offers perhaps the most trenchant critique of “the hegemony of the normal”—that is, the reification and privileging of certain numerical indices (for example, IQ score; body mass index; weight and height; complete blood count; range of motion; brainwave frequencies; and other such measurements which are then regarded as “better” or “worse” than comparable num-bers). While certainly accepting the importance of such measurements in designing treatments and strategies to improve the quality of life for people living in pain, disability studies seeks to balance this “experi-ence-distant” emphasis on “the quantified life” with “experience-near” insights. Thus disability studies seeks out, reflects on, and tries to incor-porate and prioritize the meta-biological realities of the lived experiences of people with disabilities (defined here as lifelong or chronic biological and/or psychological impairments), especially in policy-making endeavors inspired by ideals of social justice. Hence this course focuses on issues of power, disparity, and diversity of experience and identities, particularly as these affect and are affected by the minds and bodies of individuals who “have” (or are socially close to people who “have”) conditions that mark them as “not normal”. Unlike studies done from the perspective of the healing professions, where non-normalcy is regarded as a condition to be helped or remedied, this course, following the perspective of dis-ability studies, is less concerned with identifying and “fixing” deviation from some statistically defined ideal range, and more directly focused on socially grounded, ever-dynamic identity construction and its relation to emancipatory social change, especially when these processes involve confrontations between individuals with disabilities and the various social institutions (e.g. education, health care, legal and economic systems) they (or their caregivers) must deal with throughout their lives. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.380 Muslim Cultures and Communities  Islam has significant influ-ence on a broad array of nations, ethnic groups, and local expressions of culture, and plays a role in shaping societies’ politics, economics, and law. Taking a practice-focused, anthropological perspective on the study of religion, this course examines the many ways in which culture and society have been co-influenced by Islam in different parts of the world, including here in the Pacific Northwest. The objective of this course is to move beyond stereotypes and essentialization to better understand the diverse, lived experience of Muslims around the world, and the ways that collab-orative, ethnographic social science can help in understanding Islam as a way of life. The course aims to help students develop a critical awareness of the ways Muslims’ understandings of their faith can be mediated by social, economic, and political phenomena. Students further explore representational politics and power relations surrounding Islam, and how Western powers have historically represented the Islamic world and Muslims, both at home and abroad.390  Men and Masculinities   This course offers a critical analysis of what it means to be a man using a sociological lens. Feminist scholars made gender visible, problematizing both femininities and masculinities in order to challenge and transform unequal gender relations. Yet until recent decades, men were rather invisible as men, as gendered beings, in academic research. Building on the insights of gender studies, the course emphasizes the socially constructed, power-laden, and historical-ly and culturally variable character of masculinities in its multiple forms. Readings highlight the individual, interactional, and institutional process-es through which men become men and “do masculinity” in relation to both women and other men. Using an intersectional approach, the course also explores how masculinities are shaped by other axes of dif-ference and inequality, including class, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and age.  Masculinities are analyzed across multiple contexts over the life course, including intimate relationships, schools, families, work-places, and organizations. Diverse forms of masculinities in the United States as well as masculinities in Mexico, Russia, and Western Europe will be considered.Sociology and AnthropologyUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     197407  Political Ecology   Political ecology is an active interdisciplinary framework with foundations in anthropology, geography, environmental studies and the biological sciences.  Its central contention is that our understanding of environmental issues and environmental change must include an analysis of the social, political, economic, and cultural context in which they are produced.  Through a set of advanced readings in the social sciences, students become familiar with the genealogy of this interdisciplinary approach, the keystone texts that inform contemporary political/ecological work, and the new directions that comprise the cut-ting edge of political ecology.  Recurring themes in the reading list will examine indigenous peoples struggle over resources, the construction of nature through the capitalist lens, and an examination of sustainability in both discourse and practice. Students conduct original ethnographic research that builds upon these areas of interest. Advanced coursework in anthropology, sociology, and/or international political economy is strongly recommended. Crosslisted with , 102, 295 or 296, 298, 299, 301.

The SIM may be in a recognized interdis-ciplinary field or in an emergent field. The course of study is designed by the student in concert with a multi-disciplinary faculty committee. The plan of study must present a coherent program in the liberal arts and include strong methodological grounding in the relevant disciplines. The plan of study must also include upper-division coursework sufficient for the student to develop knowledge and analytic tools sophisticated enough to permit interdisciplinary synthesis. The student must demon-strate this knowledge and analytical skill by preparing and publicly pre-senting a senior thesis or project. Sociology and Anthropology/Spanish/Special Interdisciplinary Major198     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Special Interdisciplinary Major/Student Affairs CoursesThe purpose of a SIM is not to dilute an existing major, but to allow students to pursue areas of study that cannot adequately be addressed through existing majors, minors, and programs. For some students the pursuit of a SIM may be preferable to the completion of a double major.The SIM is supervised by a principal advisor from a relevant depart-ment with a committee of two or more other faculty members. At least one of the committee members must have their primary appointment in a different department or program from that of the principle advisor. All three committee members supervise implementation of the SIM, ap-prove changes when necessary, and certify completion of the approved course of study.Steps in the Development of a Special Interdisciplinary MajorStudents interested in pursuing the SIM must do the following:1. Create a SIM advisory committee composed of three faculty members from departments appropriate to the topic, including one as the principal faculty advisor. At least one of the committee members must have their primary appointment in a department or program different from that of the principal advisor.2. With the SIM advisory committee, develop a SIM application (ap-plication forms are available online, in the Registrar’s, Associate Deans’, and Academic Advising offices). 3. Submit the proposal to the Curriculum Committee no later than first term, junior year. Proposals submitted to the Curriculum Committee by October 1 or February 15 will be acted upon before registration for the following term. 4. Complete the program plan approved by the Curriculum Committee. Modifications to the approved SIM program require approval by the SIM Advisory Committee and the Curriculum Committee. The Registrar will be notified of any modifications to the approved SIM program.PrerequisitesA student must have completed twelve units at Puget Sound before ap-plying for the SIM earning a cumulative GPA of at least 3.2. The student must also have completed at least four units of coursework relevant to the SIM before submitting a proposal.Requirements for the Special Interdisciplinary Major 1. A minimum of 12 courses, of which 10 must be at the 200 level or above and of which 6 must be at the 300 level or above. The major may not exceed 16 units. Nine of the 12 required courses must be completed at the Tacoma campus. 2. No more than 2 Independent Study units may be applied to the SIM. If 2 Independent Studies are proposed, one must focus on the integration of the fields within the SIM.3. A Senior Project () are also covered on the MCAT, and many students complete this coursework before taking the MCAT. Additionally, individual medical schools may require or recommend these and other courses, such as calculus and genetics, for admission. English courses are increasingly recommended by medical schools, and our seminars in Scholarly Inquiry generally fulfill such requirements. Students are encouraged to consult the Health Professions Advising website at pugetsound.edu/hpa and make early contact with the Health Professions Advising staff. The office, along with a resource center that includes entrance requirements, and other information, is located in Thompson Hall, Room 203.

Instead, “taking a broad range of difficult courses from demanding instructors is excellent preparation for legal education.” The LSAC and ABA recom-mend a curriculum that teaches “analytical and problem-solving skills, critical reading abilities, writing skills, oral communication and listening abilities, [and] general research skills.” Accordingly, Puget Sound offers no undergraduate pre-law major, encouraging students interested in the law to follow the academic program that most interests them and to seize every opportunity to take courses that will promote their critical thinking, reading, writing, and research skills.In their early years at Puget Sound, students interested in the law should concentrate on taking challenging courses in the disciplines that intrigue them. When they reach their junior year, they should begin ear-nestly, and specifically, researching both law schools and legal careers. Students should also begin to plan for the Law School Admission Test. Resource materials for pre-law students are available through the pre-law advisor Brad Reich (School of Business and Leadership, breich@pugetsound.edu).Career and Employment Services Career and Employment Services (CES) helps students acquire the skills, experiences, and contacts they will need to build a meaningful career after college.

AFAM 346," African Americans and American Law  African Americans and American Law   This course ex-plores the relationship between African Americans and American law, especially but not exclusively American constitutional law. The first part of the course examines important antebellum cases such as Scott v. Sanford (Dred Scott).The second part of the course traces two conflict-ing trajectories of legal decisions that emerged as the federal courts sought to determine whether and how the fourteenth amendment altered race relations in America. The final part of the course begins with the landmark Brown decision and then examines two important domains of American law: race, law, and American educational practices (e.g. desegregation, busing, affirmative action, school assignment poli-cies) and race, law, and the workplace (e.g. employment discrimination, affirmative action).

AFAM 360," The Art and Politics of the Civil Rights Era  The Art and Politics of the Civil Rights Era   This course employs an interdisciplinary approach to explore the history and expres-sive culture of the civil rights era. Emphasizing what historians call the “civil rights movement,” the course explores earlier strategies of resis-tance, the civil rights black power movements, and legacies of these movements. An interdisciplinary approach is particularly applicable for a course focused on the civil rights movements because the literature of racial protest and of the `black arts’ was not simply parallel to the politi-cal upheavals. As Amiri Baraka put it in 1971, “Art is Politics.” Readings and assignments engage the complex, sometimes contradictory, legal, political, literary, artistic, and musical responses to this charged histori-cal period.

AFAM 375," The Harlem Renaissance  The Harlem Renaissance   This course examines the re-naissance of African American literature, music, and visual art that, for the most part, emerges from Harlem, a cultural hub in the 1920s and 1930s. The course also approaches the literature, music, and visual art, as well as the social changes in Harlem, from different disciplinary per-spectives, including literary criticism, cultural history, music criticism, art criticism, and aesthetic theory. Students explore social and aesthetic de-bates that arose during the Harlem Renaissance and connect these two parallel debates today. Students also make connections between and among different artists and thinkers of the period, including Langston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois, Zora Neale Hurston, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Jean Toomer, Jessie Redmon Fauset, Wallace Thurman, Claude McKay, Sargent Johnson, Romare Bearden, Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, and Walter White. The course invites students to make connections between literature, visual art, and music from the period and between the Harlem Renaissance and their own ideas about art and society.

AFAM 401," Narratives of Race  Narratives of Race   This course takes as its central object the idea of race. Race is understood as a social construct that desig-nates relations of structural difference and disparity. How race is treated is a crucial issue in this course. It is in this question of “the how” that the term narrative becomes salient. The term narrative intentionally focuses attention on the material practices through which we have come to define race as a social construct. This terminology, “narratives of race” spotlights an interest in investigating the historical events and visual and verbal images employed in the linking, patterning, sequenc-ing, and relaying our ways of knowing race and its social relations. Implicated in the construction of race is its production and deployment of the moral and intellectual values that our academic disciplines bear. In considering such values as part of the investigation, this course includes careful comparative analyses of the ways in which the disciplinary systems of ontology, epistemology, aesthetics, and politics are used in the making and remaking of the academic and social grammars of race. Thus the analysis necessarily includes an intertextualization of the several academic disciplines engaging the question of race. Satisfies the Connections core requirement. and 402Requirements for the MinorA minor in African American Studies consists of 5 units:1. .Notes for the major and minora. Students may apply up to two approved courses of study abroad credit toward their African American Studies major or minor. b. Majors and minors may satisfy no more than two university core requirement from African American Studies offerings.c. When a course both supports their African American Studies major and fulfills a major or minor requirement in another field, a student may count no more than two units from that major or minor toward their African American Studies major.d. Students majoring or minoring in African American Studies must earn a grade of C- or higher in all courses which are taken in fulfill-ment of a major or minor requirement.e. The African American Studies program reserves the option of de-termining, on an individual basis, a time limit on the applicability of courses to the major or minor.Depth ElectivesDepth courses provide students with specialized knowledge in African American experiences, opportunities for sustained and deep thinking about a topic in African American Studies, and specifically highlight how African American Studies acquires, organizes, and defines knowl-edge. Students will acquire new methodological or theoretical tools to understand and situate African American experiences and their import. A course will meet the depth criteria if: (1) course topics are central to African American experiences; (2) these topics are considered across the course; and  (3) the course introduces methodological or theoretical tools rooted in African American Studies.  Courses that currently count toward the depth elective are: Narratives of Race101  Introduction to African American Studies    This course provides an examination of intellectual and creative productions, developments, and events that have come to be recognized as forming the discipline of African American Studies.

Prerequisite: .ART AND ART HISTORYProfessor: Zaixin Hong; Michael Johnson; Kriszta Kotsis; Janet Marcavage; Elise Richman, Chair; Linda WilliamsAssistant Professor: Chad GundersonAbout the DepartmentThe Department of Art and Art History offers two Bachelor of Arts degrees:  Studio Art and Art History. The two majors are distinct, but students in each area are required to take supporting courses in the UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     41Art and Art Historyother to ensure breadth and depth in their knowledge of art. The spe-cific education of artists and of art historians, which includes technical skills, visual analysis, and research methodologies, are taught within the context of our liberal arts institution. The department values providing a strong liberal arts education and writing and critical thinking skills are emphasized in all art courses. Department of Art and Art History cours-es serve majors as well as students who are enrolled in the Artistic Approaches core. Careful attention is given to meet the needs of stu-dents from diverse majors and programs. The Department of Art and Art History occupies three buildings with Kittredge Hall and its gallery as the nucleus. Studio art courses are also taught in the Ceramics Building and the Sculpture House. Approximately eight exhibitions are held each academic year in the Kittredge Gallery, including a juried student show and the senior studio art thesis show in the spring semester.Students who graduate from the Department of Art and Art History will be able to:1. Clearly articulate ideas in visual, verbal, and written form that re-flect critical thinking and sustained engagement with the field.2. Successfully critique and discuss aesthetic experiences and apply training in visual literacy.3. Apply theories and methods of artistic creation and critical evalua-tion of sources with an understanding of social and historical con-text.4. Demonstrate the ability to independently create works in the plas-tic arts and/or complete significant research projects in the history of art.5. Through the study and creation of art, develop a nuanced under-standing of self and a more sophisticated view of our world in order to participate as successful and mindful citizens. Studio Art Studio art students master distinct processes, an understanding of the principles of design, a familiarity with art history, and sensitivity to ex-pression in visual languages, and strategies for developing strong visual communication skills. They also form the ability to synthesize formal and conceptual issues and develop an understanding of how visual art re-lates to contemporary culture. The studio areas are well equipped for an institution of our size. Areas of concentration include ceramics, painting, printmaking, and sculpture. In addition to instruction from the regular staff, a number of visiting artists are brought to the campus each year to lecture and work with students. Studio classes average 15 students per class, providing opportunities for close relationships between faculty and students. The studio faculty are all are exhibiting artists, showing their works in national and international exhibitions as well as in regional and local shows. Art HistoryArt history majors develop an understanding of the trajectory of multiple art historical periods and cultivate skills in analyzing artworks from a wide range of cultures and from various methodological approaches. Students are also introduced to the historiography of the discipline and fundamental methods of analyzing art. Written work culminates in the presentation of a capstone paper that demonstrates the student’s ability to apply methods of research and analysis. Courses in art history cover the surveys of Western and Asian art, with upper division (300-400 level) studies in Ancient, Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque, 19th and 20th Century European and American art, Mexican, Chinese, and Japanese art, and Asian calligraphy. Sophomore level standing or con-sent of instructor is required for 300 level courses.

ASIA 335," Chinese Painting and Poetry Chinese Painting and Poetry   Combining some of the great-est works of Chinese poetry with approaches and visual materials from the history of Chinese landscape painting, in this course students ex-amine the changing use of landscape as a medium to express different philosophical and social meanings by competing social groups across historical periods from early times to the 13th century.  In the first half of this course, students see how natural landscape in poetry became a medium for conveying a range of different ideals and problems: official service and reclusion in the countryside, Daoist liberation and Buddhist enlightenment, the sorrows of war on the frontier or travel into exile.  In the second half of this course, they apply their knowledge of Chinese poetry to interpreting a series of paintings from the Song dynasty (960-1279). This period is the golden age of Chinese landscape paint-ing. It saw the emergence of literati-painters who, much like the great painters of the Renaissance, argued that painting possessed the same expressive power as poetry.  Students explore the ways they employed painting to comment on an unprecedented range of issues, including government affairs, the role of women in society, the relation of private to public life, as well as the experience of dynastic collapse and war.

ASIA 341," Asia Pop! An Exploration of Popular Culture in 20th and     21st Century East Asia  Asia Pop! An Exploration of the Popular Culture of 20th and 21st Century East Asia  For the first half of the twentieth century, China and Japan were most often viewed as sites of imperialism and war. During the second half of the twentieth century, discussions of Japan focused on its economic boom while discussion of China focused on the entrenchment of the Chinese Community Party. While this course gives attention to major political and economic developments in East Asia during the past century, the focus is on East Asia as a site of cultural production. Among the sources are critical essays in the 1910s meant to spur China towards literary and cultural revolution, anime that explores post-apocalyptic visions of Japan, and Mandopop songs that contemplate what it means to be young and modern in China today. All of these sources examine interactions within East Asia and between East and West in the development and dissemination of popular culture during the past century.; ;  Asia Pop!

ASIA 344," Asia in Motion  Asia in Motion   This course explores the interactions of Asian peoples—the commodities, social practices, and ideas which they produce—across borders, both political and imagined. The course crosses disciplinary borders, as well, drawing upon divergent materials from the humanities and social sciences in an attempt to do justice to a contemporary context that could be called “Asia in motion.” An under-lying thesis holds that, since nineteenth-century colonialism, nations in the “West” and “Asia” participate in a global, dialectical movement in which notions of identity (national, cultural, ethnic, religious, territorial, linguistic) share moments of fluidity and fixity.

CONN 304," The Invention of Britishness: History and Literature  The Invention of Britishness: History and Literature   This course addresses the question what it means to be British through his-torical and literary texts. Beginning with the premise that Britishness is not innate, static or in any way permanent, but “invented” and constant-ly constructed and deconstructed, this course traces the development of British national identity from its origins in the eighteenth century to the present. Students read both historical and literary works that eluci-date the changing meaning of “Britishness” as the state expanded and collided with its counterparts on the British Isles and its imperial hold-ings in other countries.

Moonshine from Tennessee, mescal from Oaxaca, palinka from Hungary, airag from Mongolia, feni from India, cachaça from Brazil, sopi from Indonesia, the list goes on and on. While fermentation and distillation are nearly universal in human society, every flavor of hooch has its own botanical, chemical, cultural, economic, and political story to tell. This class takes a cross-disciplinary approach to the study of hooch, from yeast and plant to bottle to society. Students read scientific, his-torical, anthropological, and political economic texts, watch films, listen Connections26     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  to music, and participate in experiential learning modules designed to teach the art and science of liquor production.

CONN 309," Applied Environmental Politics and Agenda Setting  Applied Environmental Politics and Agenda Setting   This is a political science course. It is more ambitious than a survey of environmental problems in the U.S., because problems do not speak for themselves. While environmental problems reflect certain empirical realities about our physical world, they come to our attention through human contests over values. Environmental problems are strategically defined, managed, promoted, and challenged by a complex array of social actors. In a word, environmental problems are “political.” This course explores the politics underlying the societal decisions we make regarding the environment. The essential question for this course is: Why do some environmental problems rise on governmental agendas while other problems are neglected? Course objectives include 1) de-veloping enduring understanding of the politics affecting our societal environmental decisions; 2) cultivating analytical and research skills that reveal the values, incentives, and strategies of political actors affecting environmental policy; and 3) gaining familiarity with a range of national and regional environmental problems.

CONN 318," Crime and Punishment  Crime and Punishment   The U.S. criminal justice system has embraced retribution at the expense of other models of justice. Retributive punishment harms and sometimes kills; therefore it is either wrong or needs justification. This course suggests that such justifica-tion is difficult to construct and is undermined by pervasive injustices of classism and racism. Is restorative justice a viable alternative? The course begins by studying the death penalty in the Abrahamic traditions and understanding how contemporary Jews, Muslims, and Christians argue against capital punishment. Attention turns to philosophical ar-guments for and against retributive justice and capital punishment. The course then explores how well philosophical justifications of retributive punishment withstand the sociological injustices that some argue are embedded in the criminal justice system. The psychology of danger-ous, violent offenders is studied to understand how their backgrounds may or may not mitigate imposition of a death sentence. In the final unit, the viability of restorative justice is investigated. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.: Crime and Punishment (Connections Core)  Crime and PunishmentArea D.

By apply-ing concepts and critical thinking processes developed in this course to personal lifestyle and political decisions, students are prepared to make more informed choices on emerging personal and policy issues related to health. The course emphasizes holistic approaches to understanding and preventing disease. Both allopathic and alternative interventions are explored. Major topics include defining health; therapeutic options including allopathic, complementary (e.g., homeopathy, Chinese med-icine, etc.), and more experimental approaches (e.g., gene therapy); the central, somatic, and autonomic nervous systems; psychobiology; stress and stress management methods; approaches to prevention and treatment of conditions such as cancer and AIDS; issues in public policy and financing of mainstream and alternative healing approaches; ethical dilemmas such as informed consent, confidentiality, compliance, health care directives, allocation of resources, euthanasia, dying, grieving, and hospice.

CONN 322," Jihad and Islamic Fundamentalism  Jihad and Islamic Fundamentalism   The emergence of Islamic fundamentalism and Islamist political thought in the twentieth century has garnered much media attention in the last few decades. This course examines how Islamic fundamentalism developed in the first half of the twentieth century in the wake of Western colonization and why it gained so much support during the second half of the cen-tury. The course develops in three stages: (1) historical background of Muslim confrontations with the West and the emergence of fundamen-talism, (2) case studies of selected Muslim countries and regions, and finally (3) discussion of challenges and problems of fundamentalism in a pluralistic world. Similarly, the course examines the major intellectu-al figures of Islamist thought and its malcontents in the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, and the Muslim communities of Europe and the Americas. Examples include: Hassan al-Banna, Abu Ala Mawdudi, Sayyid Qutb, Ayatollah Khomeini, Usama bin Ladin, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Khaled Abou El Fadl, Sherman Jackson, among others. Islamist ideas of modernity and the revival of a traditionalist approach towards the life and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad is also discussed.

CONN 325," The Experience of Prejudice   The Experience of Prejudice   This course uses the disci-plinary lenses of psychology and literary studies to examine how the world looks and feels from the perspective of someone who is a mem-ber of an oppressed or negatively stereotyped group. The course pro-vides an introduction to the assumptions, scientific methods, and forms of writing used by experimental social psychologists and to theories and research findings bearing on the experience of prejudice. Analysis of literary texts including poetry, fiction, and autobiography provide additional insights into the experience of prejudice. Integration and syn-thesis occurs by comparing and contrasting the two approaches, using psychology as a lens for analyzing literature, using literature as a source of ideas to inform psychology, and considering how insights gained from both approaches might be used together to create positive personal or social change.

CONN 330,"  Finding Germany: Memory, History, and Identity in     Berlin    Finding Germany: Memory, History, and Identity in Berlin   Germans are still asking themselves the question: “What does it mean to be German?” Throughout its recent history, Germany has re-peatedly turned to Berlin, its re-designated (and re-designed) capital, in an attempt to find its own identity. In this way, Berlin could be seen as a mirror of German affairs. Emphasizing the textual and visual histories of the city, this interdisciplinary course explores the effects of transition and upheaval on Berlin, highlighting the interconnectivity of history and memory discourses, topography, popular culture, the arts, politics, urban renewal, and multiculturalism. Discussions focus on Berlin’s ever-changing façade and constant self-reinvention and re-evaluation.  Definitions of “metropolis” and close readings of the city as “textual space” will be covered within the framework of questions of modernity and post-modernity.

Primary focus is on highly interre-lated nation-building projects in five parts of Europe: France, Germany, Hapsburg Austria, Poland, and Russia. Seminar discussions draw on major theoretical works on nationalism as well as primary source texts like speeches, literary works, memoirs and diaries written by Europeans who embraced or struggled with national identity.

CONN 334," Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa and Beyond  Truth and Reconciliation in South Africa and Beyond   This course uses South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (established in 1995) as a starting point for considering questions around historical trauma, transitional justice and the production of knowledge. Students analyze the TRC in terms of South African history and identity, examining ways in which it both replicated and sought to remake relationships of power within that country, and also explore points of comparison with TRCs in other countries. As a Connections core course, the course introduces students to a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Students consider the TRC as a self-conscious (re)writing of history, as a political strategy for nation-building, as a psychological treatment for trauma, as the creation of a body of narratives, and as a religious/spiritual exercise. As a KNOW course, the course requires stu-dents to think about how issues of identity and positionality impacted the engagement of various South Africans with the TRC and to reflect on how their own positionality shapes their understanding of truth and reconciliation, both in South Africa and elsewhere, including the United States.

Race and Multiculturalism in the American Context   The objective of this course is to cultivate an appreciation of the intersection of a sociological and historical approach to understanding the complex-ity and dynamics of race relations and multiculturalism in the American context. Using scholarly resources from these two distinct disciplinary traditions, the course provides students with a comparative and critical appreciation of the development of race relations in the United States. In examining the concrete historical developments and sociological patterns in race/ethnic relations, the course enables student to develop a more nuanced and comprehensive appreciation of a multidisciplinary approach to the study of race relations and multiculturalism. Through such an integrated approach, students better recognize and understand Connections28     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  terns of neural organization), genetic sex (i.e. chromosomal sex), and phenotypic sex (i.e. how ones body develops and presents) can be dis-associated from one another. That disassociation speaks to a biological reality that is not adequately (or often accurately) codified by the dom-inant social construct of gender. This course examines the intricacies and nuances of sexual differentiation with the goal of understanding this process from a multi-level view from which solid inferences can be made as to the biological underpinnings of certain aspects of gender and sexual identity formation variability.

CONN 340," Gender and Communication  Gender and Communication   Using gender as the primary focus, this course engages students in critical analysis of the ways in which symbol systems in their cultural contexts function to create sub-jective spaces (e.g. assign specific roles) for particular groups of people. Students learn how communication practices shape the ways gender is viewed, how these practices constrain or promote resistance, and how individuals and groups negotiate their subjective spaces and “gen-derized” practices. Students study the role of imagery and language in constructing gendered identities, the social construction of culturally defined categories such as masculinity and femininity, the gendered body, and contemporary trends of theories on gender to examine gen-der across race, class, nation, and empire. Additionally, students make connections between their everyday lives, their specific disciplinary backgrounds, and the course materials. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

CONN 344," Magic and Religion  Magic and Religion   This course in intellectual history draws upon history, religion, anthropology, and sociology in order to un-derstand how the categories of ‘religion’ and ‘magic’ have been shaped by the Western, and largely Christian-influenced, tradition. ‘Magic’ and ‘religion’ arose out of the history of the West’s engagement with inter-nal groups decried as ‘deviant,’ such as medieval ‘heretics,’ or Catholics in the Protestant imagination, and then, during colonialism, in response to other societies and cultures. The course draws upon a range of dis-ciplines to examine how intellectual categories are dynamic, how they shaped over time, and how particular assumptions and viewpoints in-form the creation of these categories. Offered occasionally. Satisfies the Connections Core requirement.

CONN 345," Economics of Happiness  Economics of Happiness   This course explores the intersection of economics and happiness.  It critiques several of the key assumptions in mainstream economic theory, in particular those involving how the production and acquisition of greater material goods affect well-being. The course taps the research in the burgeoning field of the economics of happiness, much of which counters traditional economic ideas. The course also draws on recent related findings in positive psychology and to a lesser degree in neuroscience, spe-cifically the findings in neuroscience that relate to mindfulness and meditation. In addition, the course utilizes several metrics (such as the Genuine Progress Indicator and the Happy Planet Index) to assess the happiness and well-being of different countries; these measures are juxtaposed with the standard measure of economic well-being: Gross Domestic Product (GDP). One of the alternative measures to GDP, Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness, serves as a vehicle to fur-ther consider the implications of Buddhist wisdom for economics.  While examining these alternative measures, students consider the implications for social policy regarding issues such as consumerism, inequality, ecological sustainability and work-family balance.

CONN 358," The Mississippi River  The Mississippi River  Named with an Ojibwa word mean-ing “Great River,” the Mississippi River is 2,320 miles long and its drainage basin covers 31 states and roughly 40 percent of the United States land mass.  This course considers the river as an historical and imaginative site, a place where a diversity of people have lived, worked, loved, fought, and died, and also as a place that has played a role in the imaginations of those peoples. Investigations focus especially on the river as it shaped the United States and as Americans have constructed it, imagined it, and used it to tell stories about themselves and their nation.  Students have the opportunity to explore contemporary issues facing the river and those whose lives are intimately connected to it. As a course meeting the requirements for the Connections core, the course takes seriously its employment of multiple disciplinary methods, and student have the opportunity to integrate their studies in scholarly and primary sources drawn especially from history, literature, film studies, environmental studies and African American Studies.

CONN 359," The United States in the 1960s  The United States in the 1960s   This course explores the history of the United States during the “long 1960s.” Focusing espe-cially on topics and themes in political, social, and cultural history, the course emphasizes the movements for change that challenged existing norms in arenas as varied as race relations, sexuality, gender, and for-eign affairs, and engages the intersection of politics and art in these contests. Employing methods and sources from a range of disciplines, key themes in the course include the construction of cultural concepts of liberalism and conservatism, of gradualism and radicalism; the com-plications of alliance across racial, class and gender lines; Americans’ often conflicting views of themselves, of the responsibilities of citizen-ship, and of their role in the world; the complex role of the media in shaping those understandings; the complicated relationship between activism and the counterculture on the one hand, and between events at home and abroad on the other; the exposure of secrecy and abuse of power in the government and a corresponding growth of distrust among the citizenry; and generational conflict.

By examining the roles of goddesses within the realm of political and religious powers from cross-cultural perspectives in diverse historical periods, students under-stand how a culture values religious and political powers; its attitudes towards power and sovereignty; and how issues of power, gender, and divinity are inter-related. These comparisons of power help students re-flect on their own constructions of religious and political power and their attitudes towards them. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

CONN 372," The Gilded Age: Literary Realism and Historical Reality  The Gilded Age: Literary Realism and Historical Reality   This course considers the connections between U.S. literature and his-tory in the late-nineteenth-century and beyond, as we study the impact of the Gilded Age (1873 – 1889) on past and present American society. It was an era of growth and industry surpassing any other before it in the history of the U.S. and, some claimed, the world. It was also a time in which a gilded exterior hid a baser, even defective social core, when appearance sought to conceal but could not eradicate an ugly reality. Reading three novels of the time, William Dean Howells’s The Rise of Silas Lapham, Mary Lane’s Mizora: A Prophecy, and Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court, students gain an understand-ing of the American realist tradition and consider how this literary genre both represented and reinvented what was “real” about the Gilded Age. In tandem, students analyze historical texts—works such as Andrew Carnegie’s Wealth and Jacob Riis’s How the Other Half Lives—and read contemporary perspectives, including those of historians Richard Hofstadter and Allen Trachtenberg. These texts, as well as two films, intertwine and converse with one another, inviting students to observe the interplay between two fields and methodologies that together shaped an influential and lasting myth of American might. Contributing to our understanding are cross-disciplinary conversations and projects that draw upon students’ own areas of interest and expertise. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

Students discover the relational nature of color and its role in evoking expressive content, communicating symbolically, and creating illusions of space and sensations of light. They discuss influential visual artists who have changed the way color is organized, opened up new perceptual possibilities, and experimented with new pigments and dyes. Students are initially exposed to the complex and beautiful steps (both chemically and physically) in the process of human vision, from initial light source to the signal in the brain. This fundamental background con-cerning the interactions of light and matter are continuously reflected upon as the history of color unfolds.

CONN 377," Caesar in Vietnam: PTSD in the Ancient World?  Caesar in Vietnam: PTSD in the Ancient World   This class takes a penetrating look at the burgeoning scholarly interest in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and its possible relevance to ancient combat in Greece and Rome. Extensive readings include selec-tions from Homer’s Iliad, Odyssey, the tragedies Aias and Herakles Mainomenos, and Roman battle accounts. Students then look at how various of these works have been interpreted as proof of PTSD in the ancient world, most notably by psychologist Jonathan Shay, but also by an increasing number of classical scholars. Modern studies of the causes of PTSD, its definition, and how it is diagnosed provide theories of how combat causes traumatic injury. Along the way students engage with firsthand accounts of combatants from multiple periods and battle zones. Each student then writes a research paper that explores a pre-in-dustrial account of combat using the theoretical models from modern psychological and social scientific writing as well as modern comparan-da.

CONN 387," Never-Never Land  Never-Never Land   Children are unique in American law as they are caught somewhere between adult and non-existent status. At least in theory the law is separate from individual moral beliefs or institutional ethical standards, but children blur such distinction. This course attempts to examine the evolution and future of children in the American legal system under legal, ethical, and moral perspectives, while likely recognizing that any pure compartmentalization is impos-sible. The course addresses issues such as when a “child” exists, what rights may exist before birth, the allocation of power between the state and parents, children’s rights within educational frameworks, child abuse and neglect, medical treatment decisions for children, child custody, juvenile delinquency, and limitation on minors’ liberties. While students focus on children, they find that these topics lead to broader issues such as social media and human trafficking.

Students explore scholarly frameworks used to understand contemporary migration and mobility, and the foundational scholarship that shapes our conceptualization of urban space and the urban landscape. Putting theories regarding state formation of immigration regimes into conversation with the lived expe-rience of migrants in the urban landscape provides a multi-dimensional vantage point on the patterns and consequences of migration. After students develop these theoretical foundations, they deploy these new perspectives in field excursions in the Puget Sound region, framed by a series of series of lecture/discussions and encounters with a number of experts, specialists, and practitioners concerned with Tacoma. Lectures, guest speakers, and field excursions focus on the city’s history of mi-gration, the legal framework governing contemporary admittance, the lived experience of foreigners’ place-making in the city, the interactions between migration flows and the built landscape of the city, and the cul-tural web through which the foreign presence is framed.

The relationship between work and public education is complex. It is one thing to argue for an education agenda that emphasizes “higher cognitive outcomes” for everyone based on current and future trends in the nature of work in the U.S., yet it may be too much to expect that even a highly successful education system alone can shape and sustain an economy. This course addresses how technology and globalization place new demands on work in advanced economies as well as how these new demands translate into dramatic proposals for changing the nature of public school education in the U.S. and selected Asian countries. A final theme in the course considers the issues of poverty and diversity by examining the children of highly mobile, generally low wage workers and the way they affect public education.

CONN 420," The American Progressive Ideal  The American Progressive Ideal   In 1872, Prussian-born and longtime Brooklyn resident John Gast painted “American Progress,” an artistic rendering of Americans’ dominant-cultural belief that they were destined to expand throughout the continent. In the painting, Columbia, an angelic female figure betokening Anglo-American “civilization,” drives benighted forces of “savagery” into oblivion and ushers in their replace-ments, those 19th-century emblems of progress, the telegraph wire, the locomotive, the farmer, the schoolbook. The technologies and the agrarian ideal may strike us today as quaint, but we may not question the nature or inevitability of American progress. Through the pairing of English Studies and Political Theory this Connections course identifies and in-terrogates an American narrative of progress beholden to the biological, political, economic, and sociological philosophies of mid-19th- to early 20th-century Europe. Within a capitalistic and “socially Darwinistic” sys-tem, what is progress? Who progresses and how? What does it mean to be “progressive”? The critical and creative engagement with such ques-tions about the mid-19th to early 20th-century U.S. equips students to examine inherited notions of American progress that are regularly invoked in American politics and culture today. From these various perspectives (primarily literary and philosophical, but also biological, historical, and so-ciological), students will develop an understanding of the development of an idea—progress—as an American political value. “Connections days” are discussion-oriented classes specifically devoted to cross-disciplinary dialogue so that students and faculty alike can interrogate these myriad perspectives. Finally, student writing assignments are devised to help students learn to work with textual materials and to situate and prob-lematize this narrative in contemporary American discourse.

This course provides students with the tools to understand these and other questions about how politics works around the globe. The study of comparative politics focuses on the basic foundations of political life and how these insti-tutions differ in form and power around the world. This introductory course deals with such central concepts as nation and state, citizenship and ethnicity, political ideology, religious fundamentalism, revolution, terrorism and political violence, the relationship between politics and markets, democracy and authoritarianism, electoral systems and differ-ent forms of representation, development and globalization. These con-cepts are investigated through a number of country case studies, which may include the United Kingdom, Japan, Russia, China, Iran, India and South Africa, among others.

What role can non-states actors play in international politics? These are just some of the questions considered in this course. By focusing on the interaction of contemporary and historical international actors—including states, inter-governmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations—this course examines the interplay of political, economic, social, and cultural factors that influence the international distribution of power and wealth and contribute to world conflict and cooperation. Specific areas of study include causes of interstate war, terrorism, economic globalization, and international law and organizations. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement.

Students explore the connections between normative and empirical claims, uses of evidence, and theory building and testing. They ask how theoretical ideas are generated and how they inform the world around them (both explicitly and implicitly). In the second half of the course, they focus on the concept of power, cen-tral to any study of politics, to ask: how do actors use claims, theories, and data to reinforce or subvert dominant power structures? This class provides students the tools and perspective to become more thought-ful interlocutors and more critical consumers of information by helping them better understand the process(es) of knowledge construction. This is a required course for the major. Prerequisite: declared PG majors only; any two 100-level PG courses. This course should be taken before the junior year. 300  Methods, Analysis, and Argument in Political Literature  This course examines approaches and methods that will most improve ma-jors’ reading, writing, and discussing books, articles, and other media related to politics and government.  The instructor and students will coach each other in efficient but perceptive reading, skeptical but sym-pathetic consideration of and conversation about perceptions and inter-pretations, and sensible planning and careful executing of responses to extant researches.  304  Race and American Politics   Race is central to understanding U.S. politics. This course asks the questions: what does race mean; how has it changed over time; what is the relationship between race and ethnic-ity and power; and what is the role of race in U.S. politics. This course examines these questions by looking at a variety of historical and con-temporary moments, and a variety of political forces including electoral politics, social movements, government institutions, and everyday poli-tics. By the end of this course, students should be able to talk critically about the evolution of the concept of race in America, identify how race shapes our political language and outcomes, and evaluate contemporary racial politics. Prerequisite: "
CONN 478," Animals, Law, and Society  Animals, Law, and Society   Animals or their parts are ubiquitous—they are traded for food, companionship, clothing, research, entertainment, and sport. Animals are living beings that have the legal status of personal property. This dual status of both living being and per-sonal property creates a paradox of thought about how animals fit within western societies and cultures. Contemporary debates concerning the question of the animal tend to become entrenched around this bifurca-tion, with one side emphasizing the animal state of being, and the other, emphasizing their status as property. In this course students examine cultural and societal influences that affect the way that animals are understood within western society. Students explore the laws affect-ing and relating to animals, public policies that support the status quo versus social movements that challenge it, theoretical and philosophical perspectives relating to our conceptualization of animals (e.g. Foucault’s theory of power, Regan’s subject-of-a-life, speciesism, Francione’s abolition, feminist writings, etc.), creative non-fiction and fiction that addresses the question of the animal, and the ethics of the use of ani-mals. Students examine trends toward future change. Prerequisite: ju-nior or senior standing. Recommended: any law or legal studies course. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

CONN 480," Informed Seeing  Informed Seeing   Seeing (in contrast to mere “looking”) involves a learned propensity to notice (or ignore) particular aspects of what is perceived through the lenses of one’s culturally filtered perspec-tives. Whether these perspectives are “scientific” (involving deliberate doubt and systematic inquiry), “aesthetic” (involving the enjoyment of artfully crafted illusion), or “commonsensical” (involving enormously complicated but unquestioned assumptions about the nature of “real-ity”), the process of “seeing” (in this more-than-visual sense) can be constantly refined, yielding even more depth of experience. In relation to these ideas, this course explores some of the similarities and differenc-es in the way the world is seen through the perspectives of artists and art educators, cultural anthropologists, photographers, environmental-ists, science fiction writers, and filmmakers. These ways of “informed seeing” are applied to selected problems and philosophical questions involving “beauty,” “disruption of meaning,” and “choice.” While there are no prerequisites, students with some previous background in art, literature, anthropology, sociology, and/or environmental studies would be especially well prepared for this course. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.ConnectionsUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     31: Informed Seeing (Connections Core) can each be used as one of the 300-level or above electives.)Majors may satisfy no more than two university core requirements from Sociology and Anthropology offerings.

CONN 481," Gamblers, Liars, and Cheats  Gamblers, Liars, and Cheats   This course challenges students to recognize the ubiquity of probability and risk in their daily lives. The theme of stochasticity is explored through the perspectives of economists, psychologists, investors, entrepreneurs, political scien-tists, biologists, and of course mathematicians. Students are asked to explore critically the institutions, both formal and informal, which have developed to deal with risk and uncertainty in society. The concept of evidence in law and science is examined. Students also investigate the ways in which we perceive and respond to probability in the world around us. Prerequisite:   Gamblers, Liars, and Cheats Satisfies the Connections core requirement. "
ENVR 325," Geological and Environmental Catastrophes  Geological and Environmental Catastrophes   This course is a survey of natural and human-influenced geological “catastrophes,” and focuses primarily on four hazards that are relevant to the Puget Sound region: (1) volcanic eruptions, (2) earthquakes, (3) floods, (4) landslides. It examines the relationship of science and other fields, including economics and politics, in the development of policy to help us cope with potential catastrophes. The course reviews some of the scientific literature bearing on each disaster, discusses points of contro-versy with the scientific community, and considers ways in which our society—primarily government—uses this information to develop hazard mitigation strategies and regulations. Each unit concludes with analysis and discussion of one or more case studies. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

ENVR 335," Thinking About Biodiversity  Thinking About Biodiversity   The preservation of biodiver-sity—of the variety of living organisms here on Earth—has recently be-come a major focus of scientific and environmental concern and policy. This course draws on perspectives from history, ethics, environmental studies, and conservation biology to explore the ways in which ideas and values have shaped scientific approaches to biodiversity and to the current biodiversity crisis. Students who receive credit for  may not receive credit for  Thinking about Biodiversity Satisfies the Connections core requirement.  Thinking about Biodiversity  Thinking about Biodiversity105  Environmental Science   In this course, students examine the Earth as a system of integrated biogeochemical cycles (such as water, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur). Students come to understand these cy-cles by integrating relevant aspects of biology, geology, chemistry, and physics. Students learn how human activities can affect these natural biogeochemical cycles and inquire into potential system reaction to such impacts. This course also introduces students to the ways in which science is integrated into the interdisciplinary process of environmental studies. Satisfies the Natural Scientific Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally.200  Introduction to the Environment  This is the required introductory course for the Environmental Policy and Decision Making Minor , an inter-disciplinary program designed to help students integrate their major area of study with an understanding of how individual and collective decisions interact with the environment. The course uses approaches from the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to introduce the ways in which human social, political, economic, and cultural systems interact with systems in the non-human environment. The concept of “sustainability” is explored by considering the tension between the limiting principles in our world and competing human values over the question of what should be sustained for the future. This course includes a required overnight week-end trip early in the term. Offered Fall term only.201  Environmental Policy Tools and Topics   This course provides a foundation for upper-level policy electives in the Environmental Policy and Decision-Making Program by focusing on institutions and participa-tion in environmental policy. Students examine both domestic and inter-national arenas, with particular attention to the ways in which citizens engage with environmental issues in both familiar and unfamiliar places. Students in the course also learn tools and strategies for understanding environmental issues in diverse contexts, including discussion of differ-ent values and perspectives as well as changes in policies over time. Offered spring term only.202  Tools in Environmental Science  0.50 academic unit.  This course, using a tools-focused approach, provides a foundation in basic environmental sciences. The course emphasizes the following concepts: field skills, environmental sampling, data collection, data analysis, and development of scientific questions.  Students gain experience applying these concepts in lab and field-based settings. For example, experiential opportunities may include air quality monitoring, water sampling, eco-system characterization, biodiversity assessment, and spatial analysis. This course is intended for students not majoring in mathematics or the natural sciences. Offered spring term only. 203  Topics in Environmental Science  0.50 academic unit.  Writing and presenting science clearly means thinking clearly about science. This course addresses the two main challenges of science literacy: (1) the struggle to understand, and (2) the struggle to communicate that understanding.  This course provides students the opportunity to engage with the primary, scientific literature on a range of current interdisciplinary topics relevant to environmental science. Each topic is explored via case studies and review articles. In order to understand and discuss topics and readings, students apply environmental science methods and tools.210  Fundamentals of U.S. Environmental Law and Policy This course provides a basic introduction to environmental policymaking in the U.S. system of government, which includes the processes by which laws, rules and regulations, agency guidelines, court decisions, and internation-al agreements are established. The course explores several major areas of environmental concern. For each area, the class considers the human environmental impacts of concern, the political and policy history causing and addressing the concern, the way in which the current policies in this area work at various levels of government, and the way in which new legal interpretations and other forms of policy change might develop. Special attention is given to the way in which policy affects local and regional environmental issues here in the Pacific Northwest. Field trips and guest speakers are often incorporated into this class. Prerequisite: : Thinking about Biodiversity (Connections Core) Thinking about Biodiversity"
HON 401," What is America?  What is America?   This course aims to help students achieve a comprehensive and philosophical understanding of America through an interdisciplinary and critical examination of selected central themes. These themes may include: democracy, equality, and freedom; wealth and capitalism; nature and wilderness; religion and cult; slavery and the African-American experience; women’s experience and women’s rights; technology, experiment, and innovation; the West and manifest destiny; optimism, progress, and futurism; immigration and multiculturalism; individualism and pragmatism. Prerequisite: all other Honors core require-ments. This course satisfies the Honors Connections core requirement.  3. Three of the following four courses, usually taken during the sopho-more and junior years: "
HUM 300," Children’s Literature: To Teach and to Entertain  Children’s Literature: To Teach and to Entertain   This course focuses on rhymes, fables, and fairy tales—traditional litera-ture parents often still read to their young children, and much of which serves both to teach and to entertain (docet et delectat, the Latin dictum). Almost without fail, most collections of nursery rhymes, fa-bles, or fairy tales (indeed most children’s books) have usually been accompanied by illustrations of remarkable aesthetic power. The course commences with a study of the fable as literary form and the Aesopica, followed by a study of tales based on the oral tradition (and of more modern derivation) and the subsequent retelling or butchering of such tales by Disney. Finally, students explore the relationship between text and image in illustrated versions of Mother Goose rhymes from the se-miotic perspective—based on reading of works by the American philos-opher C.S. Peirce. Satisfies the Connections core requirement."
HUM 301," The Idea of the Self  The Idea of the Self   This course engages philosophical and literary works from the late seventeenth to the mid-twentieth century that document the emergence of the modern concept of the self. The authors considered explore such questions as, “Is the self static, deter-minate, and unified, or is it dynamic, ephemeral, and fragmented? Is it autonomous or culturally conditioned? Does it will its own actions, or are these determined by external circumstances? Is it innately good, or evil, or neither?” Working from literary, philosophical, historical, and psy-chological perspectives, the course traces how early modern thought in the West has variously represented the self, how these representations have reflected and influenced its cultural evolution, and how they remain embedded in contemporary formulations of selfhood. Authors include Pascal, Hobbes, Bunyan, Locke, La Rochefoucauld, De Lafayette, Franklin, Rousseau, Diderot, Hume, Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Dostoevsky, Freud, Kojeve, and Girard. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.  The Idea of the Self "
HUM 302," Mystics, Knights, and Pilgrims: The Medieval Quest   Mystics, Knights, and Pilgrims: The Medieval Quest   This course offers students an introduction to high medieval culture through verbal and visual experience of the quest. Medieval romances and spir-itual quest literature are informed by the neoplatonic idea of a transcen-dent reality, a divinely ordered world beyond us that yields an ultimate truth. At the same time, all such journeys begin in the post-Edenic world where the fallen senses can deceive the knight, the pilgrim, and the visionary navigating the dark forest, the garden of erotic pleasure, or the castle, where seemingly noble conduct masks sin. When the knight or pilgrim sets forth, he or she experiences not only the soul’s journey to God but also the construction of identity. Humanities 302 asks students to draw informed connections between the disciplines of history, art history, literary history, the history of gender, and the history of religion.

HUM 303," The Monstrous Middle Ages  The Monstrous Middle Ages   Why does monstrosity assume such a visible place in medieval culture? Gothic babwyns (gro-tesques) gambol in the margins of liturgical manuscripts, function as downspouts on cathedrals, and appear in epics and chivalric romances as forces of both good and evil. This course explores medieval ontology, the nature of creation, and our human ability to know it fully, through the monstrous. The course begins with an art historical introduction to Classical theories of monstrosity reflected in a visual tradition medieval artists and writers inherited. The role of the monstrous in pagan, clas-sical culture serve as a contrast to the place monsters assume in the evolving Christian contexts the course sets forth as interdisciplinary case studies in medieval monstrosity. Each case study sets up a histori-cal context for the study of monstrosity, informed by a specific material and literary culture. Recent research in art history, geography, anthropol-ogy, literary history, and cultural studies inform the course’s interdisci-plinary format. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

HUM 305," Modernization and Modernism The Core Curriculum10     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND    Modernization and Modernism   An exploration of late nineteenth and early twentieth century culture of Western Europe and the United States, organized around the concepts of modernization and modernism. The course focuses on the way in which modernist art op-poses those values inherent in social and political life at the turn of the twentieth century. Against the background of the elements of modern-ization, including democracy, education, transportation, communication, and technology, the course considers the work of artists and intellec-tuals such as Nietzsche, Marx, Kandinsky, Wagner, Freud, O’Neill, Lawrence, Joyce, Stravinsky, Kafka, Picasso, and Ives. The course also explores scholarly commentary on both the writers and artists and on the concepts developed to describe the intellectual and cultural histo-ry of the period. The course considers not only the values implicit in Connections32     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  the major texts themselves, but also the adequacy of concepts which scholars have developed to explain them.

HUM 309," Nationalism: British and German Nationalism in the Age     of Industrialization and Empire, 1700–1919   Nationalism: British and German Nationalism in the Age of Industrialization and Empire, 1700–1919   This course examines the development of British and German nationalism from the perspective of history and literary studies. The course also makes use of the visual arts, film, and song. Students in their papers and exams are asked to draw upon their knowledge of these interdisciplinary materials. By comparing and contrasting the forms that liberalism, conservatism, and socialism took in England and Germany, students become acquainted with a wide range of political and sociopolitical visions of freedom and authority that still inform national conflicts today. Satisfies the Connections core requirement. "
HUM 310," Imperialism and Culture: the British Experience   Imperialism and Culture: the British Experience   An explo-ration of the break-up of the British colonial empire of the 18th and 19th century as reflected in literature and history. Emphasis is placed upon the idea of imperialism, the role of culture in imperial expansion, the concep-tion of national character, and the process of decolonization. The readings trace the theory of empire in the metro pole and its practice in the colony in both literary and historical works. The course is organized around the interaction of two disciplines: history and literature, emphasizing the ways in which two discourses treat the past. History not only provides an account of the past and therefore a context for literary works, but also incorporates aspects of literary language and method; conversely, literary texts that focus on the past attempt to capture a reality of historical ex-perience. By reading selections from each discipline students are able to gauge how two distinct but related disciplines reflect upon the culture of a particular epoch. Particular attention is given to the British experience in India. Satisfies the Connections core requirement. "
HUM 315," Drama, Film, and the Musical Stage  Drama, Film, and the Musical Stage   This interdisciplin-ary humanities course (theater, music, film) explores the artistic and cultural meanings of selected dramatic works and their treatment in film from Sophocles to Shaw and the ways librettists, composers, and directors have adapted plays to the musical stage and film from Mozart to Bernstein. The course examines not only what has been adapted, discarded, and transformed in musical stage and film versions of dra-matic works, but also why particular changes in structure, emphasis, and interpretation were thought necessary and desirable. Students also explore the evolving cultural and aesthetic values from one era to anoth-er as they discover what musical stage and film adaptations of plays can reveal about the present as well as the past.

Offered every other year.181  Introduction to Online Communication   This course provides an introduction to the field of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as it exists within the discipline of Communication. The course covers a broad range of CMC theories and applies them to modern use of existing technologies (e.g., email, mobile telephony) and newer media (social media and Web 2.0 systems such as Facebook, Twitter, and online dating) in an effort to uncover how these technological systems affect today’s communication climate. Specific areas may include the following: online impression formation, online self-presentation, person-al relationships, political campaigns, habitual media use, e-commerce, brand management, and online advertising. Students will be introduced to social science research, scholarly argument, and empirical observa-tion. Prerequisite: first-year or sophomore only, or instructor permission. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently. 230  Communication Theory   This course is designed to introduce stu-dents to the role that theory plays in different types of communication research. The course looks at the different motives scholars have for studying communication and the different types of theory they develop to pursue these motives. In addition, the main areas of communication scholarship are reviewed with respect to the theories that can inform research in those domains. The class is divided into six general, topical foci: Individual/sender processes, receiver-based processes (message processing), relational processes (dyads and social networks), media, gender/culture/society, and organizations/groups. Students are expected to engage in practices of close reading, critique, and evaluation of these theories within the communication tradition.

HUM 330," Tao and Landscape Art  Tao and Landscape Art   Taoism is one of the most influen-tial beliefs in East Asia, and is perfectly embodied in landscape art. As a significant visual tradition in the world, this landscape art reveals the complicated relationships between man and self, man and man, man and society, and, above all, man and nature. From an interdisciplinary perspective the course examines the richness of this cultural heritage. The achievements of Taoist landscape art in China, Korea, and Japan are approached through slide lectures, museum visits, creative work sessions, writing assignments, group discussion, and class presentation of research projects. The emphasis is placed on students’ comprehen-sion of Taoism and appreciation of landscape art and their capacity to explore the intricate relationships between art and religion.

HUM 335," Japan and the Dutch: A Cross-Cultural Visual Dialogue     1600-2000  Japan and the Dutch: A Cross-Cultural Visual Dialogue 1600-2000   Geographically, Japan and The Netherlands (often referred to as Holland) are relatively small countries, never far from the ocean, with large, highly urbanized and literate populations engaged in dynamic civic rivalries. Historically, the relationship between the two has been close. For a long period, the Dutch of “Holland,” a major maritime and trading power in the 17th century, provided the Japanese with their window on the world. It was in fact a two-way window, a way, through Dutch merchants, Japan learned of Europe, but also Holland and the rest of Europe (and America) learned of Japan. From a cross-cultural perspec-tive the course examines the richness of the 300/400 years Japan-Dutch artistic relations in a variety of media. The achievements in the visual arts in these countries are approached through illustrated lectures, museum visits, creative work sessions, writing assignments, group discussions, and class presentations of individual research projects.

HUM 368," A Precious Barbarism: Enlightenment, Ideology, and     Colonialism  A Precious Barbarism: Enlightenment, Ideology, and Colonialism   This course presents a constellation of influential critiques of Western intellectual history, especially examining Enlightenment liberalism and its ideological afterlives. Themes include: critique, Euro-American centrism, orientalism, de-colonial struggles, postcolonial theory, pathologies of freedom, power, hegemony, racialization, identi-ty, liberalism, the democratic illusion, mass deception, the Holocaust, camps, mass migration, terrorism, comprador intellectuals, and culture war. Horkheimer and Adorno’s Dialectic of Enlightenment provides the starting point for our humanist and aesthetic critique via readings of Homer, mythology, philosophy, and religion. Important “non-western” authors might include Aime Cesiare, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, Sylvia Wynter, Gayatri Spivak, and Hamid Dabashi. Satisfies the Connections core requirement. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power gradua-tion requirement. A Precious Barbarism: Enlightenment, Ideology, and     Colonialism A Precious Barbarism: Enlightenment, Ideology,     and Colonialism200 Homer to Hitchcock: The History of Ideas in the Arts  This course serves as the gateway to the Humanities minor; as such it introduces students to the history of Western cultures and ideas as expressed through literary, historical, philosophical, religious, musical, architec-tural, and artistic works. Professor teams may vary the organizational logic and thematic emphases from semester to semester, but in all cases readings and assignments will foreground the minor’s histori-cal scope and two-track formula (Antiquity through the Renaissance, and Renaissance to the present).  By learning to engage the history of Western ideas from the various perspectives afforded by the hu-manistic disciplines, and by learning to read, analyze, and write about the various kinds of texts (verbal, visual, and aural) that have been the 134     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Interdisciplinary Humanitiesconduits for these ideas, students develop the interpretive frameworks and critical vocabularies for more specialized study. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement. 201  The Arts, Ideas and Society   Survey of intellectual developments in western civilization from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century. Emphasis is placed on the relationship between the individual and the state examined through literature and the arts. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.260  It’s Only Rock and Roll: Rock from Cradle to Adolescence   This course is a survey of rock history, from its roots in the mid-1950s, to the end of the “Summer of Love - Flower Power” era, to The Rolling Stones’ disastrous Altamont concerts in late 1969, to the break-up of The Beatles in 1970.  Students examine cultural influences, historical events, and stylistic developments of rock music, primarily in the United States and Great Britain, to gain a wider knowledge and understanding of rock music’s place as a crucial part of the arts and culture of this time period in many parts of the world. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.288 The Ideas of the Bible   Even though the Biblical materials stand at the foundation of the Western tradition, common knowledge of the Bible is at a low point. The popular debate often gets polarized into two extreme positions: the Bible holds all truth, or the Bible is irrelevant. Yet many modern discoveries on archeological sites or in the archives now provide a much clearer idea of the way the Biblical materials are put together over the centuries, and the way the Biblical authors respond to each other, developing, critiquing, and reinterpreting ideas in the political and cultural crises of their times. Students study a selection of materials from both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, not only to appreciate the depth and complexity of what the Bible “says” in its own original contexts, but also to reassess what it “says” to the modern world—with its very different cosmology, anthropology, and political and social structures—about human responsibility to the planet and to fellow human beings about the recognition of human destructiveness and the hope for survival. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.290  Introduction to Cinema Studies   In this course, students develop the expertise necessary  to communicate intelligently about the artistic medium of film. Drawing on the expertise of two professors, students consider key terminology related to mise-en-scene, editing, and sound; apply those concepts to a wide variety of examples from the advent of film to the present; and begin considering critical approaches to the me-dium. In addition to regular class sessions, film screenings are required. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement; counts toward the “Artist as a Humanist” and “Visual Culture” pathways. Offered frequently.317  Liberation and Alienation: Intellectuals in Modern Europe   This course examines the works and times of prominent intellectual critics of modern European society. It centers on the texts of nineteenth-cen-tury writers, theorists, scientists and revolutionaries who  formulated far-reaching analyses of and challenges to modern cultures, practices, values and economies. Special emphasis is placed on the generation of ideas and ideologies of the period, such as materialism, psychoanalysis and Marxism, and their application in culture and the arts. Cross-listed with   A Precious Barbarism: Enlightenment, Ideology, and Colonialism Satisfies the Connections core requirement.201  The History and Literature of the New Testament   All the writ-ings of the New Testament are studied, in order to understand both the critical scholarly questions of date, authorship, purpose, and the impact of these writings and their authors on the emerging Christian communi-ty. Offered frequently.202  Introduction to the Study of World Religions   This course provides an introduction to the vocabulary, methods, and theoretical assumptions of the academic study of religion. By examining several diverse religious communities and traditions—including Lakota Sioux, Southern Pentecostal, Nation of Islam, and Zen Buddhist—we will ex-amine patterns, themes, and issues that scholars commonly encounter across world religions. We will also examine how specific communities give voice to themes found within the larger world religion from which they emerge. In each case, particular attention will be paid to the role of religion in social justice and salvation movements, and in the formation of individual and group identities. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.203  Jesus and the Jesus Traditions   The figure of Jesus has sparked theological debates, artistic expressions, government decrees, religious persecutions, pietistic revivals, and social and moral attitudes, affecting the lives of countless generations. This course addresses an overarching question throughout the semester: How does an educated person in to-day’s society evaluate such conflicting responses? The course draws on current historical and narrative approaches to understand the ‘images’ of Jesus in their respective literary, social, and historical contexts. It ad-dresses some of the following questions. What did Jesus mean to the first interpreters? How did the early Christian communities view Jesus? What do the texts reveal about early Christian attitudes towards out-siders (government, different religious groups, social/moral attitudes)? How has Jesus been perceived in Christian tradition (art, literature, the-ology, ecclesiology) and in the development of western civilization (e.g., literature, the arts, politics, public schools)? The goal is not to give final and definitive answers. Rather, the course seeks 1) to encourage ques-tions regarding the themes, purpose, and significance of the texts; 2) to provide methodological tools to aid such questions; 3) to place these questions and answers amidst the questions and answers of others; and 4) to understand the Jesus traditions both ancient and contemporary in light of their own social, cultural, and literary contexts. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally.204  Religions of the Book: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam   This course surveys the major monotheistic traditions of the world—Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—from their origins to the present day. The course fosters an appreciation of the distinctiveness and inner co-herence of each of these traditions as well as to discern facets of unity among the three. Religious expression assumes many forms and is considered in traditional theological and philosophical texts as well as in political systems and the arts. The class is conducted as a combination of lecture and discussion. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every semester.208  Yoga, Psychedelics and the Ascetic Imperative   This course investigates and attempts to distinguish, identify, and understand the different modes and aspects of yoga, meditation, and ascetic disciplines in a variety of cultural contexts. The class examines the broad influence of the ascetic imperative in culture and criticism—in myth, literature, philosophy, religion, and psychology. Primary texts include Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras, Plato’s Symposium, and Athanasius’s Life of Anthony. Major interpretive authors studied include Nietzsche, Weber, Freud, and Foucault. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.210  Comparative Christianities   This course provides an introduction to Christianity, or rather, ‘Christianities.’ To understand the diversity within Christianity, the course compares and contrasts various historical and contemporary traditions in Christianity: Gnosticism, the Eastern Orthodox Church, medieval Western Latin Christianity, Protestantism in the sixteenth century, African-American Christianities, Pentecostalism, liberation theology, and Christian fundamentalism in the United States. Students come to realize that there is no one single, monolithic ‘Christianity,’ but instead a variety of Christianities which vary geograph-ically, historically, and culturally. The course also examines the way in which gender, race, and class affect religious perspectives upon the human experience. It concludes by examining two social issues which Christians today debate, homosexuality and the ordination of women. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occa-sionally.211 Islam in America This course surveys Muslim life and religious movements connected to Islam in North America, tracing the history of Islam on the continent from the Atlantic slave trade to the post-9/11 era. It investigates the many ways in which Islam, as both a religion and an idea, has appeared on the American horizon and in the American imag-ination. Through course exams, assignments, and papers, students are able to appreciate and reflect concretely in their writing on the cultural and socio-economic differences that have shaped American Muslim views on religion and identity. They do so by citing historic cases, au-tobiographical testimonies, and current observable practices. Through the briefs and presentations they produce, they also take part in a major semester-long group project in which issues of belonging and commu-nity are mapped out in real spaces. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally.184     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  212  The Religion of Islam   With approximately 6 billion adherents to-day, Islam is a world religion that has inspired a vibrant civilization, mas-sive empires, and abiding social institutions throughout the fifteen cen-turies since its inception. This course is an introduction to the religion of Islam and its development in history. Topics covered include: pre-Islamic Arabia and the rise of Islam, Muhammad and the Qur’an, the develop-ment and criticism of hadith, Islamic law (Sharia) and jurisprudence, Islamic theology and philosophy, Sufism, colonialism and modernity, Islamic political thought and jihad, and themes in contemporary Muslim societies (i.e. “lived Islam”). Although the syllabus is designed for stu-dents with no prior knowledge of Islam, it is also engaging for students with a Muslim background. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally.215  Religion and Queer Politics   What has been the role of religion in gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBQT) politics? This course challenges the dominant picture of entrenched opposition between queer lives and religious traditions, and it investigates the complexity and variety of queer and religious engagement during the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. This course covers the historical emergence of sexual and gender identity communities in the United States and the attendant formations of established religious teachings as backdrop and critical context for both opposing and supportive religious involvement LGBT politics. The course examines anti-queer religious responses but also spends significant time covering queer-inclusive religious advocacy, including liberal religious involvement in gay liberation, the formation of queer inclusive churches and synagogues and new spiritual communi-ties such as the Radical Faeries, and religious involvement in political causes from AIDS/HIV activism, hate crimes legislation, and same-sex marriage. Offered occasionally. 220  Spirituality and the Self  What does Beyonce’s Lemonade share in common with St. Augustine’s Confessions? What does Harry Potter teach about spiritual self-mastery? This class investigates contemporary narratives and practices of personal transformation in conver-sation with themes from classical writings about spiritual experience, highlighting how today’s efforts to transform the self borrow from longstanding religious themes. This course helps students develop critical perspectives for ana-lyzing religious and spiritual influences within contemporary culture, includ-ing cultural products and practices that seem not to be religious. At the same time, students also reflect personally on how their own routines and aspirations—from media consumption prac-tices to working out—might be seen and analyzed with those same critical tools from the study of religion. Texts include selections from J.K. Rowling; Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone, Julian of Norwich’s Revelations of Divine Love; Martin Buber, I and Thou; The Autobiography of Malcom X ; B.K.S. Iyengar, Light on Life, James Baldwin, The Fire Next Time, and others. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally.233  Japanese Religious Traditions   This course explores the major expressions of religion in Japanese culture and history, including both popular and elite forms of religious practice and thought. Because Japan is home to a range of religious traditions, the course explores the vari-ous forms that have appeared there not only of Buddhism and Shinto, but also of Taoism, Confucianism, and even Christianity. A primary goal of this course is to develop both an empathetic understanding of Japanese religion and a critical appraisal of its expression in particular historical and cultural contexts. Throughout the course ample time is de-voted to the role of aesthetics in Japanese religion (in film, literature, art, and ritual) as well as to the various ways that religion and the Japanese state have interacted over time. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently. 234  Chinese Religious Traditions   This course provides an intro-duction to the wide range of religious beliefs and practices that have emerged over the course of Chinese history. Topics covered include not only the classic traditions Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, but also such broader examples of religious expression as oracle bone inscriptions, medieval ghost stories, and contemporary practices in lon-gevity. Throughout the course students explore how those in China have understood the world religiously, and how scholars have interpreted the diverse world of Chinese religion. Some of the questions include: What has it meant to be a human in China? What other spirits, ghosts, and divinities inhabit the Chinese religious world? What is included and what is excluded when we use the term “religion,” or even ”China”? How do cultural, historical, and political changes affect religious experience, or a person’s understanding of “ultimate reality”? A primary goal of the course is to develop a broad understanding both of Chinese religious history and of contemporary issues involving religion in China. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.265  Thinking Ethically: What is Justice?   This course provides students with tools of ethical analysis so that they can think critically about pressing contemporary moral issues through the lens of justice. The course focuses on ethical methods from world Christianity and western philosophy. The course introduces both ethical theories and modern justice theories, and examines multicultural perspectives of the long-standing religious and philosophical understanding of justice. It analyzes how social justice concepts have been applied in different cul-tural contexts, including non-western communities. Students examine different models of justice and their implications for contemporary moral issues (e.g. healthcare, social welfare, racism, war, capital punishment, human rights, immigration, refugees, property rights, and the environ-ment). The class includes interactive lectures on justice theories and students actively participate in discussions on selected case studies. Course readings include excerpts from Aristotle, Aquinas, Mill, Pope, Locke, Calvin, Kant, Rawls, Sandel, Nussbaum, Singer, and Hauerwas. Crosslisted with "

The idea of wine, however, is very complicated, since it reflects both wine itself and wine’s complex and dynamic social and economic terror of values, at-titudes, and interests. Because wine intersects social processes in so many ways, the question of which idea of wine will prevail, or how the contractions between and among the different ideas will be resolved or not, has important implications. This course looks closely at the battle for the idea of wine with special attention to its interdisciplinary aspects and conflicts and consideration of how the globalization of wine has intensified the inherent conflicts.

IPE 427," Competing Perspectives on the Material World  Competing Perspectives on the Material World   Many so-ciologists have joined economists in the study of that entity we call the economy. Apart from this interest, however, the two groups share very little in common. The disagreements include the importance of rationali-ty and selfishness, the proper methodologies, the nature of explanation, and even the definition of the field of study. This course surveys the different ways in which economists and sociologists approach the mate-rial world and the key debates between them. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

The second part of the course provides stu-dents with a well-rounded understanding of the political, economic and social aspects of the international financial system and financial crises. This includes political economy analyses of important recent events such as the US credit rating downgrade and the European debt crisis. It is advised that students take "
LAS 380," Around Macondo in Eighty Days  Around Macondo in Eighty Days   This course explores the concept of Modernity as it applies to the creation and development of the modern nation with particular attention to the Latin American region. The role of the local and autochthonous cultures versus global and ex-ternal trends and forces, and the impact of modern inventions and tech-nical developments in an ever-evolving society are examined using lit-erary, historical, and political texts, combined with readings on post-co-lonialism and post-modernism, globalization and neo-liberalism. These texts inform the reading of the English translation of One Hundred Years of Solitude, by Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a novel often read as an allegory of the forces at play in the shaping of modern Latin America.

LAS 387," Art and Revolution in Latin America  Art and Revolution in Latin America   This course com-bines the disciplines of history and art to consider the ways in which artists participated in and created a visual analogue to the political and social transformations wrought by successful revolutions in Latin America. The interaction of art and revolution in Mexico (from the late nineteenth century to the 1940s) forms the foundation of the course. Its revolution (1910-1920) produced the most successful, vibrant, and internationally recognized artistic formation of national identity of the last century. The final third of the course analyzes and compares the similarity explosive changes that occur in revolutionary Cuba from 1959 and in Nicaragua from 1979-1990. These three revolutions demonstrate a connection between art and politics to a rare degree, as artistic expression (painting, prints, photography, and architecture) become fundamental to both creating, reflecting, and challenging the new order.

Students in it not only expand their knowledge of events of American history but also deepen their understanding of the meaning of those events in people’s lives. Students learn how the social categories of race, gender, and class affected individual Americans’ identities and opportunities; how America’s natural environment shaped and was shaped by Americans’ human culture; and how Americans’ ideas and ideals both influenced and reflected their economic, political, and social institutions. To inves-tigate these themes, students read writings by modern historians and analyze a wide variety of historical sources from the past. American Experiences I focuses on the period from European colonization through the end of Reconstruction. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. 153  American Experiences II: 1877-Present   This course explores the experiences and values of America’s diverse peoples. Students in it not only expand their knowledge of the events of American history but also deepen their understanding of the meaning of those events in people’s lives. Students learn how the social categories of race, gender, and class affected individual Americans’ identities and opportunities; how Americans’ ideas and ideals both influenced and reflected their economic, political, and social institutions; and how Americans defined and re-defined national identity in the context of the nation’s changing role in the world. To investigate these themes, students read writings by modern historians and analyze a wide variety of historical sources from the past. American Experiences II focuses on the period from the end of Reconstruction to the Present. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. 200  Doing History: An Introduction   This course is designed to intro-duce prospective majors to the discipline and Department of History. In it, students learn what history is and how historians think and work. The course teaches students to do the two things that historians do: develop interpretations from primary sources and critically evaluate the interpretations advanced by other historians. Emphasis is placed on the methods and skills of reading, analyzing, discussing, and writing history. Reading assignments expose students to a variety of current approaches to history. Writing assignments give students practice in the types of historical writing that are expected of them in upper-division history courses. History 200 is intended to be taken in the sophomore year or as soon as a History major is declared. At least one prior course in History is desirable but not required. Students minoring in History or majoring in other disciplines are also welcome. 224  Russia Since 1861   The course covers Russian Imperial state and society; revolutionary movements; causes of 1905 and 1917 revolutions; Russian and Soviet political cultures; Soviet Union and totalitarianism; Russian and Soviet foreign policy; the collapse of communism and the Soviet empire; post-communist Russian society and politics. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.230  England from the Romans to the Tudors   This course surveys the history of England from the Roman conquest to the end of the Tudor dynasty, following England’s rise from remote imperial backwater to incipient world power.  We begin by reconstructing the successive invasions of the island by Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Normans, and assessing the impact of these conquerors on the people, culture, and institutions of England.  The course then explores the later medieval and early modern English world in depth, reconstructing the experiences of many different groups - women and men, peasants and aristocrats, Christians, Jews, and heretics - and tracking major historical develop-ments like urbanization, the rise of representative institutions, and at-tempts to extend English rule into Wales, Ireland, Scotland, France, and beyond.  We reconstruct the experience of life in premodern England through a wide range of textual and non-textual sources, in-cluding archaeological finds, architecture, law-codes, letters, and poetry, while assignments allow students to hone their research, writing, and ana-lytical skills. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.

Offered every other year.254  African American Voices - A Survey of African American History   This course explores the historical experiences of African Americans in the United States from the colonial period to the present. The class studies the diversity of experiences that have constituted African American life, exploring the lives of individual African Americans, while also looking at the development and evolution of African American communities, and the interactions of African Americans with other Americans. Because racism has played such a significant role in shaping African American lives, students also explore the construction of the concept of “race,” the interrelationship of the political, cultural, social, and intellectual forces that have given meaning to that concept, and the ways African Americans have responded to it across time. The course texts include not only the writings of contemporary historians, but also the historical writings, speeches, and artistic productions of African Americans, with particular emphasis on autobiographies.

It begins with an over-view of the European background and the major indigenous civilizations in what Europeans came to call the New World. The central focus is on the encounter of indigenous and Iberian cultures and the process of conquest, resistance and mutual transformation that ensued over the next three centuries. Attention is also given to the social and economic structures and institutions of the colonies themselves, the development in some regions of plantation economies using slave labor from Africa, and the evolving relationship of Spanish America and Brazil to Europe, culminating in the wars of Independence. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.281  Modern Latin America   Beginning with the transition from colo-nies to independent nations and ending with the political transitions and implementation of neo-liberal policies in the 1990s, this course consid-ers the Latin American region from the perspective of its subordinate incorporation into the world economy, its struggles for democratic in-stitutions and equitable development, and the formation of identities of class, gender, race, and ethnicity. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.291  Modern Africa   This course introduces students to the major events and trends of the past two centuries of African history and ex-plores how those trends and events shaped the experiences of people across the continent.  Major topics include the ending of the Atlantic Slave Trade, colonial incursion, cultural change, economic transfor-mations, the rise of nationalism and the challenges of decolonization.  Students consider how ethnic, gender, religious and other identities shaped individual Africans’ experiences and make comparisons both re-gionally and in terms of Africa’s relationship to the world. To do so, they read a variety of historical sources as well as the work of contemporary historians. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered frequently.293 Early Africa to 1807   This course offers students a broad outline of political, economic and social developments in Africa—topics covered will include ancient trade between Africa and the Mediterranean region, the rise of the great medieval empires of Ghana and Mali, the creation of a distinctive Swahili Coast culture and the impact of slavery and slave trade upon African societies. Second, the course will introduce students to the specific tools used by historians in the study of early Africa. In evaluating how best to write the history of non-literate peoples, students will consider, among other possibilities, the use of historical linguistics, archaeology and oral traditions. They will assess the useful-ness of Islamic and European sources for African history. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirements.   Offered frequently.302  Birth of Europe   This course introduces students to a period of history that was, until recently, commonly referred to as the “Dark Ages.” It uses historical, literary, and archaeological evidence from a variety of early medieval cultures to shed light on what was actually a time of exciting changes, a period which saw the transformation of the Mediterranean-centered Roman world and the rise of vibrant new cultures throughout Europe and the East. Topics include the “barbari-zation” of the Roman world, the Carolingian Renaissance, the role of women in various early medieval societies, the rise of Islamic civiliza-tions in the East and Iberia, and the political, economic, and spiritual reordering of the medieval world during the tenth and early eleventh centuries. In the course of its explorations the class encounters mar-tyrs and missionaries, pagan chieftains and Muslim pirates, Carolingian princesses and Viking raiders, and follows the development of early medieval culture up to the eve of the High Middle Ages. Offered every other year.304  Renaissance Europe   This course examines the great cultural revolution known as the Renaissance from a number of perspectives, considering new developments in the arts, political theory, historical awareness, concepts of the self, science, and technology as interre-lated phenomena. The primary focus is on the towns of Northern Italy that served as the cradle of the Renaissance, but consideration is also given to the spread of Renaissance ideals and innovations into Northern Europe and the Americas in the course of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Offered every other year.305  Women and Gender in Pre-Modern Europe  This course ex-amines the construction of gender in European contexts from Late Antiquity through the medieval and early modern period, addressing historical continuity and change in definitions of feminities and masculin-ities, as well as the development of related ideas about marriage, family, and sexuality. Students gain an understanding of how gender intersect-ed with social, economic, political, educational, and religious structures in premodern Europe, and consider the merits of various historical approaches to gender over the past sever-al decades. Special topics to be considered include the relationship between gender, sanctity, and sexuality in premodern Christianity, the development of western mar-riage models, courtly love and its paradoxes, gender non-conformity, and challenges to traditional gender roles in Renaissance humanists and Protestant reformers. Counts as a Gender and Queer Studies elective. Offered every other year. 307  The Crusades   The military campaigns that comprised the Crusades lasted only two centuries, but their impact was far more lasting, and the post-medieval legacy of the Crusades continues to be a matter of debate. This course focuses on the European military ex-peditions to the Levant between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries, attempting to understand these events and their consequences from a number of perspectives. Because a main goal of the class is to recon-struct the worlds of the crusaders (the world they came from, as well as the world they made in the Levant), students also gain some familiarity with premodern European society, the history of the Holy Land, medie-val Christianity and Islam, theories of holy war in each faith tradition, and the history of interfaith relations. Includes a substantial final research paper. Offered every other year.311  Age of Reformation   Modern people tend to think of the Reformation in strictly religious terms, as the movement that divided the medieval church into Catholic and Protestant camps. The scope of what are more properly termed Europe’s Reformations was, in fact, much broader: Luther’s initial attack on the Catholic Church in 1517 touched off a series of revolutions that divided states, rulers, and neigh-bors against one another and ultimately altered the balance of power across Europe. The teachings of both Protestant and Catholic reformers transformed civic life, introduced new models of citizenship and govern-ment, and forever changed the family lives of early modern Europeans. This course focuses on Northern Europe during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, paying special attention to the course of the Reformation in the German states, Swiss cantons, the Netherlands, France, and England. Offered every other year.314  War and Society in Premodern Europe   This course addresses war as a major force in European history from the early Middle Ages to c.1500, with a special focus on Northwestern Europe.  Taking a ‘war and society’ approach, the course focus less on strategies, tactics, and gen-eralship than on the ways in which war has shaped, and been shaped UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     125Historyby, variables such as social and political hierarchies, gender roles, and religious belief. Students explore the relationship between war and social, cultural, political, and technological change, and attempt to re-construct the experience of war for combatants and non-combatants.  Specific topics to be considered include the role of warfare in shaping early medieval polities, the rise of a knightly class and related social de-velopments, the culture of chivalry and martial display, and the advent of new, increasingly destructive methods of waging war in the later Middle Ages.  Students complete a substantial research project in the second half of the semester. Offered occasionally.316  The British Empire   This course examines the British Empire both as a political and economic institution and as a lived reality for millions of individuals of widely diverse backgrounds.  It acquaints students with those broad economic, political, social, ecological and technological fac-tors that permitted the Empire’s rise (and those that led to its more recent decline).  It also examines the interactions and experiences through which new identities and cultures were created, both in Britain and abroad. The course includes material on the Caribbean, India, Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia, and to a lesser extent, North America. For majors, this course counts as a unit in European history. Offered frequently.  317  Liberation and Alienation: Intellectuals in Modern Europe   This course examines the works and times of prominent intellectual critics of modern European society.  It centers on the texts of nineteenth-cen-tury writers, theorists, scientists and revolutionaries who formulated far-reaching analyses of and challenges to modern cultures, practices, values and economics. Special emphasis is placed on the generation of ideas and ideologies of the period, such as materialism, psychoanalysis and Marxism, and their application in culture and the arts.

It examines the products of individual and collective experience and creativity in a variety of ways. Using historical and an-thropological texts, the course provides a brief overview of historical periods and legacies, and considers how anthropologists have under-stood the cultures of urban and rural, racial and ethnic existence. In addi-tion, using a series of literary works, students reflect on the cultural and national identity, moral and religious values, and individual experience of Latin Americans as well as the cultural, intellectual, and linguistic influ-ence of these people in the United States. Classes are organized around discussion and occasional presentations by guest speakers. In addition to exams, students write several short evaluations of readings and are involved in several group presentation projects.

REL 301," Consciousness and the Bourgeoisie  Consciousness and the Bourgeoisie   “Know thyself” is a maxim central to the religious quest, but individuals who are intensely and urgently driven to know themselves often occupy the outskirts of ordinary society. Although these “outsiders” are a part of their culture and contribute to their culture, they no longer share the common values of their society. The course seeks to explore the role of outsiders (those who desire inner freedom and transformation) in the context of bour-geois society. The first half of the course draws on ancient materials (Epic of Gilgamesh, The Oresteia, and Plato’s Republic) in discussing ideas of ontology, psychology, consciousness, and transformation. The second half of the course relies on novels and novellas by Ouspensky, Hesse, and Mann for a discussion of bourgeois attitudes toward the outsider and toward the outsider’s struggle to become an individual who confronts the habitual, unconscious, and mechanical patterns of exis-tence.

STS 314," Cosmological Thought   Cosmological Thought   Cosmology is the attempt to under-stand what the whole universe is, how the universe came into being, and what forms or structures organize it. Cosmology had its origins in myth, but soon incorporated elements of astronomy, physics, and phi-losophy. This course is a study of cosmological thought in its historical and cultural context, from the cosmologies of the ancient and medieval worlds to twentieth-century cosmology. Throughout, the course stress-es not only the scientific content of the various cosmologies that have contended for primacy, but also their historical origins and their philo-sophical implications.

STS 318," Science and Gender  Science and Gender   This course explores gender from a scientific perspective. Taking a comparative approach, students critically examine the biological and experiential / social factors that influence sex differences, gender roles, and sexual preference in human and non-human animals, as well as sexual orientation and gender identity in humans. Students consider how variation in sex and gender may evolve through natural and sexual selection, and how human perceptions of gender feedback to influence the scientific study of animals. Policy and ethical implications of scientific research on gender are also considered. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

Relevant topics are used to illustrate funda-mental concepts. The course takes a thematic approach in which the chosen examples relate to a particular topic. The use of a theme topic highlights the interconnection of the various fields of biology and illus-trates the complexity of relevant problems. Laboratory is required. Credit for  Science and GenderOther courses may be added to this list on a semester-by-semester basis.Program Course Offerings Unless otherwise specified, each course carries 1 unit of credit and is offered at least once each academic year.201  Introduction to Gender, Queer, and Feminist Studies  This course serves as an introduction to Gender, Queer and Feminist Studies. It surveys the history of feminisms, and then explores the rise and trajectories of gender studies and queer studies. The course engag-es with the ways in which gender, sexuality, race, class, ability/disability, and other facets of identity intersect with each other. Students will con-sider the implications of activism as well as the academic development of these disciplines, and they will engage with the ways that the read-ings touch upon their own lives. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power gradua-tion requirement. Offered every semester.220  What Is Queer?  Rather than approaching ¿queer¿ as a designated set of identities or a defined area of study, this course explores an on-going question, asking: what kinds of bodies, desires, histories, and pol-itics does queer describe? This inquiry includes Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex (LGBTI) lives and histories. However, students also look beyond these social identities to broadly investigate sexualities and genders that fall outside the cultural norm and analyze how these norms are constructed and contested. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered every other year.291  Gender and Queer Studies Publication  0.25 activity unit  Gender and Queer Studies Publication is an activity credit for participation in a campus publication of literary and artistic materials related to ques-tions of gender and sexuality. The program requires editing, reviewing, criticism, and oral discussion of manuscripts and artwork on a weekly basis. The program also includes active promotion and publicizing of the Publication as well as managing the Publication organization as a whole. The course must be taken as pass/fail grading. Offered each year.310  Histories and Theories of Sexuality  What does it mean to study sexuality?  Does it change over time and space?  How does identity affect sexuality?  This seminar course addresses these and other ques-tions through an interdisciplinary approach that draws on theoretical perspectives from cultural studies, history, science, sociology, and anthropology. The course pays particular attention to how the category “sexuality” relates to concepts of race, gender, nation, class, globaliza-tion, and politics. Through authors such as the Marquis de Sade, Freud, Malinowski, Foucault, Butler, and others, the course explores how terms such as “women” and “men,” “femininity” and “masculinity,” as well as “homosexuality” and “heterosexuality” have structured people’s experiences and their perceptions of sexuality at large and the central position it occupies within culture. The course first covers some critical readings from feminist, queer, and scientific perspectives in relation to sexuality. Then, armed with these tools, students address key topics in the field around science and sexology, histories of sexuality, reproduc-tive politics, queer theory and pedagogy, health, hook-up culture, body modification, sexual harassment and #MeToo, and global issues in sexu-ality.

STS 330," Evolution and Society Since Darwin  Evolution and Society Since Darwin   his course examines the historical relationship between the theory of evolution and society in the twentieth century, with an emphasis on Britain, Germany, and the United States since 1870. Students examine a range of efforts to apply evolution theory to human society (including social Darwinism, eugen-ics, scientific racism, and the biology of war and peace), and place these efforts in historical context. In doing so, students study the complex re-lationship between science and society, and the place of science in the intellectual, social, and cultural history of the twentieth century. Satisfies the Connections core requirement. Connections34     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  , 370.

STS 333," Evolution and Ethics  Evolution and Ethics   The study of evolution and ethics—at the intersections between biology, the human sciences and philos-ophy—has received a lot of attention in recent years. News stories abound that give, in sound byte form, the (often controversial) ethical implications of conclusions regarding evolutionary theory. Drawing upon historical and philosophical approaches, this course provides students with an interdisciplinary framework from which to understand and study such debates. The course examines the historical context of previous discussions regarding the implications of the theory of evolution for ethical theories, and examines modern debates regarding the normative implications that may or may not result from different interpretations of the conclusions of evolutionary biology. Satisfies the Connections core requirement.

Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.102  Freedom and the Self   This course covers a range of philosoph-ic problems centering on issues of personhood and rational agency. Readings are drawn from both classic and contemporary sources and address such topics as freedom of the will, personal identity, knowledge of the self, weakness of will and self-deception. Offered frequently.103 Philosophy of Religion  The course assesses the reasonableness of various forms of religious belief and of irreligion. Noted historical and contemporary authors are read. Students attempt to develop personal views on the truth of religion and its place in life.  Offered occasionally.104 Existentialism   Existentialism describes an influential set of views that gained prominence in Europe following World War II, stressing radi-cal human freedom and possibility, as well as concomitant responsibility and anxiety, in a world bereft of transcendent significance. This course examines the nineteenth-century philosophical roots of such views, their leading twentieth-century philosophical and theological expression, and a few of their most compelling incarnations in literature. Offered frequently.106  Language, Knowledge, and Power  This course investigates the ways in which power relations—such as racism, sexism, and ableism—structure two significant areas of individual and collective behavior: lan-guage and knowledge. It shows the necessity of philos-ophizing in crit-ical engagement with the world by connecting social phenomena with social scientific theories. It also shows philosophy’s strength in making fundamental inquiries and bridging academic disciplines by drawing on diverse types of empirical evidence. Satisfies Social Scientific Approaches core requirement. Satisfies Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.105  Neuroethics and Human Enhancement  This course examines the ethical, political, and philosophical questions raised by some of the new forms of human enhancement made available by breakthroughs in science and technology, from fields like neuroscience and genetic engi-neering. For example: Should parents be allowed to use genetic screen-ing or modification to create “designer children,” either for the purpose of avoiding diseases and other ailments or to select desired traits such as their child’s intelligence, athletic ability, or good looks? Should we pursue immortality or, failing that, radically extended lifespans? Is there any important ethical difference between artificial and natural intelli-gence, and will the former soon surpass the latter? What justification is there, if any, for regarding the use of steroids in athletics as a form of cheating while regarding the use of weight training regimens as fair game? Is the goal of human enhancement compatible with the pursuit of social equality? What constitutes the self, as opposed to the tools or pieces of technology that a self uses?210 Ancient Greek Philosophy  A survey of the origins of Western phi-losophy in Ancient Greece, beginning with the Presocratics and covering Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and Hellenistic philosophy. In this course stu-dents are introduced to the answers some of the most influential ancient philosophers have given to the question: “How can we be happy?” In addition to learning what these philosophers thought, students are stimu-lated to think about these questions from their own modern perspective, and reflect on the extent to which their modern viewpoint differs. Finally, but not least importantly, students learn to read and interpret texts that were written millennia ago. In the process, they encounter argumenta-tive techniques that are still as current as the theses defended through them. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.220  17th- and 18th-Century Philosophy   European philosophers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries struggled to make sense of ordinary perceptual experience in light of the emerging mathematical physics that culminated in Newton. This new physics presented a pic-ture of the world according to which things in space and time are not as PhilosophyUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     163they appear to the senses, and thus overturned the Aristotelian world-view endorsed by the Church since the Middle Ages. The philosophical issues of this period concern the nature of knowledge of the world and how it is acquired. Also included are various accounts of the mind and of its intellectual and sensory capacities.230  Philosophy of Mind   This course introduces central issues in the philosophy of mind, especially the relation between mind and body—the brain, in particular—and the nature of consciousness. Other topics may include the possibility of artificial intelligence, the nature of psycholog-ical explanation, self-knowledge, psychopathology and psychopharma-cology, psychoanalysis, and the concept of a person. Course materials reflect scientific developments in such fields as psychology, neurobiolo-gy, medicine, linguistics, and computer engineering. 240  Formal Logic  A study of the principles and techniques of deduc-tive logic, taking the formal approach that prevails in contemporary practice. Arguments are paraphrased in a formal language and elements of that language are interpreted by being assigned certain simple math-ematical structures. Topics include the concepts of consistency, logical consequence, and proof; the logic of truth-functions, quantifiers, and identity; and an introductory consideration of theorems about the formal language and their interpretations themselves (what is called metalog-ic). The nature of logic, its role in reasoning, and its epistemological standing are considered philosophically. Satisfies the Mathematical Approaches core requirement.250 Moral Philosophy  This course examines a number of ethical theories - theories attempting to provide a systematic account of our beliefs about what is right and wrong, good and bad. The course examines a range of answers to questions like the following: What makes for a good life? What, if anything, is of value? What does morality require? Should we care about moral requirements and, if so, why? Is there a connection between moral-ity and freedom? In addition to a careful study of various classic views, we will consider recent defenses and critiques of these views.285  Environmental Ethics   This course focuses on ethical issues that arise in the context of human relationships to nature and to non-human living things. The course explores questions such as the following: What is nature? Is nature intrinsically valuable? Should wilderness be preserved? What is biodiversity and should it be promoted? What are our moral obligations to non-human animals and to future generations? What ethical considerations arise in facing global poverty and overpopu-lation? Offered frequently.292 Basics of Bioethics  This course is an examination of Western philosophical understandings of moral issues brought on by advances in health care, science and technology. In this course, students will learn the “Principles approach” to bioethics, as well as other ethical approaches to the difficult moral issues raised by contemporary medical science and its clinical applications.

STS 340," Finding Order in Nature  Finding Order in Nature   Our knowledge of nature is just that: “our knowledge.” The activity we call “science” is created and pur-sued by humans in historical time. It certainly reflects the natural world, and is limited by what there is for us to see (or detect where we cannot see). But science also reflects human preoccupations, and is shaped powerfully by what we want to see and to know. This leads us to an interesting question: what and how much of science is “out there” and what and how much is “made up”? That is the subject of this course: looking at the “out there” and the “made up” in physics, biology, ge-ology, natural history, and in that branch of mathematical investigation called “complexity theory.” Satisfies the Connections core requirement. : Finding Order in Nature (Connections Core)UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     133Interdisciplinary Humanities Finding Order in Nature"

STS 347," Better Living Through Chemistry: Studies in the History     and Practice of Chemistry  Better Living Through Chemistry: Studies in the History and Practice of Chemistry   “Better things for better living...through chemistry” was a popular slogan used by DuPont in the mid-to-late twentieth century to market laboratory-developed products. Increasingly, concerns have been raised about the merits and conse-quences of chemicals in our food, goods, and environment. This class analyzes how we know what we know about chemistry, and how stud-ies of the very small shape fundamental questions about the world, e.g. what is natural, what is artificial, does the difference matter, and if so in what contexts?  By investigating a series of historical episodes that highlight some of the key intellectual, social, and political challenges of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this course examines how we learn about, modify, and relate to our environment chemically. From the development of the periodic table to the study of pollution, this course encourages students  to gain an appreciation for the science of chemistry while engaging in cross-disciplinary dialogue about ways in which chemistry affects our daily lives.

STS 348," Strange Realities: Physics in the Twentieth Century  Strange Realities: Physics in the Twentieth Century   In the early Twentieth Century, new experimental evidence encouraged physicists to abandon a consistent and nearly complete description of nature. They replaced common sense notions about the physical world with strange realities based on the new theories of relativity and quan-tum mechanics. As the physicists’ new explanations of nature grew increasingly counter-intuitive, it became harder for non-physicists to understand precisely what physicists where doing. Without using higher mathematics, this course explores quantum mechanics and relativity as they describe the nature of matter and energy and the structure of space and time. It also addresses how physicists struggled to under-stand the philosophical implications of the new physical theories, how they worked to express their strange descriptions of nature to both public and professional audiences, and how they maintained public sup-port for their increasingly expensive explorations of nature.

STS 370," Science and Religion: Historical Perspectives  Science and Religion: Historical Perspectives   Over the centuries the traditions of both science and religion have attempted to improve our understanding of ourselves, society, and the natural world. This course examines the relationship between science and religion. It asks students to critically analyze the various models that have been proposed to characterize that relationship—from one of conflict to co-operation—using a series of historical case studies. Through developing a historical understanding of how people have viewed these important traditions, students obtain a nuanced background from which to develop their own assessment of the relationship between these extraordinarily influential ways of knowing.

This Bulletin lists all courses in the curriculum in order to convey the richness of the wide variety of interests and expertise the faculty bring to the academic program at Puget Sound. Seminars in Scholarly InquiryPurposeIn these first-year seminars, students increase their ability to develop ef-fective arguments by learning to frame questions around a focused topic, to assess and support claims, and to present their work to an academic audience both orally and in writing. As part of understanding scholarly conversations, students learn to identify the most appropriate sources of information and to evaluate those sources critically. Over the course of two seminars, students—with increasing independence—contribute to these conversations and produce a substantive scholarly project. To be taken in the first year. May be taken only to fulfill the core requirement. An approved first-year seminar can simultaneously fulfill the Knowledge, Power, and Identity graduation requirement. A course labeled SSI1/SSI2 in the following list has two versions, one satisfying the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 1 requirement and the other satisfying the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 2 requirement.

Seminar offerings vary from term to term.SSI1/SSI2 101  Dionysus & the Art of Theatre   Ancient Greeks had the same name for the god of theatre, wine, and chaos: Dionysus. They used this god to try to understand life’s craziness, for the ways in which human joy and suffering are so often intertwined: Why, for example, do human beings so regularly destroy what they most love? In this Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry, students study theatre as literature and art: analyz-ing plays, reading commentary, attending live theatre, and performing scenes from the dramas they have read—all in service of developing the intellectual habits necessary to write and speak effectively and with integrity.

Through anal-ysis of religious texts, students study the dynamics of classical rhetoric, including the three appeals (ethos, pathos, logos), the three branches (forensic, deliberative, epideictic), the five cannons (invention, arrange-ment, style, memory, delivery), and the six parts of a speech (exordium, narration, division, proof, refutation, peroration). Students perform close rhetorical analyses and criticisms on a variety of religious texts and speeches, make regular oral presentations in class (both in groups and individually), and engage in group debate and discussion in order to ac-quire practical skills in the art of persuasion and public speaking.

Our ancestors were nomadic, of course, and as far as we can tell, settled humans have continued to feel the itch to explore and move beyond the boundaries of their known world. We have traveled so much that it would not be entirely unreasonable to call our species homo peripateticus. This course engages theories of travel—drawn from a range of academic disciplines such as anthropology, history, and philosophy—and examine some seminal instances of travel writing (from Herodotus, the “father” of both History and travel writing to Columbus to contemporary writers such as James Baldwin and Orhan Pamuk). In each instance, students test a theory against one or more case. Affiliate department: English. Satisfies the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 1 core requirement.SSI2 104  Travel Writing and The Other   The course focus is “Travel Writing & the Other.” Because the field of travel writing is so extensive, students hone in on a smaller slice of the topic: the relations between dominant and dominated peoples that originated during the colonial expansion of Europe. The theoretical frameworks students engage in in the early part of the term draw on this encounter and are the shared foundation for the semester. As the semester progresses, students develop independent topics and projects that lie within the orbit of the larger topic. Affiliate department: English.

The American West spans a huge area of land and has meant many things to many people—at the same time, though, “the West” is a meaningful concept within American culture. In this course, students begin developing the intellectual habits necessary to write and speak effectively and with integrity, through focusing on interdisciplinary perspectives on the American West as an “imagined” place.

To the Romans, she was the foreign queen who tried to steal their empire and who represented the most dangerous threat to their civilization in 200 years; to the Egyptians she was a goddess incarnate, the universal mother, and a liberator who came to free them from oppression. But equally fascinating has been the reception of Cleopatra’s image: to Chaucer she was the model of a good wife; to Shakespeare she was a tragic lover; to painters of the Renaissance she was a passive victim; to the Romantics she was a femme fatale; to post-Enlightenment colonial-ists she was an exotic Easterner; to Hollywood she has been a tempt-ress, a sex-kitten, and a vamp. This course examines both the facts known about Egypt’s most famous queen, and how and why she has been reinterpreted over the centuries to suit the social, racial, and gen-der needs of different cultures.

Film texts will provide the basis for critical examination of public disputation about the politics of public memory and collective identity. The course is concerned with both argument through film and argument about film in other public venues. The course explores the role of popular and independent film in shaping or contesting public perspective on what it means to be a nation; public disputes over what counts as national interests; and public disputes over who counts as a citizen with fully endowed rights. The course links film and national iden-tity to gender, race, and social class. Some of the films viewed in this course have an R rating. Affiliate department: Communication Studies.

SSI1 110  Examining Dogs Through the Lens of Science   Humans share their homes with dogs, spend billions of dollars every year on their needs, and worry about what they are feeling. Although dogs and humans have been sharing their lives for thousands of years, most people do not realize that such an intimate association between two different species of animals is highly unusual. How, when, and why did this association come about? Of all animals to domesticate and bring into our homes, why did early humans choose a predator? What do dogs know about humans and what do humans really know about what dogs think and feel? This course introduces students to essential elements of academic discourse. Through learning about the evolution and social cognition of dogs, students learn to distinguish between different types of sources (scholarly v. popular; primary v. secondary) and practice the art of close reading. Students also gain experience using sources judiciously and effectively to build arguments and support a position. Affiliate department: Biology.

How, when, and why did this highly unusual association between two very different species evolve? What is the biological basis for the tremendous diversity in the shapes and sizes of dogs originate? What does science tell us about what dogs know about humans? How do scientists figure out what digs think and feel? In this second semester Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry, students address these questions by examining dogs through the lens of science while practicing and building upon the skills of close reading, evaluating sources, and crafting effective arguments. Students also learn how to search for and use appropriate sources as they embark on a major re-search project on one of the many interesting aspects of dogs. Affiliate department: Biology.

The main focus is a number of existential questions and different at-tempts, past and present, to answer these questions. The central ques-tion of the course is: What gives life meaning? Some philosophers have argued that meaning is to be found in one of the following: the pursuit of pleasure of one’s own happiness, the pursuit of justice or the common good, religion, the pursuit of knowledge, the pursuit of some other value (like artistic value or human excellence); while other have argued that life has no meaning (life is absurd). In addition, the following questions are examined: Is freedom of some sort necessary for a meaningful life? Would life have meaning if we lived forever? Is it rational to fear death? Does causing someone to exist always benefit that person? Is letting life go extinct bad? Readings for this course include a number of exis-tentialist writers (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, de Bevouvoir), some excerpts from classic writers (Plato, Aristotle, Epicurus), and a number of contemporary writers (Nagel, Williams, Feldman, Nozick, Parfit, Taylor, Wolf).

Beginning with intro-ductory historical and theoretical frameworks, students examine a vari-ety of contemporary forms of popular culture: popular religious symbols and rituals, secular festivals, music, dance, food, and sports. Students explore the tensions between elite and popular cultures; popular culture as a resistance or opposition; attempts by the state to manage popular culture as a symbol of national identity or a form of social control; the re-lation of popular culture to mass and commercial culture; and the migra-tions of cultural forms between Latin American countries and the rest of the world.

To be-gin, students read several introductory essays by practitioners of the digital humanities about what they do and why, and what they have learned about the promise and limitations of these new approaches to the study of literature.  For the balance of the semester students read, analyze (in both traditional ways and using some of the new tools and methods), discuss, and write about a challenging collection of readings—major works of fiction, drama, and poetry. The numerous “labs” give students hands-on experience performing micro- and mac-ro-directed text analytics, building annotated maps and network visual-izations, and developing and delivering multi-media presentations will serve as the focus of four substantial individual argumentative essays, including one longer research paper, and two multimedia projects.

This seminar focuses on the study of popular visual images as public argument. Students examine the political econ-omy (ownership, production, dissemination), engage in a textual/visual analysis (what meanings are embedded), and examine audience recep-tion of black film (how do audiences understand and use these media images). Students explore how these films function as public argument advocating particular views of black identity while contesting counter arguments as part of a larger agenda of promoting blacks and shaping US public life.

Students examine forgiveness as a relational and communicative process along with the implications of forgiving between dyads, small groups, and society at large. In addition, alterna-tive post-transgression options such as unforgiveness and revenge that are commonly depicted in opposition to forgiveness are considered. Ultimately, students work to uncover the light and dark sides of both forgiveness and revenge during an examination of these relational pro-cesses. Affiliate department: Communication Studies.

Students learn about how they think, how others think (in both scholarly and non-scholarly ways), and how to effectively interpret and create forms of written and oral communication. They learn important skills of distinguishing between description, summary, and analysis, and be-tween various sources of information (scholarly vs. popular, primary vs. secondary). The vehicle used in the course for developing these skills is a focused study of epistemologies of the natural world. Students explore the ways that human communities have related to, utilized, and conceptualized the flora and fauna around them by examining different sources of knowledge (scientific, indigenous, based on lived experience, popular) about the relationships between people, plants, and animals. Students study this from various points of view, and discuss how differ-ent types of knowledge function in how we construct our understand-ings about the people-plant-animal triad. Understanding how knowledge is formed in this one domain (the natural world) will be helpful in seeing how knowledge can be similarly constructed in other domains of inquiry. Topic-wise, the course examines how different types of economies have engendered different relationships between people, plants, and animals, by taking an historical-anthropological approach, considering human communities of the past as well as the present. Topics covered include domestication, traditional foraging, concepts of animal welfare, cultural values of reciprocity with the plant and animal worlds, urban foraging, and contemporary issues of trade in and conservation of flora and fauna. By examining cross-cultural perspectives, including their own, students use both macro- and micro-lens approaches. Affiliate de-partment: Sociology and Anthropology.

The Gay Liberation Movement   In 1960, ho-mosexuality was considered a mental illness and sex between men (and sometimes between women) was a crime in every state. A 1967 CBS News poll found that 2/3rds of Americans said they reacted to homo-sexuality with “disgust, discomfort, or fear.” In these days of marriage equality, it can be difficult to understand the challenges lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people faced in attempting to improve their lives. This course exams the gay liberation movement beginning with the Stonewall riots of June 1969. To understand what the riots meant, students will simulate a meeting just after Stonewall, playing the parts of people from various factions seeking to work together to improve the lives of LGBT people. Students will use the early class information and experiences to discover their own area of research in-terest related to the gay liberation movement. Students will consider the nature of LGBTQ history in the mid-20th century and what this history suggests for our current society. The class requires the use of primary documents found in the Archive of Sexuality and Gender and other sources to create a research paper addressing an important question related to gay liberation.

The course is grounded on the premise that all we cre-ate—including cultures, political and economic systems, and of course gender—is accomplished through communication. Students learn that biological difference between the sexes are really very few, and exam-ine how and why masculinity and femininity are socially constructed and maintained.

Who was Albert Einstein? This course examines his personal and sci-entific life as well as his legacy. Einstein’s research in physics revolu-tionized our understanding of space and time, produced a new theory of gravity that underpins modern cosmology, and contributed to the development of quantum theory. A German national who renounced his citizenship as a teenager only to take a distinguished job in Berlin, a pacifist who opposed WWI but urged President Roosevelt to start a nuclear-weapons program, a non-religious Jew who championed free-dom of conscience but turned down the presidency of Israel, Einstein embodies many of the contradictions of the twentieth century. By ex-amining Einstein’s life in its historical context, students analyze a range of issues: how does society (e.g., through its religious beliefs, econom-ics, and military interests) shape science, and how does science shape society, affecting institutions, cultural values, and national and personal identity?

As the primary church of Constantinople, it was the meeting ground of the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry14     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  emperor, the patriarch, and the populace, and a treasure trove of holy relics sought out by pilgrims who flocked to the Byzantine capital. After the Ottoman Turks conquered Constantinople in 1453, Hagia Sophia was refurbished and rededicated as a mosque, and it functioned as such until it became a museum in 1935. This course explores ideas related to this single but fundamental monument of world heritage across multiple cultures and periods and from the perspective of multiple disciplines in order to provide students an opportunity to engage with the process of scholarly inquiry. By completing extensive reading and writing assign-ments, students amplify their skills in creating effective arguments, synthesizing complex ideas based on multiple sources, and deepen their skills in critiquing primary and secondary sources.

Landscape, History, and Identity in the Pacific Northwest   In his novel Ecotopia, Ernest Callenbach envi-sioned Northern California, Oregon, and Washington separating from the USA to become a breakaway “green” republic. Using this vision of the Northwest as a sustainable society as a touchstone, this course explores the multifaceted relationship between human identity and landscape (or place) in the region over the last century. Probing historical documents, visual representations, and literature, students investigate how different peoples have encountered, experienced, and repre-sented the environment in the Pacific Northwest and how, in turn, the environment has shaped their sense of who they are. Additional topics may include the wilderness idea, globalization, and the way that social divisions such as gender and race have intersected with the process of making and re-making places in the region.

SSI1 123  Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo: Lives of Art and Politics   During the first half of the 20th century, Diego Rivera was known as Mexico’s most famous and influential living artist, and Frida Kahlo was known mostly as his wife. Soon after their deaths in the mid-20th centu-ry, Kahlo became known as Mexico’s most famous and influential artist, and Rivera was known mostly as her husband. This first-year seminar examines Mexico’s most famous modern couple and their changing critical fortunes at three levels: biographical; artistic; and political. The questions the course asks and the answers pursued are informed by the disciplines of history, art history and the interdisciplinary endeavor of the humanities. Questions include: Who were these two individuals, and how were their lives as a couple shaped by socially constructed gender roles? What was the nature of their distinct artistic production, and how was the work of each shaped by gender and by the work of the other?

What is the likelihood that others exist in the cosmos? Can they visit or communicate with earth? Where are they? This seminar examines the last fifty years of the sci-entific search for intelligent life off the earth. The occurrence of intelli-gence on a planet depends on astrophysical, biological, and environmen-tal factors. Students investigate these factors and attempt to estimate the number of civilizations within the galaxy. The seminar also examines the view that humans are truly the only intelligent life in the galaxy based on the lack of extraterrestrial artifacts within the solar system.

What is the perfect society? Is it possible to achieve such a society?  This course examines how selected writers and communitarians have answered these questions in theory, fiction, and practice. The SSI1 course studies the themes of utopia-nism and anti-utopianism in Western thought from ancient times to the twenty-first century. Readings for the SSI1 version vary but may include Plato’s Republic, More’s Utopia, Voltaire’s Candide, Gilman’s Herland, Zamyatin’s We, Atwood’s Handmaid’s Tale, and documents from actual utopian communities. The SSI2 version will emphasize researching communitarian societies in American history. Affiliate department for SSI1 version: Humanities. Affiliate department for SSI2 version: History.

In this course students explore the possibility that some of these mythological accounts may be based on actual events that occurred in the distant past. The course focuses mainly on Mesopotamian, Greek, and Biblical myths but also includes material from the Pacific Northwest and other cultures. The course includes a re-quired weekend field trip to examine evidence of catastrophic flooding. Affiliate department: Geology.

If you teach a man to fish, he will eat for a lifetime.” What if the “man” being taught is a woman? What if the “fishing” being learned is a form of literacy (whether alphabetic literacy, health literacy, or economic literacy)? For many reasons, women are disproportionately represented among the world’s poor and illiterate populations, and gender roles for both men and women contribute to social inequities as well as possibili-ties for successful international development. Increasingly, development experts agree that efforts to reduce poverty must take into account cultural norms and gender roles—for both men and women—and that literacy education is key to this process. But what forms of literacy should be learned? Who should make the choice? How do rising literacy rates affect gender roles, religious traditions, health expectations, and resource usage? Students in this course engage in discussions of varied Seminar in Scholarly InquiryUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     15reading materials including a novel, policy documents, theory about the effects and nature of literacy, and ethnographic studies of men and women engaged in literacy learning around the world.

SSI1 127  “Why Beethoven?”   “Why Beethoven?” was a question the composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein asked himself in an imaginary conversation published in his book, The Joy of Music. More than half a century later we are still asking the same question. Why has Beethoven played such a pivotal role in the history of classical music, the world of ideas as a whole, and in popular culture? Why is he “a ubiquitous icon in all corners of American society,” as described by the scholar Michael Broyles? This seminar attempts to offer some answers about this towering figure in Western culture. Through critical examina-tion of representative works and through important biographical studies, film, and a Broadway play, this course will explore issues that include the nature of genius, the compositional process of Beethoven’s music, the connections between creativity and suffering, and the presence of Beethoven in American culture.

For millennia now philosophers have debated this question, proposing a number of starkly different accounts of human nature in the process. More recently scientists have gotten in on the action as well, bringing empirical results to bear on various hypotheses regarding what human beings are like. This course examines the interaction between philosophical and scientif-ic approaches to the study of human nature. Topics include the following: Which features of human minds are innate? What is the relation between the language a person speaks and the way in which that person con-ceptualizes the world? What does evolution entail about human nature? Is the existence of free will compatible with various scientific findings regarding human beings? What are the moral and political implications of different views of human nature? Do men and women have fundamen-tally different natures? What is the relation between human nature and religion? The course examines works by Aristotle, Hobbes, Rousseau, Marx, Darwin, and Mead, as well as many contemporary philosophers and scientists. Affiliate department: Philosophy.

For the past forty years China has been in almost constant po-litical and cultural turmoil, experiencing the dawn of a republican era, warlord rule, invasion by Japan, and a bloody civil war. The Communists brought an end to the warfare but inaugurated an era of great change to both state and society. This course examines Chinese history under Mao Zedong, focusing on the process and experience of the Chinese Communist Revolution. Topics explored include Mao’s life history, the philosophical underpinnings of the revolution, the ways in which the revolution was experienced by people of different backgrounds, and the social and cultural legacy of Mao’s vision.

Freedom requires practice, discipline, and an understanding of ‘the rules,’ so that one may use, manipulate, and break the rules; thus students study the arts of grammar, rhetoric, and logic—the foundational skills of the liberal arts—so that they may speak, reason, and practice freedom more effectively. Students test their new-ly acquired skills through close reading and analysis of texts from the Greek tragedy, comedy, history, rhetoric, and philosophy. Students put new skills into action through daily discussions, weekly debates, and performances of Greek drama. Students also participate in a four-week role-playing simulation of the Athenian assembly in which students have to decide on the best form of government, putting their notions of freedom into practice. This course thus offers students an authentic foundation in the liberal arts and in doing so prepares them for their life as a free person. Affiliate department: Classics.

In 1913, suffragists were taking to the streets demanding a constitutional amendment for the vote, while at the same time, the Labor movement turned to the strike to demand living wages and better conditions. Members of all these groups converged in Greenwich Village to debate their view with the artists and bohemians who were in the process of remaking them-selves into the new men and new women of the twentieth century. In the first half of this course, students familiarize themselves with the period and then participate in a role-playing simulation in which they must determine what social changes are most important as well as how one can or should realize these goals. In the second half of the course, students embark on a guided independent research project exploring an issue that arises from a study of this crucial period in American history.

By examining a varied selection of ecologically minded texts, this seminar explores how and why writers have argued for particular understandings of the concepts of wilderness and wild. Drawing on nature writing in several genres, the course further explores the social, political, and cultural issues at stake in these contested definitions. Among the questions the course considers: Is wilderness a useful conceptual category for current ecocrit-ical analysis, or is it fraught with excess ideological baggage? Is wild a more productive concept for a critical practice that might inform effective resistance to current environmental degradation? How do wild and wil-derness intersect with the familiar critical issues of race, gender, and co-lonial legacy? Affiliate department: English.

This course, however, explores the myriad ways that sport is enmeshed in the social world: the interplay of sports and sporting culture with socio-political conflict and ideology. Honing in on the three major sports of the Americas—baseball, soccer, and boxing—students examine the interaction of these sports with shifting historical and social contexts Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry16     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  in order to query the role of identity, economy, class, and politics both on and off the field.

For example, what do religion, anthropol-ogy, philosophy, medicine, psychology, and literature have to say about the seen and the unseen, the threshold between life and death—issues that shoot to the core of human existence and exert the strongest hold on the human spirit? Students explore the validity of claims about belief and unbelief, the world beyond the senses, made by prophets, priests, poets, shamans, scientists, philosophers. As both writers and speakers, students construct persuasive arguments based on an eval-uation of sources that either contradict or defend given assumptions about the role of liminality in culture, history, identity, and the natural world. Students begin with texts that insist upon controversial readings, such as Toni Morrison’s Beloved, Louis Owen’s Wolfsong, and Isabel Allende’s The House of the Spirits.

Specifically, and somewhat distinct from an investigation of jokes and laughter, readings and assignments in this course address the formal aspects of comedy, especially as defined by their origins in Greek fertility rites through to their absurdist postmod-ern manifestations, and beyond. Students read, discuss, and write about plays from four or five epochs, in light of theories of comedy put forth by thinkers like Plato Aristotle, Sigmund Freud, Bertrand Russell, Susan K.

The title of this seminar, “Architectures of Power,” suggests that there is some kind of mechanism, be it actual or theoretical, that structures power and one’s ability to act effectively. Focusing on the power dynamics that structure writing, cultural interactions, and individ-ual mindsets, this course is composed of a series of units that, building on one another, move students from the basic questions one asks of writing to more complex written assignments that require integration of a number of provided source materials.

In addition to reading about developing and structuring arguments, students view relevant media and read popular press and academic articles about the various issues relating to technology and communication. In the process of examining these controversies, students encounter the two central aspects of the humanistic tradition of rhetorical education: argumen-tation and effective oral and written expression.

The focus of the course is to en-gage in written analysis and critical conversations about contemporary art by examining the art of pivotal 20th and 21st century artists and art movements that have redefined our ideas about art and the creative process. Through lectures, discussions, readings, written assignments, group critiques, studio art projects, and attendance at professional art exhibitions the class will address the following questions: What is Art? What developments influenced shifts in artistic practices? In what way(s) do I understand a particular artist’s creative pursuit?

SSI 1 148   Journalism and Democracy   Journalism is sometimes called the “Fourth Estate,” a vision in which the press serves an essen-tial function akin to the checks and balances of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches within the American government. In such a vision, the press provides the unbiased information necessary for a citizenry to make informed decisions. But, of course, this idealized vision is compli-cated. Our country is a diverse country, encompassing a wide range of geographic, cultural, and ideological positions, and the work of journal-ism is no simple matter. Where (literally and figuratively) is journalism coming from? Who is developing the content? Through what medium is journalistic content being disseminated? Who is funding it? Where is the line between reporting news and creating news? What stories are being told and what stories are not being told? How do the answers to these questions affect the state of democracy?  In this course, students explore these and other questions through engaging in writing and speaking assignments that build on a variety of readings from different academic disciplines as well as from modern and historical journalism. Students discuss what the current state of journalism means for them as citizens, consumers, scholars, and—potentially—journalists. Affiliate department: English.

Why do they construct these texts and what are the effects of such narratives on how we understand medicine, patients, and medical professionals? Students examine these sources in order to discuss the implications of these narratives both at an individual and personal level, and more broadly in terms of the global, political, cultural, and social implications. Assigned readings come from a variety of authors, includ-ing academics, journalists, medical professionals, and patients, and may include a range of media types (original medical reports, popular news articles, autobiographical memoirs or plays, radio programs, TV shows, and film excerpts).

Art may serve as a lens or mirror for sensitive social issues, and act as a catalyst for change. But nowhere, perhaps, can one find artistic expressions of a culture as powerful and uncomfortable as in twentieth-century dance. From the modernist reinvention of ballet by Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes and Balanchine’s neoclassicism to the explosive experiments of mod-ern dance by Isadore Duncan, Mary Wigman, Merce Cunningham, Martha Graham, and Alvin Ailey, dance becomes a vehicle for social movements: a means of critiquing norms and values, and representing tacit anxieties about gender, race, sexuality, nation, and collectivity. Twentieth-century dance is made more transgressive by its medium: the body. The dancing body has been a site for controversy in academic discourse, as the vestiges of our Kantian mind-body dichotomy linger. By exploring embodiment and social activism in watershed music-dance collaborations of the twentieth Century, this course invites students to face the social issues of today and ask: what can the study of dance mean for us?

In seeking a vantage point from which one might glimpse these phenomena, this course follows a well-beaten anthropological path: beginning with a commonplace, everyday practice, students work outward in scope and backward in time, constructing an informed, analytic, and critical perspective on human society and culture through the seemingly pedestrian substance of food. The course is organized in two segments. In the first portion of the semester, students engage a set of readings intended to provide an introduction to the multiple research agendas that characterize the bur-geoning scholarship on food and eating. In the second segment of the course, students delineate a conversation in that scholarship that they wish to join, and deploy an independent research project of their own design that triangulates between existing scholarship and ethnographic data they collect.

In one way, this is the old and well-known “Bible story.” In another way, it is quite new and con-troversial given that, in recent years, remarkable discoveries in archae-ological sites and archives have given new insights into these ancient worlds, into the relationships between Israel and its neighbors, and into the relationships and differences among the Biblical writers themselves. The questions arise all over again: What is distinctive about the ideas of the Bible? How is the ancient to be defined as against the modern, and what can be learned from the ancient concepts of cosmology, of human society, and human destiny? Throughout, the course concentrates on the framing of arguments on the meaning and significance of Biblical Seminar in Scholarly InquiryUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     19ideas from a comparison of Biblical documents, one with another, and with documents from other cultures. One of the objectives of the course is to discover what the Bible is “saying” in those original con-texts.

As part of a generation of “digital natives,” university students and their peers are at times the objects of study, the evidence for various arguments, and the authority on digital technology. The goal for this course is for students to finish the semester with greater insight into the complexities of how technolo-gy shapes their lives.

SSI2 159  Evolution for All   Evolution is the process that allows one to make sense of the wondrous diversity of species, physiologies, be-haviors, and everything else biological around us. The course explores both historical and current work that uses an evolutionary lens to look at all kinds of biological questions and focuses on issues near and dear to humans, such as food, sex, violence, and religion. Following the exam-ination of a series of instructor-led case studies, students pursue their own independent research into the historical and/or current evolutionary analysis of a particular trait or characteristic.

Those uses of force may defend a country from conquest, defeat rapacious dictators, secure vital eco-nomic assets, or protect innocents from slaughter. Force may also be used to conquer, dominate, and annihilate. Since force is a tool that can be used for both good and ill, it is not surprising that there is significant debate about the conditions for its appropriate use. After examining two schools of thought addressing the ethical obligations of leaders, students embark upon an exploration of difficult cases designed to shed light on the consequential decisions that leaders of countries face. Was Truman justified in dropping the atomic bombs on Japan in 1945? Is it permissible to order a military intervention that violates a state’s sover-eignty to in order to protect people from ethnic cleansing? Is the use of drones to conduct targeted assassination an acceptable part of a count-er-terrorism strategy? These are just some of the questions this course poses. In examining these issues students complete extensive reading and writing assignments, learn to assess sources of information, devel-op their ability to read and think critically, and practice writing and speak-ing persuasively.

SSI2 160  Modernist Literature   In this course, students examine key authors in the Modernist movement. Focusing on the most important figures, such as Woolf, Eliot, Stein, H.D. and Hemingway, students trace the development of a style that pushed the boundaries of all of the arts as it attempted to understand a radically changing world. To frame this investigation, students become fluent in their ability to distinguish between the multiple movements within Modernism as a whole—Imagism, Cubism, Surrealism, the Harlem Renaissance, Bauhaus—and will even try their hand at some of these creative techniques. Students ponder their dreams with Freud, sing off-key with Stravinsky, turn the world into geometry with Picasso, and figure out why Frank Lloyd Wright could stick a house on top of a waterfall. While introducing students to this broad view of the period, however, the course asks, above all, that students deeply investigate the writers of this period. The course aims to ignite the imagination while demanding critical thinking and expert writing. Affiliate department: English.

Working from this assumption the course explores representations of colonial-ism, and empire across a history of Western feature film.  Although, the course focuses on a particular genre of films, the course aims to teach students the basic language of film more broadly through interpretation and close analysis of film as argument and public arguments about film. The course workshops student’s written work that culminates with the production of a video essay presenting a completed argument about a specific film.  Affiliate department: Communication Studies.

Might it do both? This course asks all these questions. It focuses on two central women in Islam and Christianity: Mary and ’Aisha, one of the Prophet Muhammad’s wives. Students will look at the existing sources about them and ask “how do we know and evaluate sources as historical sources?” Students then look at later interpretations of Mary and Aisha, both in Islam and Christianity. By looking at how these women have been represented, and reimagined, students better understand these two religious tradi-tions in their historical contexts. Then students look at how feminist thinkers in these traditions look to these two figures in order to re-imag-ine women into a patriarchal past and to re-think roles of women in the future.

However, society is becoming more aware that a person’s genitalia does not al-ways coincide with their gender identity. Moreover, even for individuals who identify within the gender binary (i.e., woman/girl or man/boy), the expression of gender and adherence to gender role ideologies varies greatly. This course is the first semester of the Seminars in Scholarly Inquiry (SSI) core requirement and is designed to examine the various theoretical perspectives on gender identity, expectations, and expres-sion, with a particular emphasis on transgender and genderqueer identi-ties. Students review relevant media, popular press, personal narratives, Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry20     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  and academic articles about the various framings of, and issues relating to, gender.

This course treats a wide variety of materials from the ancient world to the present, including lyric poetry, novels, memoirs, visual art, and film—but the primary focus is on WWI and the lead-up to WWII. Students explore the ways in which various rhetorical and nar-rative treatments of soldiers and of war offer us understandings of the subjective experiences and ethical choice of ordinary and extraordinary people under extreme stress and facing horrendous challenges. The course also intends to consider notions of the individual, the community, and civilization (with all that word implies) against the backdrop of the chaotic action of war and combat.

A growing paradigm shift in science places diverse associations between organisms as central to evolutionary theory and life on Earth: not so much competition among organisms, but complex “networking” be-tween them. The course examines relationships between organisms through this lens, including examples such as crustaceans that replace the tongues of fish, the tiny “wildlife” that lives on and within human beings, and the fact that life as known on Earth has resulted from ancient symbioses. Students develop skills in evaluating, discussing, and presenting concepts relating to symbiosis and parasitism, from historical, philosophical, and scientific viewpoints.

This course addresses common misunderstandings about ethics and frequent difficulties in the application, use, and explanation of ethical standards. Students learn to understand and define what ethics is and is not; develop an Applied Ethics analytical structure generating defensible outcomes; and critically evaluate the sources, information, and assumptions used to examine, challenge, and support ethical con-clusions. This seminar is not discipline specific. Subject matter varies and encompasses issues of reproductive freedom, bodily integrity, employment and business practices, and law interpretation and enforce-ment, among others.

Ethnographies are the product of this academic endeavor--the holistic texts anthropologists produce about these different ways of being in the world. This course explores ethnog-raphies of societies outside the western ambit, and from a period just prior to the welter of global interconnection. These ethnographies yield some perspective on the diverse ways of being in this world. Anchoring the discussion of these indigenous societies is an assessment of gen-der relations, ethnic interrelations, hierarchy, power, and social organiza-tion. How are those social features configured in the variety of diverse,  indigenous social worlds we consider? After perusing ethnographies from around the world, the semester concludes with a substantial term paper that requires students to reflect on American society in light of their newfound understandings of the diversity of indigenous societies.

The first part of the course is devoted to close examination of the Russian Revolution, a defining event of the twentieth century. In this section of the course, students examine the Tsarist old regime, the revolutionary movements that challenged it, the dramatic events of the 1917 revolutions, and the Civil War and new revolutionary order that followed. This historical work provides opportunities for selecting and evaluating sources, formulating questions, and presenting work in written and spoken form. The course then focuses on the different stages of undertaking an independent research project, including posing a research question, selecting sourc-es, compiling research materials, drafting, revising, and executing a re-search presentation.

This course studies Zen in its Asian contexts, examining the emergence of Chan/Zen within Buddhist history, the interplay between Zen, aesthetics, and philosophy, and the relation between Zen and such developments as nationalism and social dis-crimination. The course aims to avoid a romantic study of Zen and to develop instead a balanced understanding, exploring the insights as well as oversights that have appeared within the Zen tradition. As the second course in the first year seminar series, a major part of this course is geared towards developing academic independence by guiding students through the process of writing a major research paper in which they advance an academic argument related to some aspect of Buddhism.

In what ways are these plays shaped by their historical moment, or even the materials of their production? Conversely, how might the plays have shaped the political, literary, and theatrical conditions of the period? This course begins with the analysis of a selection of plays Shakespeare produced in 1599, by all accounts a remarkable year in the life of the dramatist and in Elizabethan England. From there, students turn to a play and year of their own choosing, the analysis of which forms the basis of an independent project. Strategies for research and critical thinking are developed through the study of both dramatic and non-dramatic texts, and in situating work among competing theories of literary historicism.

The body is at once universal and yet radically subjective; everyone has a body, but not all bodies are the same or similar. Moreover, knowledge about the body varies dramatically be-tween different groups of people. This course focuses on discourse about the body: who has authority to speak about the body? Why and for what reasons? What kinds of language do people employ when they write or speak about the body? How does their language use change depending on the audience? Students begin thinking about these questions by read-ing several texts about legislation debates concerning the body. A human body forms the single most basic legal entity in our society, and also per-haps the most contested. Who has power over an individual? What are the limits of that power, and how are such limitations determined? These discussions are followed by reading several accounts by doctors: people who spend their lives examining and interacting with many kinds of bod-ies in different situations. How do doctors understand their relationship to the kinds of bodies they see? Finally, students consider how people conceptualize their own relationship to their bodies.

Despite the accolades and shower of awards for the artistic achievement that is “Hamilton”, it is worth asking -- how much of this is accurate history, political analysis, and econom-ics? Using the music and the musical as our guide, students in this course will read, dissect, critique, and compare written, visual, and aural works in order to understand the foundations of U.S. political economy. Through close reading and evaluation of primary sources and secondary analysis students will learn about Alexander Hamilton’s role in creating the foundational systems of our economy and government.

Logically, this perspective can lead to attitudes, policies, and actions that aim to annihilate the difference between “us” (the in-group) and “them” (the dangerous outsiders)—either by forced assimilation or even by genocide. This course examines the ways that prejudice has been a part of such murderous and inhumane activity, beginning with a sustained exploration of the role of anti-Semitic prejudice in pogroms that took almost immediately after the Holocaust. Following the first section of the course, students will be guided to examine other situa-tions of prejudicial, even murderous thinking and actions against Native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, and Arab and Muslim Americans. Students will choose one of these five groups as the subject of further, more independent scholarly explo-ration, while concluding the course with a consideration of yet another kind of “othering”: the practice, in some US locales, of local govern-ments enacting legislation to exclude certain types of people from cer-tain neighborhoods.

While the term he coined, utopia, literally means no-place, his fictional text served as a powerful indictment of English society. Among other things, he argued for a radical rethinking of education, a reduction in territorial expansion, and an oddly progressive approach to gender relations and marriage. While More coined the term, the notion of utopia as a societal critique stretches back to foundational texts such as Plato’s Republic and Genesis. In fact, it is hard to conceive of the progress of Western thought without the presence of utopian thinking. This course explores utopian thought, examining utopian theories of the golden age, econom-ics, religion, architecture, gender relations, technology, etc. Students are asked to use this frame to examine and critique today’s society. This is a writing-intensive course which uses the theme of utopia to teach critical thinking and scholarly writing. Affiliate department: English.

Benjamin Franklin wrote one of the first American autobiographies, a life story and at the same time a blueprint for Franklin’s vision of a new kind of person: an American. Frederick Douglass’s devastating first-person slave narrative worked to establish the humanity of African-Americans and attacked the system of chattel slavery. Maxine Hong Kingston’s experimental memoir told of another new kind of American, the urban immigrant. These masters of the genre used their personal stories for varied rhetorical aims. In the process, each helped create a distinctively American literary genre: biography of self-as-nation, slave narrative, and immigrant story. Over the course of this seminar, students read American autobiographies, addressing a set of linked questions: What is autobiography? Why have Americans chosen to write it? How have its rhetorical functions in American life altered over time? What does it mean to be an American, and how are American autobiographies shapers of and shaped by this notion? The varied conclusions students reach will help them achieve a clearer understanding of both the uses of literature and the complexities of American identity. Affiliate department: English.

While the question might seem at first tied to the recent political and legal battles over same-sex mar-riage, this course explores a number of important ways this question has been at the heart of social and political change across a wide swath of Anglo-American history and examines how tension and conflict in-herent in that change show up in literature. Students first encounter this question in the plays of William Shakespeare and John Webster, and in John Milton’s impassioned plea for the right to divorce. The inquiry of the course is shaped by Stephanie Coontz’s sweeping historical text Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage. Students examine the brief period of post-WWII America where “traditional” marriage can be understood as having been the norm, at least for some classes. Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry22     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Equipped with a better grasp of the history of marriage, at the end of the semester students turn their attention to the way extending mar-riage to same-sex couples does or doesn’t raise the question: what is marriage for?

Students will be introduced to a number of arguments about the nature and consequences of some of the changes digital technology is fostering; however, each student is asked to pose his or her own scholarly question within this broad field of inquiry. These questions, and the research they inspire and require, will shape the true content of the course. Students leave this course with new and important information about the potential futures made possible by digital technology.

His songs, including “Fascinating Rhythm” and “They Can’t Take That Away from Me,” are favorites of singers, jazz musicians, and casual whistlers alike. He strad-dled the divide between classical and popular music like no one before him. He also blazed a trail as the first American composer who could be called a celebrity: his rags-to-riches story, friendships with movie stars, glamorous bachelor lifestyle, and shocking death from a brain tumor before age 40 have all contributed to a fascination with Gershwin that goes well beyond rhythm. In this first-year seminar, students explore Gershwin from various angles: as a celebrity, a songwriter, and a target of criticism. By finding and looking at primary and secondary sources, listening closely to music, and considering the social and cultural con-texts in which Gershwin lived (and in which his music and memory live on), students will gain insights about music, history, biography, and culture, while also continuing to develop as researchers, communica-tors, and critical thinkers.

Because the surviving sources privilege the elite, this course focuses on women of the upper classes, with particular attention to empresses. The course examines the infamous Theodora (6th c.) who rose to imperial rank from the slums of Constantinople, as well as Irene and Theodora (8-9th c.) who affected a lasting change in the religious policy of the empire, and the curious sisters, Zoe and Theodora, who even reigned by themselves briefly in 1042. To shed light on the role of women of the lower classes, the course also explores marital and home life, women’s work, child-bearing, women’s attitudes toward icons, and the importance of the cult of the Virgin Mary. The course provides students an opportunity to engage with the process of scholarly inquiry by completing extensive reading and writing assignments.

Over a hun-dred years old, these documents form a mosaic of images and texts that tell an extraordinary story of privilege, courage, tragedy and loss. They include field diaries, letters, passports, birth, death, marriage certificates, news articles, as well as many pictures. The story of their provenance begins and ends with a mystery: how did these documents travel from St. Petersburg, Russia, to Spokane, Washington, finally be found in a cardboard box in a storage unit north of Seattle? What stories does this journey tell?  Students discover facts and put them together in an order that yields the deepest and most logical thesis. Where there are missing facts, students discover ways to use secondary sources to fill in the contexts. Where there are blank spaces, students collaborate on ways to imagine linkages that suggest the deepest and most mean-ingful interpretations. In other words, out of these recovered facts, stu-dents create a life story set against a backdrop of one of the most aston-ishing periods in modern history. Affiliate department: English.

The course begins by addressing the social structure of pre-revolutionary France and the events and ideas that led to its upheaval. Significant time is spent analyzing the details of the revolutionary years and the formation of a new government. The course closes with a study of the period from the Terror to the rise of Napoleon.

This course examines how queer critiques of marriage equality can help students understand the institution of marriage more fully, especially in terms of what personal and social benefits marriage is intended to confer. By mid-semester, students develop a research question addressing the evolution of mar-riage as an institution and/or legal and social progress toward LGBTQ rights in the US.

Rather than focusing on autobiogra-phy as a genre, students use these primary sources in conjunction with supplementary secondary source materials to reconstruct the cultural and political setting of each writer’s life.  In the first part of the semes-ter, students practice the historian’s craft of close, contextualized analy-sis of evidence.

Often individu-als accept these arguments as facts, truth(s), and reality. In this course, students explore the rhetorical techniques (persuasive communication) of such messages and understand that they can resist, challenge, and question them. In particular, this course explores persuasion and controversial topics related to the American Dream. The mythos of the American Dream permeates daily life in the United States; this course centers on discussion topics that include the ways that the American Dream influences politics, education and workplaces, understandings of families and relationships, and even individuals’ desires and goals. In addition to reading about developing and structuring arguments, stu-dents view relevant media and read popular press and academic articles about the various framings of, and issues relating to, communication and the American Dream. While critically examining these controver-sies, students encounter two central aspects of the humanistic tradition of rhetorical education: argumentation and effective oral and written expression.

This era saw radical revisions in government, religion, society, and the arts, as English men and women lived through the birth of Protestantism and capitalism, embraced print culture, experienced new forms of state control and nationalistic fervor, and learned to see themselves in global terms as they founded colonies and trading posts halfway around the world. At the center of these changes were the five Tudor monarchs themselves, all of whom have been the subject of much debate among historians. This course introduces students to the raw materials of Tudor history and culture, giving them practice evaluating different types of primary sources with an eye toward issues of authorship, bias, and au-dience. The course also invites students to identify and critically assess conflicting claims made in secondary sources, including both modern works of scholarship and popular interpretations, and gives them ana-lytical tools needed to enter into these ongoing conversations.

Case studies focus on plays that stage a collision of cultures between groups of people who speak different languages and novels that feature translators as central char-acters. The course culminates with the investigation of movement of a single story or character across genres: from short story, to stage play, to film, for instance.

In reality, history is complex, contested, and incomplete.  Historical evidence is frequently missing, contradictory, or open to multiple interpretations.  Historians’ devel-opment of arguments and narratives involves as much art as science. This course uses a series of case studies—involving everything from circulating chapatis to baby-stealing dingos—to examine how historical knowledge is produced and how historians grapple with the problem of uncertainty. How much can be truly known about the past? Is it “an-other country”? How certain do historians need to be in order to make responsible arguments? Are there pieces of the past that are simply lost forever? Are historians at the mercy of “who lives, who dies, who tells the story”? Students address all of these questions as they consider how to write and speak clearly and coherently about a past that is rarely clear or coherent. Affiliate department: History.

Mega-celebrity is a phenomenon cutting across all the performing arts. However, rock superstardom has been a particularly difficult status to manage, perhaps because rock artists play pivotal roles in youth culture and are often perceived as mirroring Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry24     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  broader societal changes. We examine how artists interact with the media forces through which they work. How do artists manage their image? Can this image be hijacked, and, if so, by whom and to what end? Can this image be reclaimed? In addition, we engage these artists as musicians and evaluate their impact on the development of rock music from the mid 1950s to the present day.

The course begins by examining the socio-political and intellectual climate of the Naturalist period, especially the influence of Darwin, Marx, and others on beliefs about progress, social responsibility, human motivation, and the pur-poses of literature and art. Students then read fiction and drama by several important practitioners of Naturalism, as well as contemporary reviewers’ responses to their works and short critical writings in which the writers themselves explain what they are doing and why. Included in this group are the dramatist August Strindberg and fiction writers Emile Zola, Stephen Crane, Jack London, Frank Norris, Edith Wharton, and Theodore Dreiser. Students also study Jacob Riis’ photojournalism, which focused, like many of the early Naturalist novels, on the plight of the urban poor. Affiliate program: Humanities. Satisfies the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 1 core requirement.SSI2 194  Castles   Castles are one of the most recognizable symbols of the medieval past, evoking visions of both romance and violence.  In Western Europe between the ninth and fifteenth centuries, castles served as status symbols and reminders of political and economic hier-archies, as focal points for military conflict, and as domestic and courtly settings.  This course introduces students to the castle phenomenon, using recent work by historians and archaeologists that has considerably enhanced our understanding of the origins, physical construction, and functions of castles.  Students become familiar with a range of medie-val evidence, such as extant castles and ruins, medieval literature, and chronicles, and study castles from the perspectives of several disci-plines, including history, archaeology, and literary studies, asking how we know what we think we know about castles.  In the second half of the semester students research and write a substantial term paper with a complementary digital component. Affiliate: History. Satisfies the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 2 core requirement.SSI1 195  Honors: The Scientific and Romantic Revolutions   This course explores the causes and consequences of two decisive turning points in Western civilization—the Scientific Revolution of the 16th and 17th Centuries, and the Romantic movement of the late 18th and early 19th Centuries. The course aims to understand these periods of upheaval in their political, religious, economic, scientific, and aesthetic dimensions, and traces their legacies in contemporary Western cultures. Affiliate department: Honors. Satisfies the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 1 core requirement.SSI2 196  Honors: Postmodernism and the Challenge of Belief   This course studies the philosophical, historical, and aesthetic underpin-nings of the late twentieth-century zeitgeist known as postmodernism, the assumptions of which continue to govern much of how we think today, especially in the academy. While many of the ideas central to postmodernism are many centuries old, their significance with respect to matters of belief (whether ethical, epistemological, or religious) has never before been so fully realized. The nature of subjectivity, truth, reality, morality, and knowledge itself have all been radically ‘problema-tized’. Without recourse to claims of truth, or moral systems, how do we distinguish right from wrong?  How do we adjudicate conflicts in a world in which all values are equally contingent? How do we convince others of the validity of our positions, and is it even ethical to do so? The course explores the origins of postmodernism; the social, moral, and philosophical consequences of its core assumptions; its benefits and limitations in addressing real world concerns; and how it is itself a system of belief with a worldview no less totalizing and morally rigorous than the religious and Enlightenment precursors it sought to displace. Affiliate department: Honors. Satisfies the Seminar in Scholarly Inquiry 2 core requirement.Connections PurposeThe purpose of this core area is for students to develop an understand-ing of the interrelationship of fields of knowledge. The Connections core course is normally taken after completion of all other university core requirements, in the junior or senior year, and must be taken at Puget Sound.  Science and Politics   There is a long tradition of seeing science as apolitical but historically a complex relationship has existed between science and politics. Scientists work within political structures, and those systems in turn influence what kinds of science are pursued within a given society. Science has also come with norms that make claims about what kind of political systems support the best kind of science. This course draws on historical, sociological, and philosophical studies of science, primary source material from scientists, politicians, and others, as well as literature, film, and cartoons. Students examine issues such as these: the types of science that get done within dem-ocratic and totalitarian systems; in communist, socialist, and capitalist societies; how and why science has been harnessed in fights over po-litical authority; and how political decisions direct the scientists’ careers and the trajectory of scientific disciplines.

Our staff provides resources and support for all students interested in exploring identity-based issues. In particular, we support the individual and com-munity needs of students of color; LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and non-binary, queer or questioning) students; women; first generation college students; and students of various spiritual backgrounds, abilities, and documentation statuses. The office oversees the Student Diversity Center and Social Justice Center, which provide open and warm com-munity space for students to gather with friends and organizations; seek solidarity; engage in intercultural dialogue; and implement/attend pro-grams related to identities, communities, and cultures.Spiritual Life and Civic EngagementThe Office of Spiritual Life and Civic Engagement is responsible for supporting and developing programs and resources for a broad range of students and groups related to religious life, spiritual diversity, so-cial justice, civic engagement, and community service. The University Chaplain is available to students of all religious or spiritual backgrounds, including those who identify as non-religious, agnostic, or atheist, for support, reflection, and program development. Student-led religious life clubs provide connection and activities for students from specific spiritu-al backgrounds, and students are always welcome to form new groups that meet their needs. Student Interfaith Coordinators help develop and implement programs and give student leaders a chance to develop skills in interreligious leadership. Significant scholarship and leadership oppor-tunities are available for returning students of all religious backgrounds.The Office of Spiritual Life and Civic Engagement is a central point for the campus community to connect with off-campus organizations for service and engagement projects. Students can mentor and tutor local youth, volunteer for a campus “food salvage” program that supports a local transitional housing program, and participate in a program that collects thousands of items of clothing and furnishings for donation to Tacoma-area service organizations. We also actively support voter en-gagement and host speakers that encourage active citizenship.The Office of Spiritual Life and Civic Engagement also works with a wide range of student groups and campus initiatives that support interest in and exploration of social justice, inclusion, and diversity. The office facilitates an Alternative Break program, which offers students the chance to spend part of fall and spring breaks immersed in Tacoma doing community service, meeting with local activists and leaders, and reflecting on the intersection of social disparities with their own values and identities.  We also partner closely with the Office of Intercultural Engagement to engage issues of difference and inclusion on campus.Counseling, Health, and Wellness Services (CHWS)CHWS provides confidential multidisciplinary care in support of student physical and mental health. Counseling Services: Our providers help students address anxiety, de-pression, substance abuse, eating disorders, issues related to sexuality and relationships, adjustment to college, trauma, and other concerns. No appointment is needed to initiate counseling. Simply drop by CHWS for an initial screening week day afternoons between 1–4 p.m. Based on that contact, students and providers collaborate to determine best treatment options which might include short-term counseling in CHWS (group or individual treatments) or referral to off-campus providers for longer-term, specialized, or more intensive treatment needs. Medical Services: CHWS provides confidential medical evaluation and treatment for primary health care needs. CHWS is not equipped to provide emergency room care, so students with urgent treatment needs should go directly to a location hospital. We emphasize self-care, health promotion, and disease prevention. Providers work to get students back to academic rigors as soon as possible, coaching stu-dents to become their own self-advocates with their healthcare needs. Appointments can be scheduled online, in person, or over the phone. Students are charged $25-55 per visit depending on the complexity of their visit. Additional charges may be added for medications, vaccines, medical supplies, or lab tests, which CHWS typically bills at below-mar-ket rates. CHWS staff refer students to off-campus specialty care, X-rays, or other necessary services. Students are expected to arrive on campus with adequate health insurance supporting local area treatment.New Student OrientationPuget Sound’s new student orientation program works to make the tran-sition to college and the university community smooth, easy, and fun. Students have the opportunity to interact with faculty, staff, and class-mates while exploring the Northwest.BRAVeBystander Revolution Against Violence (BRAVe) creates and facilitates programming for the campus community to address issues of sexual and gender based violence including sexual assault, dating and domes-tic violence and stalking. Education around healthy relationships, con-sent and survivor support are also part of the portfolio of programming included for students.Off-Campus Student Services (OCSS)OCSS has a website with tips and resources to assist students living off campus. Topics on the website include Rights and Responsibilities, Conflict Resolution, Safety, Searching for Housing, Negotiating Your Lease, and how to make the transition to off-campus living. Residence LifeThe University of Puget Sound, as a residential liberal arts college, affirms the educational benefits inherent in this kind of undergraduate experience. Student learning, in and out of the classroom, and student success are enhanced by the on-campus residential experience. Being a part of a com-munity of scholars is also reinforced by living in campus housing. Because of this, Puget Sound requires all students to live on-campus for their first two academic years with the university and significant numbers of students choose to continue living on campus through graduation to fully reap the benefits of a residential liberal arts experience.Residence Life seeks to ensure that the academic mission of the university is sustained by students’ living arrangements on campus. The department strives to create a sense of community within each of the residential facilities. Through educational and social programs and other resources, the department aids residents in the development of those qualities that are essential to academic achievement, personal growth, and successful group living. Living spaces on campus include Residence Halls (eleven Tudor-Gothic residence halls are arranged in two spacious quadrangles on the north and south ends of campus) and Union Avenue Residences (residences on Union Avenue that house eight of the university’s national fraternities and sororities—Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi Delta Theta, Beta Theta Pi, Sigma Chi, Alpha Phi, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Pi Beta Phi; Delta Delta Delta members reside in campus houses; first-year students are not allowed to live in the chapter houses). Students residing in these build-ings are required to purchase a meal plan. Residence Houses (these Division of Student Affairs210     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  48 houses vary in size) are reserved for continuing students, and include some theme housing. Students residing in residence houses have the option of purchasing a meal plan.The university offers several special residential programs including Theme Floors and Halls (e.g., healthy living/substance free, and outdoor programs/adventure education). In addition, first-year students may be enrolled in a fall seminar whose participants live together on the same floor of a residence hall. These seminars are referred to as residential seminars. Also, there are Theme Houses that create strong links be-tween living and learning experiences by involving students who have similar interests and who develop a living environment that is conducive to intellectual inquiry beyond the classroom. The special program hous-es include the Honors/Langlow House for upper-division students in the Honors program, language and music houses, and a number of houses whose themes range from academics to community service. Campus houses are reserved for students at the sophomore level and higher. First-year students who are interested in joining a fraternity or sorority participate in formal recruitment at the start of spring semester and may move into the chapter’s facility at the beginning of their sophomore year. Transfer students with sophomore standing or above may participate in fall informal recruitment and move into the chapter’s housing facility immediately, provided space is available. Each living unit is staffed by undergraduate students, or resident assistants (RAs), who serve as peer counselors, hall administrators, and facilitators for the residents of their living area. The student leader team also initiates, organizes, and implements educational and develop-mental programs that contribute to the academic and personal growth of residents. The leader team enforces the Student Integrity Code and other university policies.  Resident Community Coordinators (RCCs) are student leader teams working in the continuing student areas (on-cam-pus houses, Oppenheimer Hall, Smith Hall, Thomas Hall, and Trimble Hall). Resident Directors (RDs) are full-time, master’s-level university staff members who live in apartments in the residence halls. The RDs coordinate daily life in the residence halls and supervise Residence Life Student Leadership Teams and programming.The Student Integrity Code as well as federal, state, and local laws govern students in all residence units. Failure to comply with the gov-erning laws and codes may be considered grounds for termination of residence. Students are encouraged to be self-regulating and to adopt their own system of government within each facility, consistent with university policies. Each residential unit has a student government that engages in community issues and assists in policy decisions.Residence Life Application ProcessTo be eligible for a room assignment, students must be enrolled in classes for the following semester. An application form for admitted students can be found on myPugetSound. Continuing students sign up for on-campus housing via the Housing Selection process in the spring semester.Upon a room assignment, the housing contract and all terms and con-ditions set forth are binding for the entire academic year. This contract applies to all student residents of university-owned facilities. Appeals to be released from the residential requirement or cancel a housing contract must be submitted to the Residence Life office via the On-Campus Housing Contract Appeal form available at pugetsound.edu/reslifepolicies.Confirmation of room assignments and roommate information for fall enrollment is posted to myPugetSound and placement letters are mailed to admitted students during the month of June. RatesRoom and board costs are charged as a unit, and all students living in residence halls (including Thomas Hall and Trimble Hall) or the Union Avenue facilities must pay board as well as room charges. Residents of on-campus houses are charged room costs only and have the option of purchasing a meal plan. Room and board rates are subject to change. University housing rates are detailed in the “Student Financial Services” section of this Bulletin.Housing for Continuing StudentsEach fall and spring semester, a housing selection process is held for continuing students.  In the spring semester, all current students are invited to participate in the on-line Housing Selection process. An email detailing the various options and process is sent in December. For more information, contact Residence Life, 253.879.3317, Campus Mailbox 1003. Information and policies about contracts, terms and conditions, and appeals listed above are applicable for all enrolled students.Student ActivitiesStudent Activities enhances the living-learning environment, encourages student participation in Puget Sound traditions, and provides resources and leadership opportunities that empower students to build a founda-tion for their future. Student Activities encompasses Greek life and lead-ership, outdoor programs, and student-led cultural and social programs. The myriad programs are inclusive of all students and members of the Puget Sound community. At the beginning of the spring semester, students may consider joining one of the campus fraternities or sororities.  Greek living is a res-idential option that attracts over a third of the student body and provides a supportive environment for its members. The Greek community at the University of Puget is founded upon the “Four Pillars” of Leadership, Scholarship, Service, and Tradition. These pillars represent the commit-ment from each fraternity and sorority to the values of our community. With a rich and storied tradition dating back more than 80 years, thou-sands of alumni have proudly and fondly looked back on their years as a member of the Greek community as a key part of their Puget Sound experience. Over the years, fraternities and sororities have played a ma-jor role in shaping student life at Puget Sound.Puget Sound Outdoors facilitates student-led programs to explore the breathtaking Pacific Northwest and enhance the educational experience. The program provides weekend outdoor trips, presentations, equipment rental, a bike shop, and outdoor and leadership skills development, and leadership opportunities. Wheelock Student CenterWheelock Student Center (WSC) is the hub of campus life. Each day of the week, WSC is busy with activities ranging from afternoon concerts to espresso breaks, from club and organization meetings to poetry read-ings. WSC is home to the Bookstore, dining hall, Diversions Café, The Cellar, Information Center, and Mail Services. The Information Center, located on the main level of the WSC, provides connections for new students and campus visitors as well as selling tickets to a variety of campus performances and lectures.Division of Student AffairsUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     211STUDENT FINANCIAL SERVICES Associate Vice President for Student Financial Services: Maggie MittuchAssociate Director for Financial Aid: Bryan GouldAssociate Director for Student Accounts: Cree BradfordAt Puget Sound, we believe that developing a strong foundation of financial literacy is an important part of a student’s education.

Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.304  Capital and Captivity   Capital and Captivity is an upper-level introduction to the study of Capital and its modern development, espe-cially as it relates to race and class. The seminar examines philosophical concepts central to Marx’s theories of capital and capitalism regarding issues of human potential for freedom and happiness. Central ideas to be discussed are alienation, slavery, race, class, labor, surplus value, machines, money, debt, capitalist accumulation, and communism. This seminar includes a substantive Marxist critique of modes of control and domination in contemporary society, including a critique of incarceration and race. Cross-listed with . Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 270  Religion, Social Movements and (in)Justice in the United States How do collective groups of people resist, challenge and rad-ically change the status quo?  What is a social movement, and what role does religious belief, practice and identity play in social and political change?  This class focuses on how religion intersects with questions of power, resistance, and identity in American social movements.  Polls tell us America is, by far, the most religious of the industrial democra-cies, and our often contentious politics reflect that: the debates over women’s reproductive rights,  the 1980s rise of the Christian Right, and our still-heated clashes over “moral values” are only its more obvious manifestations. Similar claims have suffused American history: the abolition, suffrage, and temperance movements all had deeply religious dimensions; the Progressive Era was powerfully shaped by the Social Gospel movement; many in the civil rights and anti-war efforts of the 1960s drew on deeply-held religious imperatives to challenge existing structures of power and enact social change.  This course exam-ines how religion has been central to historical and contemporary social movements like Immigrant rights, Black Lives Matter and Occupy. Offered occasionally.292 Basics of Bioethics This course is an examination of Western phil-osophical and religious understandings of moral issues brought on by advances in health care, science and technology. In this course, students will learn the “Principles approach” to bioethics, as well as other ethical approaches to the difficult moral issues raised by contemporary medical Religious StudiesUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     185science and its clinical applications. To that end, case analysis will be used extensively in this course. The course is designed to help facilitate connections for students between medical/scientific advances, ethics, religious values, and American public policy about technology and health care. Each class session will alternate between theoretical and medical/scientific considerations, and the concreteness of bioethical case anal-yses. Students who have credit for SSI1/SSI2 150 and are considering this course should consult with the instructor. Cross-listed as "

Through analysis of Disney animated films, Disney cor-porate reach and marketing, and Disney theme parks (“Where dreams come true”) students engage questions highlighted by Henry Giroux about Disney, “such as what role [Disney] plays in (1) shaping public memory, national identity, gender roles, and childhood values; (2) sug-gesting who and what qualifies as an agent; and (3) determining the role of consumerism in American Culture and around the globe” (The Mouse that Roared, p. 10, 2010). The course draws heavily on literature and theory from rhetorical criticism, media criticism, and cultural studies to engage the textual productions of Disney, Disney’s historical location in U.S. culture, Disney’s corporate structure and self-presentation, and its experiential vacation through theme parks, resorts, and vacation clubs. Disney broadly, and its theme parks specifically, offers highly orchestrat-ed and managed immersive entertainment spaces. A clearer understand-ing of Disney cultural reach allows the course to enter discussions about citizenship, identity production including race, gender, ethnicity, and nationalism, labor and capital flow, ideology and interpellation, cultural appropriation and homogenization, consumerism and commodification, hyperreality, narrative, and resistance.

It provides students the opportu-nity to connect their coursework with the Race and Pedagogy Institute. One of the tenets of African American studies is the production of scholarship and public programs that effects change and impacts lives especially for communities historically underserved by official state and national institutions (i.e., public scholarship; some prefer the term civic engagement). The Race and Pedagogy Institute articulates these tenets in its various initiatives. The African American Studies program builds on the synergy evolving between the Institute’s various activities including its Community Partners Forum, and debates and events in the larger community to provide students with unique opportunities for dynamic engagement with social and cultural challenges. This course provides students with the necessary educational scaffolding for the production of public scholarship and then offers them the opportunity to contribute their work as part of ongoing critical efforts to confront and transform historical disparities in power, and privilege between different com-munities especially among local, regional, and national communities.

It asks what affinities exist between the two, and what the impli-cations of such affinities might be for engendering a sense of both place and engagement in environmental context. The course explores these inter-sections both philosophically and experientially, engaging with local nature and Buddhist practice, to deepen the possibilities of understand-ing shared ground between the two.

Their combined effect undermined long-en-trenched institutions of religious and political authority to open space for new socio-political orders and cultural models. Art produced in the Italian city-states during this tumultuous period (roughly from 1490 to 1690), whether expressed in the form of architecture, rhetorical literature, plays, or painting, became a key means of reflecting and propagating public opinion—and a powerful weapon, both for wielding authority and for chal-lenging it. Offered occasionally.340 Film Genres   This course explores some of the major theoretical and cinematic approaches to film genre, and provides the opportunity for students to produce a short film project based upon this explora-tion. The specific genre (e.g., documentary, horror, melodrama, film noir, etc.) under study for any given semester is at the discretion of the professor. Through the analysis and subsequent production of the se-lected film genre, students interrogate the ways that industrial, social, technological, and aesthetic factors shape the development, circulation, and reception of a film genre over time. In addition to regular class time, evening film screenings are required. Counts toward the “Visual Culture” pathway; crosslisted as ENGL/"

Offered each year.340 Feminist and Queer Methodologies  This course provides stu-dents with an overview of feminist and queer methodological issues and dilemmas and a variety of research techniques and methods. We will investigate the ethics and politics of research; how theories are incorporated into research; how evidence is gathered; and what counts as truth and authority at higher levels of abstraction.  We will read col-laborative research by women organizing around health issues in India and education in prison, an ethnography of transgender identity, a study of women living with HIV, the graphic novel Fun Home, and scientific studies of lesbian sexuality. Students will come to understand how re-search methods direct research outcomes. The course will emphasize feminist and queer research as a deeply interdisciplinary endeavor, one that necessitates an appreciation for a variety of research approaches so that students develop the capacity to produce (and to learn from), in the words of Donna Haraway “both vertical deep studies and lateral, cross-connecting ones”.360 Gender, Feminist and/or Queer Theories This course surveys the history and development of feminist, gender and/or queer theories, with an emphasis on theories produced in the 20th and early 21st cen-turies. The course familiarizes students with key feminist, gender and queer theoretical debates and concepts, and requires them to read, think, speak, and write critically about these theories. Students are en-couraged to employ these feminist and queer theories and concepts in critical analyses of contemporary institutions and practices, as well as in their own lives. Topics examined include power, privilege, domination, identity, difference, intersectionality, post/colonialism, trans/nationalism, ability/disability, race, discourse, performativity, gender, femininity, mas-culinity, sexuality, asexuality, and/or embodiment. Offered each year.365  Indigenous Feminisms  This course is an inquiry into the relevance of Western Feminism and to the pressing new challenges of feminist 110     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Gender and Queer Studies Program/Geologytheorizing and practices.

Students in this and all contemporary world theatre courses engage with and collaborate in a set of informed, imaginative explorations of plays with a particular emphasis on dramatic action. They work toward the completion of this goal (1) by investigating, in light of performance, a play’s dramaturgy both from within (formally) and from without (historically, culturally); (2) by cutting, arranging, and producing scenes from plays they are studying; (3) by discovering formal and thematic threads that run through the plays, readings, and topics of this class; (4) by considering ways to increase the breadth and depth of theatre productions at Puget Sound through course work grounded in the Knowledge, Identity, and Power rubric. Although contemporary world theatre classes have similar learning outcomes and a common methodology, the plays and fields of study (e.g., African Diaspora, Asian Theatres, Voices of the Americas) differ from one class to another. Taught in rotation with , 252, and 256.256 Contemporary World Theatre  Through the lens of tradition and innovation, students explore the dramaturgy of contemporary world theatre from the 1960s to the present with an emphasis on plays from North America and the United Kingdom.

The course then moves to physical approaches to character based in clown traditions as a bridge toward absurdism. Over the semester students explore both physical and emotional approaches to developing characters and apply them to a range of dramatic styles in both lab and class work. Participation includes extensive scene work and rigorous physical and vocal activity. Prerequisite: THTR  215. Students must also register for the 300 lab. Offered frequently.310  The Actor and the Classic Repertoire   In this advanced acting course, students must engage in rigorous text analysis, rehearsal, and performance of a variety of classical texts including the Greeks, French UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     201Theatre Artscomedies, and Shakespeare. In the weekly lab, students train in Lecoq-based movement exercises, commedia mask work, voice, and stage combat. In doing so, students practice integration of language with the body and breath with thought. By acquiring skills in scansion, rhetoric, period movement, and vocal release, students develop tools for mak-ing engaging and honest acting choices with rich texts. Participation includes extensive scene work and rigorous physical and vocal activity. Prerequisite: , 252, 254 or 256.485  Topics in Theatre Arts   The place of this course in the curriculum is to allow the Theatre faculty to teach intensively in their particular fields of research and expertise and to allow students an in-depth study of one period or movement important in the history of drama. Students become familiar with research tools and methods of a particular period or movement and with the issues surrounding them. May be repeated for credit. Offered occasionally.490  Senior Theatre Festival   Majors in Theatre Arts undertake a su-pervised thesis project in their main area of interest. This could include dramaturgy, design, acting, or directing.

Prerequisite: approval of tutorial professor and the Internship Coordinator.202     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Academic Support ProgramsACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMSAcademic AdvisingDirector: Landon WadeProgram MissionThe mission of the Office of Academic Advising is to support faculty advisors in providing effective guidance for students and recent alum-ni as they make their academic plans. The office also offers direct support to students at each stage of the academic decision-making process, from the time they arrive through graduation, and is available with recent graduates in planning post-baccalaureate education plans.First-Year Advising ProgramThe First-Year Advising Program provides guidance from the moment a student enters the university. Specially assigned faculty advisors offer first-year students not only direction in their choice of classes, but also insight into the nature and importance of a university education. Faculty advisors help to plan incoming students’ academic programs on the basis of their backgrounds, abilities, interests, and goals.Each first-year student participates in the selection of his or her advisor. Beginning in May, prospective students indicate their pref-erences to the advising director, who then assigns them to advisors. In most cases, a first-year student’s advisor will also be one of his or her instructors, ensuring the student’s opportunity to seek help at any time. This classroom contact also cultivates the advising relationship between students and faculty; students, comfortable with an advisor they have come to know as teacher, find it easy to discuss not only which classes to take next term but also which academic programs and career paths to consider. Additionally, all first-year students are assigned peer advisors, upper-division students who can help new students get to know and thrive in Puget Sound’s academic programs. First-year students meet with their advisors during fall orientation to finalize their fall schedules. First-year students work with their advisors through the sophomore year or until declaring a major; majors must be declared by the end of the sophomore year. When students declare a major, they are required to choose an advisor in their discipline of choice, though they may maintain their advising relationship with their first-year advisor. A student may have more than one advisor, as in the case of double majors, for example, but only the student’s advisor of record may approve registration for classes.Transfer Student Advising ProgramTransfer students are assigned to faculty advisors according to students’ expressed academic interests. Advisors help transfer students assess their standing toward the degree in their chosen field of study and work with them in long-range academic and career planning.Continuing Student Advising Program and Academic Decision-MakingFaculty advisor assistance in academic and career planning continues for students throughout their academic careers and includes regular meetings to discuss academic programs and requirements along with the relationship of academic programs to career and/or further educational goals. Academic Advising also offers resources and counseling to assist students in choosing appropriate academic majors.Student Alert Program and Academic SupportAcademic Advising leads a campus-wide early alert network for stu-dents with academic and personal concerns and offers support for students in academic difficulty. Referrals to the Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching; Counseling, Health, and Wellness Services; and other services across campus ensure students have access to resourc-es, inside and outside of the classroom. Graduate School PreparationApproximately one in five Puget Sound students go on to graduate or professional school immediately after graduation, and nearly half enroll in graduate programs within five years of graduation. Recognizing this, both faculty advisors and the Office of Academic Advising offer support and counsel for students planning further education.Health Professions AdvisingChair: Joyce Tamashiro Associate Advisor: Jennifer Allen-AyresThe Health Professions Advising Office provides special career coun-seling, practice interviews, letters of evaluation, and assistance in the application process for students who aspire to careers in the fields of medicine, veterinary medicine, dentistry, physician assistant, optometry, nursing, pharmacy, and related fields. Students interested in occupational therapy or physical therapy should contact the School of Occupational Therapy or School of Physical Therapy at Puget Sound. Students inter-ested in careers in the health professions may major in any subject, but should meet minimum requirements in the sciences, mathematics, and other courses specified by the professional schools. In addition, national standardized admission examinations are required of applicants to most professional programs. Students intending to apply to medical school should complete the following courses before taking the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT): "
THTR 252," World Theatre II: Asian TheatresMajor RequirementsStudents must declare their major area of study through the Office of Academic Advising by the end of their sophomore year. A major con-sists of a minimum of 8 units outlined within a de partment/school or program. One major is required of all graduates. At least 4 units of the major must be completed in residence at Puget Sound. A 2.0 minimum grade-point average is re quired both for those courses completed at Puget Sound and elsewhere. Courses counting toward the major may not be taken pass/fail unless they are mandatory pass/fail courses.Graduation with Two MajorsStudents may earn the baccalaureate degree with two majors. Whichever major is declared as the first major controls the degree to be awarded. Both majors must be completed before the degree is awarded.Minor RequirementsAn minor is not required for a degree. If the student elects to earn a minor, it must consist of a minimum of 5 units within the minor area. At least 3 of these must be completed in residence at Puget Sound. Specific requirements for the minor are established by the individual mi-nor area. A 2.0 minimum grade-point average is required both for those courses completed at Puget Sound and elsewhere. Minors must be completed before the degree is awarded. A student may not major and minor in the same department. Courses counting toward the minor may not be taken pass/fail unless they are mandatory pass/fail courses.Simultaneous Baccalaureate DegreesStudents who wish to earn two baccalaureate degrees simultaneously must complete:a. university requirements for a baccalaureate degree with two majors, b.  a minimum of 40 total units and a minimum of 24 units in resi-dence, c.  a minimum of 6 of the last 8 units in residence. For purposes of other academic policies, simultaneously earned de-grees may both be considered “first” degrees.Second Baccalaureate DegreeStudents who wish to earn a second baccalaureate degree must com-plete a minimum of 8 additional academic and graded units in residence subsequent to the awarding of the first bac calaureate degree. Students are required to complete departmental requirements current as of the date of post-baccalaureate enrollment.

Liberal arts de-grees are valuable and instill the education and training that employers in most fields say are crucial—communication, team-work, writing, and critical thinking.  However, liberal arts majors are not inherently linked to one, or even a few, specific careers. This course assists students in their search for programs of study, to focus on major review and selec-tion using concrete actions and plans to explore liberal arts disciplines based on students’ interests, strengths, weaknesses, and post-bacca-laureate goals.  This course is designed for students who have complet-ed at least one semester of study at the university, sophomore standing with no declared major is required.

Susan Owen, Communication Studies; Renee Simms, African American Studies; Carolyn Weisz, Psychology.About the ProgramAfrican American Studies is an interdisciplinary program. The program focuses on African American experiences, while recognizing that other academic subjects bear importantly on the understanding of these experiences and should have a place in the African American Studies curriculum. Within the interrogative, interdisciplinary, reflexive, and justice orient-ed mode that guides African American Studies, students in the program acquire sophisticated knowledge of African American and other African diasporic experiences; become conversant with the role of race, power, difference, and intersectionality in the personal, institutional, and struc-tural relations of our daily lives including their relevance for  local, region-al, national, and international affairs; cultivate rigorous transdisciplinary skills in analytic, reflexive, and community-based research methodolo-gies, and written, oral, and multi-media communication, to formulate, articulate, and interrogate ideas in private and public spheres; develop critical, intellectual, and ethical perspectives that can guide and advance personal, educational, civic, political, and professional actions; and en-gage and interact with differential sites of community development and leadership in the Puget Sound and beyond so as to deepen and apply their understanding of African American Studies and to learn to contrib-ute collaboratively to the ongoing work of equity.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below.Requirements for the MajorA major in African American Studies consists of 9 units:1. : World Theatre II: Asian Theatres (Knowledge, Identity,     Power Graduation Requirement), 254, and 256. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 252  World Theatre II: Asian Theatres   Through the lens of tradition and innovation, students explore the dramaturgy of Asian theatres from classic forms (e.g., Noh drama) to contemporary plays by Asian American/Canadian authors. Students in this and all contemporary world theatre courses engage with and collaborate in a set of informed, imaginative explorations of plays with a particular emphasis on dramatic action. They work toward the completion of this goal 1) by investigating, in light of performance, a play’s dramaturgy both from within (formally) and from without (historically, culturally); 2) by cutting, arranging, and producing scenes from plays they are studying; 3) by discovering formal and thematic threads that run through the plays, readings, and topics of this class; 4) by considering ways to increase the breadth and depth of theatre productions at Puget Sound through course work grounded in the Knowledge, Identity, and Power rubric. Although contemporary world theatre classes have similar learning outcomes and a common methodology, the plays and fields of study (e.g., African Diaspora, Asian Theatres, Voices of the Americas) differ from one class to an-other.

University Core Texts and Contexts:  Introduction to Literature and Cultural Studies204  The American Dream:  Loss and Renewal   This course for non-majors takes as its starting point the question: “What is the American Dream?” Who has achieved it and who hasn’t? Is it a singular dream or a tapestry of dreams made of many threads? By reading texts from a variety of genres and cultural perspectives, the course examines the themes of identity, betrayal, and redemption.  The course will exam-ine the ways these most central of human experiences can be viewed as distinctly American. Authors studied may include Franklin, Thoreau, Whitman, Twain, as well as Morrison, Silko, and Otsuka.  Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches Core requirement.206  Literature by Women   This course for non-majors examines the work of women writers anywhere from the Medieval Period to the present, with attention to the historical and cultural context of texts.  It asks such questions as the following: what are the canonical issues that arise from a study of women’s literature? Is women’s literature different from literature by men in some essential way? What forces have worked against women writers and what strategies have they often employed to make their voices heard?  How have those strategies shaped the liter-ature that women have produced?  Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches Core requirement and cross-listed in Gender and Queer Studies.Content in Form: Studies in the Literary Aesthetic212  The Craft of Literature   This course provides an introduction for non-majors to the craft of literature, engaging both critical and creative faculties.  Studying and practicing methods of aesthetic and formal anal-ysis of literary texts, students will consider the artistic choices writers make to create an imaginative experience.  Students will also have the opportunity to participate in the creative process.  Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement.213  Biography/Autobiography/Memoir   This course for non-majors focuses on the genre of biography, autobiography, and memoir, and on the writer as subject.  Students will examine this genre critically and creatively, considering how the self both creates and is created by the text.  Students will explore connections and differences among autobi-ography, biography, and memoir, as well as the problem of objectivity.  Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement.EnglishUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     89Foundations220 Introduction to English Studies This course serves as an introduc-tion to the English major and minor and provides a foundation for the study of literature through reading, analyzing, and writing about a variety of literary and non-literary texts. Focusing on the relation between form and content in a range of genres including poetry, fiction, drama, mem-oir, graphic texts, and film, students develop a critical vocabulary and in-terpretive frameworks to engage meaningfully with literature.  Students are also introduced to basic literary research tools, literary criticism, and disciplinary scholarship.  Course content varies by instructor, but all sec-tions include a play by Shakespeare. Required of all majors and minors. Offered each semester.Creative Writing Courses227  Introduction to Writing Fiction   Combining seminar and work-shop formats, the course introduces students to the interstices of imag-ination and narrative theory.  Students read examples of literary fiction and write several short stories of their own.  Students also take one or more stories through deep revision. Offered each semester.228  Introduction to Writing Poetry   Combining seminar and work-shop formats, the course introduces students to the art and craft of writing poetry.  Students experiment with a variety of poetic forms, read the work of poets from many eras, study versification and free verse, expand their range of subjects, and explore different strategies of revi-sion.  By the end of the semester, students will assemble a portfolio of their original poetry. Offered each semester.Works, Cultures, Traditions 231  Medieval and Renaissance Literature   This course introduces students to some of the major works of literature written in Britain from the Anglo-Saxon invasion to the aftermath of the English Civil War in the 17th century. The surviving stories from these centuries are richly diverse in language, form, and genre, and register great shifts, yet also surprising continuities in conceptions of heroism and honor, theories of family and nation, the relationship between the church and the individ-ual, the nature of authority, and humanity’s place in the universe. Thus, strategies for thinking critically about this period’s literature emerge from a combination of close textual analysis and historical context. Readings may include works by the Beowulf-poet, the Gawain-poet, Chaucer, Kempe, the Sidneys, Spenser, Shakespeare, Donne, and Milton.232  British Literature and Culture: Restoration to Reformation   This course surveys British literature from the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 to the first Reform Bill in 1832. During this interval, known as “the long 18th Century,” Britain emerged as the world’s first commer-cial and industrial superpower while it also experienced an immense artistic transformation from the aesthetics of Neoclassicism to those of Romanticism. The course examines the ideas and the aesthetics of Restoration Comedy, Augustan Satire, and Romantic lyrical poetry in relation to their political, philosophical, and literary contexts.233  British Literature and Culture: From Victoria to the Present   This course explores the literature and culture of the British Isles from the 1830s to the present.  Covering three broad and rich periods—the Victorian era, Modernism, and Postmodernism—the roughly two cen-turies under study will be brought into focus by a significant theme (to be determined by the professor) as it manifests itself across the three periods and through particular writers, genres, and movements.  Writers under study may include poets such as Tennyson, Browning, Barrett Browning, Yeats, Walcott, and Boland; novelists such as Brontë, Dickens, Woolf, and Rushdie; and playwrights such as Wilde, Osborne, Friel, and Churchill.234  American Literature and Culture: Colonial to Early National   This course offers a thematic introduction to significant developments in American literary history from European contact through the early-na-tional era of the late-18th and early-19th Century. Focusing on literary works in relation to their socio-historical contexts and drawing upon a variety of genres and voices, this course provides students with a foun-dational understanding of important traditions and transformations in literary history and aesthetics. Themes and readings vary by semester; consult the department for current information.235  American Literature and Culture: Long Nineteenth Century   This course offers a thematic introduction to significant developments in American literary history from the long 19th Century, spanning the post-Revolutionary era to World War I. Focusing on literary works in relation to their socio-historical contexts (e.g., Transcendentalism, U.S. Expansionism, the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Gilded Age) and drawing upon a variety of genres, this course provides students with a foundational understanding of important traditions and transformations in literary history and aesthetics. Themes and readings vary by semes-ter; consult the department for current information.236  American Literature and Culture: Modern and Contemporary   This course offers a thematic introduction to significant developments in American literary history from the early 20th century through the contemporary moment.  Focusing on literary works in relation to their socio-historical contexts (e.g., WWI and WWII, the Great Depression, the Civil Rights Movement, the fall of the Berlin Wall) and drawing upon a variety of genres, this course provides students with a foundational understanding of important traditions and transformations in literary history and aesthetics. Themes and readings vary by semester; consult the department for current information.237  American Literature and Culture: Beyond Borders This course engages with developments in American literary history that precede, complicate, or challenge nationalist frameworks. It focuses on the U.S. nation and/or its colonial antecedents through a lens that is transnational or multinational, considering the space we now identify as “America” (U.S.) in relation to a variety of identities, traditions, and cultures that have circulated within and around it. The course thus emphasizes an an-ti-exceptionalist approach to American literature, focusing instead on the circulation of ideas about or in relation to the American U.S. within larger cultural or global contexts. Historical periods and themes vary according to instructor and may include comparative colonial or imperial literatures, trans-Atlantic traditions, or America in its various international, multi-na-tional or post-national contexts. Course sub-topics might include but are not limited to the following: Anglo-American literary relations, narratives of colonization, Caribbean-American contexts, the Atlantic slave trade, U.S.-Mexico or hemispheric relations, literatures of transnational or in-ternational migration, the U.S. in a global world. Offered every third year.240 Multimodal Composition This course offers students an introduc-tion to multimodal composition. Building upon its theoretical foundation, the course allows for composition across various mediums. Assignments could include soundscapes using digital content, short documentary films, and reimagined commonplace books for the interpretation and analysis of multimodal texts. Modes of communication under study and production include linguistic, visual, spatial, gestur-al, and aura.  242  Introduction to Native American Literature This course is a survey of Native American literature from beginnings to the contempo-English90     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  rary moment. Students gain awareness of tribal distinctions and points of critical and socio-political concern within the field of study. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power requirement.245  Shakespeare: From Script to Stage  This course offers students an introduction to the development of Shakespeare’s plays in an early-mod-ern cultural context. Students learn to appreciate Shakespeare’s rhetoric and poetics; approaches to genre and literary convention; exploration of political, intellectual, theological, cosmological, epistemological, moral and social constructs; treatment of gender, sexuality, and early modern identity; and creative use of the physical space of various “play spaces” (both public and private) that inspired his dramatic imagination.247 Introduction to Popular Genres   This topics course offers an introduction to the fiction of a designated popular genre (fairy tales, sci-fi, detective fiction, romance, etc…), covering constitutive elements of the genre and its history. Readings explore both conventional and exper-imental iterations of the genre, and consider the relationship between individual works, the conventions of genre, and their specific social contexts. In this course students think about the relationship between formal conventions, subject positions, and historical context, to gain a better understanding of the ways in which popular fiction reflects, refracts, or even challenges popular mores. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power requirement.Sleuthing Justice: Multi-Ethnic Detective Fiction   This course examines the ways in which writers from diverse backgrounds utilize the de-tective fiction genre to speculate about the nature of justice, agency, and social structure. The course will briefly limn the origins and initial conventions of detective and noir fiction of the 19th century before turning its focus to the 20th and 21st cen-turies, with an emphasis on the formal and thematic features that undergird the genre. Exploring specific social histories that these fictions describe – and from which they arise – students will ex-plore the myriad ways in which the figure of the detective evolves in response to historical vagaries, factors which may include labor antagonisms, anti-communism, the Civil Rights Movement, the transition in the U.S. to a consumer and infor-mation economy, immigration and the rise of multiculturalism, the proliferation of corporate culture, and the increase in class stratification. Constructing KnowledgeCreative Writing Courses325  Playwriting   The course introduces students to the art and craft of playwriting by combining seminar and workshop formats in which members write, present, and revise monologues, dialogues, and sketch-es.  Students work toward a final portfolio of this material as well as the completion of a short one-act play. The course also involves the analysis and discussion of published, produced plays; of conflict, suspense, characterization, plot, and other elements of drama; and of writing with actors, directors, producers, dramaturgs, and theatre audiences in mind.

What does the future hold for our climate? Is it possible for a computer to understand natural language? How can we most efficiently and securely transmit information over the Internet? When is it useful to distinguish between different levels of infinity?Mathematics and computer science provide the critical foundation required to answer some of the most pivotal and complex questions of our time. Mathematicians design the models that enable us to under-stand and improve the structure of transportation networks, computer networks and physical processes, making them more efficient, effective, and versatile. Whether or not practical applications are foreseen, mathe-maticians revel in exploring the structure and beauty of abstract patterns, logical relationships, and rigorous formal proofs. Computer scientists build the invisible layer of software that drives significant advances in scientific research and improves everyday life. The newest smart phones are driven by tens of millions of lines of computer code, while a modern automobile includes over one hundred million lines of code—every as-pect of which we depend upon for our productivity and safety. To equip students with the conceptual knowledge to tackle such problems, the curriculum for the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science stresses the development of problem-solving techniques, logical reasoning, and data analysis. Special emphasis is placed on the value of abstraction: the process of simplifying a messy real-world problem to focus on the relevant details. Consistent with the university’s core curriculum, the department provides a learning environment that encourages both independent thinking and group collaboration. Communication is of paramount importance; students learn to clearly articulate the nature of the problem, the analysis pro-cess, and the solution. Students who choose to study mathematics join a discipline that has been an important part of society for at least four thousand years. The foundation for a major in mathematics is formed by completing a sequence of three courses in calculus, and a course in linear algebra. Of calculus, Morris Kline wrote, “Following hard on the adoption of the function concept came the calculus, which, next to Euclidean geometry, is the greatest creation of all of mathematics.” Linear algebra shares in the beauty, power and applicability of the cal-culus by providing a rich theory for modeling real world phenomena by means of systems of linear equations. Building upon this foundation, students can select from a number of upper-division mathematics courses that broaden and deepen their understanding of mathematics, exploring areas such as abstract algebra, real and complex analysis, probability and statistics, mathematical modeling, and optimization.Students studying computer science begin by learning how to write computer programs, but computer science is far more than just pro-gramming. Among other pursuits, computer scientists design and study algorithms (computational problem solving strategies) to solve difficult real-world problems, learn software engineering patterns to break down large projects into manageable pieces, and study the design of programming languages themselves. Those choosing to major or minor in computer science will have the opportunity to explore a rich set of elective courses, including artificial intelligence, computer graphics, database management systems, networks, and operating systems. For students with an interest in business, there is also an option to pursue an interdisciplinary Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Business. Students majoring in either mathematics or computer science will have the opportunity to join a strong community, through participation in a variety of student-initiated and faculty-sponsored groups. The depart-ment hosts a student-run Mathematics Club (first begun in 1927), and offers two faculty-guided problem-solving seminars preparing students to compete in the annual Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and Putnam contests. The department also features a local chapter of the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) and  a computer game development club, in which artists and computer science students are teaming up to create a new computer game. The study of mathematics and computer science prepares students to enter a world in which computational and mathematical literacy are crucial. Many of our students move on to graduate study, and ultimately pursue careers in business, research, industry, education, government, and actuarial work, among others. Whether considering a major in math-ematics or computer science, building the foundation for another disci-pline, or simply developing the quantitative literacy required to interact in an increasingly quantitative world, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science provides the strategies and conceptual understand-ing to help students reach these goals. Students who graduate from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science will be able to communicate precisely in the formal language of mathematics or computer science, both verbally and in written form, work effectively individually and as part of a team, and leverage the power of abstraction to transform complex problems into simpler but conceptually relevant ones. Additionally, students completing a degree in mathematics will be able to:• Demonstrate an understanding of the core ideas in calculus and linear algebra, as well as a breadth or depth of understanding in other mathematical subject areas;• Write clear and correct mathematical proofs;• Successfully transition to advanced study in any of a range of pure or applied mathematical subject areas.Computer science graduates will additionally be able to:• Choose and apply appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve a problem;• Analyze the correctness, efficiency, and viability of algorithms;• Implement and evaluate complex software systems using a variety of tools.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science offers cours-es cross-listed as both Mathematics and Computer Science as indicated in their course descriptions. A student majoring or minoring in both 144     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Mathematics and Computer ScienceMathematics and Computer Science may apply only one such course to both majors, to both the major and the minor, or to both minors.The Bachelor of Science in MathematicsThe department offers two options for a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics: a contract major and a standard major. The contract major emphasizes the value of planning a coherent set of courses based on goals and interests articulated by the student. The contract major also allows the flexibility of including a course from another department if the course has sufficient mathematical content and relates to the stu-dent’s interests. The standard major is available for those students who declare a mathematics major later in their undergraduate career.Contract option for the Bachelor of Science in MathematicsThis degree is awarded on the basis of a course of study agreed upon by the student and a committee of faculty members. A student who in-tends to complete a contract major in Mathematics should select a fac-ulty member in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science as an advisor. The student and advisor form a committee that consists of one additional faculty member from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science and, if a course from another department is to be part of the contract, a faculty member from that department. The student works with the committee to select a coherent set of courses (satisfying the requirements given below) that advances the student’s educational goals. The contract is signed by the student, committee members, and chair of the department, and is filed in the Office of the Registrar. The student can later modify the contract with the approval of all committee members and the department chair.Each contract course of study will meet the following requirements.1.

We offer language instruction to serve all proficiency levels, from beginners to students with native or near-native language skills. In our upper-division courses, students hone their research, writing, and public speaking skills and explore key questions posed by literary and cultural studies about the Spanish-speaking world: the United States, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Spain.We address the needs of traditional students of Spanish as a foreign language; of heritage speakers for whom Spanish is a part of their family history; and of bilingual and bicultural students whose first language is English but who enter the university as near-native speakers of Spanish.In addition to our traditional mission preparing students to function in Spanish in a foreign setting, the Department of Hispanic Studies encour-ages students to become proficient in Spanish language and cultures within and outside the borders of the United States. Our curriculum em-braces the rich variety of Spanish in the U.S., the centuries-old histories of Latino communities all over the nation, and their current demograph-ic, cultural, and political relevance.  Fostering the development of en-gaged citizens who are able to thrive in our increasingly bilingual nation is of central importance to our mission. In that way we assist students to prepare themselves to use Spanish as citizens and professionals on a daily basis and to understand the complexities and nuances of Hispanic cultures in the U.S. as well as abroad.Majors in Hispanic Studies are well prepared for graduate studies in Spanish. They are also well qualified to pursue post-graduate degrees and entry-level work in fields such as law, business, education, journal-ism, and medicine. Frequently, our graduating majors have integrated their studies of Spanish language and cultures with coursework in other disciplines and pursue careers in fields such as international busi-ness, the non-profit sector, government, human and immigrant rights work, travel, and communications, all of which value their expertise in Hispanic Studies highly.Students who graduate from the Hispanic Studies Department will be able to:•  Communicate in Spanish personally and professionally on a daily basis•  Demonstrate a high level of critical sophistication as readers of complex literary texts•  Engage critically and deliberately with challenging theoretical ques-tions on a wide variety of topics in the field•  Prepare and execute effective oral presentations in Spanish and write solid research papers on Hispanic literary and cultural studies •  Understand the complexities and nuances of Hispanic cultures in the U.S. and abroad •  Demonstrate an awareness of the linguistic, cultural, racial, and ethnic diversity of Spain, Latin America, and the U.S.•  Act thoughtfully as engaged citizens in our increasingly bilingual communitiesStudy Abroad CourseworkMajors and minors in Hispanic Studies receive credit for coursework earned while studying in departmentally approved study abroad pro-grams only. A list of approved programs is available below. To ensure that credit earned abroad will transfer, students are encouraged to con-sult with a department advisor to discuss their plans for foreign study. The following are the approved programs in the Department of Hispanic Studies. No University credit in Spanish will be awarded for coursework carried out in programs other than the following:118     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Hispanic StudiesIFSA/Butler Buenos Aires (Argentina)CIEE Valparaíso (Chile)UPS/PLU Oaxaca (Mexico)ILACA Granada (Spain)Madrid Summers (Spain)PlacementNormally, first year students in their first semester who have completed a minimum of three solid years of Spanish courses in high-school are qualified to enroll in Spanish 201 (Intermediate Spanish I).

The underlying assump-tion of all aspects of the Asian Studies Program is that the vast region labeled “Asia” is complex and diverse and that varied Asian peoples and institutions have greatly influenced, and continue to influence, human experience throughout the world. Faculty members with Asian language and area expertise are members of many different departments, and the Asian Studies Program brings together courses from multiple depart-ments and programs for interdisciplinary engagement. In the subsidiary program of Asian Languages and Cultures (see below), students may major or minor in Japanese or Chinese. The program also offers the uni-versity’s unique Pacific Rim/Asia Study-Travel Program (see below).The Asian Studies Program offers an Interdisciplinary Minor in Asian Studies. Students in the minor who demonstrate academic excellence and complete a one-semester senior thesis will achieve the added des-ignation of Robert Trimble Distinguished Asia Scholar.Students who graduate with the Interdisciplinary Minor in Asian Studies will be able to:1. Demonstrate familiarity with the cultural traditions and contempo-rary societies of Asia, and understand those cultures and societies within the Asian and world contexts;2. Analyze, understand, and discuss coherently difficult texts about those Asian cultures and societies;3. Formulate abstract ideas and write logically and clearly in English about those Asian cultures;4. Make informed judgments about a world of many cultures and about their own society as viewed by others.Subsidiary Programs Asian Languages and Cultures ProgramThe Asian Languages and Cultures Program offers majors and minors grounded in a strong foundation of language and draws on the broad range of culture courses offered by the Asian Studies faculty. The pro-gram offers two majors and two minors, as well as Chinese and Japanese literature courses that fulfill requirements toward the Asian Studies Minor, and language courses that meet the university’s foreign language require-ment. For information on major requirements, see the Asian Languages and Cultures section of this bulletin.PacRim Program The Pacific Rim/Asia Study-Travel Program (PacRim) is scheduled every three years (next in Asia 2020–2021), and offers a full academic year of courses taught at different locations in Asia. Approximately 25 stu-dents participate in the program through a process of formal application. Participants prepare in advance of the scheduled study-travel year by passing specified prerequisite courses in the Asian Studies Program and a non-credit orientation taught by the PacRim Directors.Additional OpportunitiesIn addition to Asian Languages and Cultures and PacRim, the Asian Studies Program offers special opportunities for all students, includ-ing Charles Garnet Trimble Scholarships for continuing upper division students seeking the Asian Studies Minor or majoring in Japanese or Chinese, and Trimble scholarship grants for study abroad in Asia. Furthermore, the program provides a context for the Miki Fellowship for a post-graduate year in Japan and offers a postgraduate English-instructorship at Hwa Nan Women’s College in Fuzhou, China. For stu-dents seeking to become Robert Trimble Distinguished Asia Scholars (described below), Trimble summer research grants prior to the senior thesis are also available.The Asian Studies Colloquium is a co-curricular series of presenta-tions by guest speakers, special films, and other cultural events to pro-mote campus awareness of, and knowledge about, Asia. Meetings and events occur on an irregular basis and are open to the entire university community and especially to students enrolled in courses listed under the Asian Studies Program. For information, see the Director of the Asian Studies Program.University Requirements Asian studies courses are represented in the First-Year Seminar program (see list of courses, below), although these do not count toward the Asian Studies Minor.

Through theoretical readings and case studies, stu-dents receive a broad grounding in classical and contemporary theories of religion, including comparative psychoanalytic, anthropological, femi-nist, and postmodern approaches. In addition to locating religious stud-ies within wider intellectual movements, the course is designed to help students articulate the values and assumptions they bring to their own studies of religion. Offered every fall. 342  Sufism   For some Muslims, Sufism (Islamic mysticism) is the defining essence of Islam, without which one is left with only a mean-ingless shell for a religion. For other Muslims, Sufism stands as the satanic antithesis to God’s singular, eternal truth. What then is Sufism? And why does it elicit such fervent reactions from its champions and detractors alike? This course proposes to answer these very questions. After an introductory look at various definitions and manifestations of Sufism today and in the past, students begin with an historical survey of the earliest precedents and intellectual currents in the development of Sufism. Students continue with a study of Sufi poetry, terminology, institutions, and rituals. Additionally, students look at key Sufi personali-ties, both men and women. The final part of the course examines mod-ern Islamic intellectual trends and their effects on debates and discus-sions within the study and practice of Sufism in the twentieth century. The course returns in the end to contemporary Sufism and the diverse forms that it assumes across the globe today. Offered occasionally.350  Mysticism: The Spiritual Search in the Christian Tradition   Mysticism describes a variety of ways in which humans endeavor to encounter the divine directly. The Christian tradition has a long history of mystical encounters, which are founded in the Hebrew Scriptures and in Paul’s experience on the road to Damascus. As a text-based religion, Christianity has a complicated relationship with mysticism, since mysti-cism tends to focus on the directly experiential rather than the textual. And, even as they claimed that such experiences transcended language and expression, mystics often sought to express their experiences. This course examines the ways in which a mystical tradition developed in Christianity, and in which particular metaphors and images came to hold sway. In doing so, it pays attention to the wider social and political context in which the authors wrote and lived, and asks whether these mystics, particularly women, were able to acquire authority and charis-Religious StudiesUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     187ma outside of the Church hierarchy. The course thus examines the ways in which mystics occupied an ambivalent space in Western Christianity. The clerical hierarchy has historically sought to limit charisma and proph-ecy. Mystics thus both threatened the official hierarchy, which sought to limit charisma, but also, sometimes, reinforced the status quo. Questions about power, the body, textuality, charisma, social structures, and authority will be central to our investigation of the Christian mystical tradition. Offered occasionally.363  Saints, Symbols and Sacraments: History of Christian Traditions   This course surveys the major developments in Christian history from its origins up to the current day. In the first half of the course, the focus is on patterns of Christian thought including insti-tutional changes and social context up to 1500 CE. Although this is largely a story of the clerical hierarchy in the Latin West, wherever possible the course emphasizes the role of lay persons, women and Eastern Christianity. In the second half of the course, the focus is on the challenges to Christianity posed by modernity including the Protestant movement, the Enlightenment, the New World, and the liberation move-ment among women, minorities, and third world peoples. Readings are from both primary and secondary sources. Offered occasionally.368  Gender Matters   An in-depth study of feminist theory, theology, and ethics, and the role such theories have played in Western social and religious thought. Among the issues explored are justice, violence, the body, sexuality, knowledge, power. The course draws upon one or more of the following theoretical insights: liberationist, post-structuralist, standpoint, virtue, or Marxist theories. Prior work in religion, women stud-ies, sociology and anthropology, philosophy, or feminist political theory is helpful, as well as a facility with writing. Counts toward the minor in Gender and Queer Studies. Offered frequently.410  Religion and Violence  Do religions originate in myths of violence, and then re-enact them, as in the Eucharist? How do sacred texts en-shrine and commemorate violence? How do religions motivate, justify or reinforce violence? What role does ritual play in re-enacting violence?  What roles do eschatological expectations play in violence? How has the postcolonial world grappled with the questions of religious violence? This class explores historical case studies in the relationship between religion and violence, such as the Christian doctrine of just war and the Crusades, the history and practice of Islamic ideas of jihad, or Hindu nationalistic violence. We also consider the question of self-inflicted violence and suffering, as performed in religious rituals. Students read theoretical works and examine case studies; students are encouraged to elaborate their own understanding of the nature of religion and violence. Prerequisite: two courses in Religious Studies and permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally.420  Law and Religion  Notwithstanding the many attempts around the world to separate them, the spheres of law and religion repeatedly over-lap in their histories  and will continue to intersect into the foreseeable future. Both spheres  reflect the deepest of humanistic concerns; both serve as arenas for contesting and projecting the authority of individuals, institutions, and texts within all human contexts. Law and religion chart the contours of our personal, social, and civizational identities along with the relationships between these identities and their relation to the other, both in its sentient  and non-sentient forms. This seminar examines the intersection of law and religion within a broad sampling of historical and contemporary contexts. It does so with the goal of identifying the ques-tions and debates that account for these intersections. The first half of the course surveys the most influential legal systems that are grounded in what is known conventionally as a religious tradition. The second part of the course turns its attention to what is known conventionally as secular models of law to discern how such models define religion and locate themselves in relation to it. Offered occasionally.440  The Body in Comparative Religions   While the field of religious studies frequently focuses on belief and the intellectual development of religious traditions, this course shifts its focus to the body and its importance for the study of religion. The class examines the role of the body as a vehicle through which individuals experience “the sacred,” and as a site upon which communities inscribe, assert, and contest reli-gious values. Taking a comparative approach toward cases drawn from Buddhism, Christianity, and indigenous traditions, the class explores such themes as the perfectible body, the body in pain, bodily relics, the body in ritual, and transcending the body altogether. Finally, by drawing on classical and contemporary theorists, students work to develop their own frameworks through which to understand and interpret the crucial role of the body in the history of religions. Prerequisite: two courses in Religious Studies or permission of the instructor. Offered occasionally. 450  Modernity and its Discontents   This advanced seminar explores the ideas and values that distinguish modernity from traditional and pre-modern cultures. Students examine the meaning and development of modernity from a variety of perspectives, including the shifting role and relevance of religion in the modern world. Important sources for the cultural critique of modernity include Nietzsche, Freud, Benjamin, Guenon, T.S. Eliot, Heidegger, and Bataille. Prerequisite: at least two courses in Religious Studies and permission of instructor. Offered fre-quently.456  Ethics and Postmodernity   This advanced seminar for Religious Studies majors takes up the question of what place (if any) religious and social ethics has in postmodern culture. In other words, what charac-terizes postmodernity and what has been its effects on the discipline of ethics? Are there any prospects for a common morality given the re-alities of post-structuralist deconstruction? How will one determine the appropriateness of an ethic for postmodern culture? Prerequisite: two courses in Religious Studies or permission of instructor. Priority given to upper-level Religious Studies majors; open to other students with per-mission of instructor. Offered occasionally.460  Religious Technologies  This advanced seminar theorizes the intersections of religion and technology as a critical site for exploring broad topics in religious studies. The course will take various approach-es to relations among religion, technique, and knowledge production: we examine rhetorical constructions of the religious and the technolog-ical; explore religious influences on invention and scientific progress; analyze spiritual ideals and contemporary machines; and theorize ways that religious practices and traditions operate as techniques and special-ized knowledges. Course topics will include steam-propelled engines and electromagnetism, physical regimens and body modification, car-tography and cyberspace, confession and self-help. With attention to interdisciplinary method, students will also work on a specific project throughout the semester that proceeds through topic selection, ques-tion formulation, research, analysis, and argumentation to produce a final research paper. Prerequisite: Two courses in REL and instructor permission. Offered occasionally.  494  Special Topics   This seminar is organized around themes and topics that are of special interest to the study of religion. The seminar is offered on an occasional basis and the topic is determined in advance by the instructor. Prerequisite: at least two courses in Religious Studies or permis-sion of instructor. Offered occasionally.495/496  Independent Study  Religious Studies188     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Science, Technology, and SocietySCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETYProfessor: James Evans; Kristin Johnson, DirectorAssistant Professor: Amy Fisher Advisory Committee: James Evans, Physics/Science, Technology, and Society; Amy Fisher, Science, Technology, and Society; Barry Goldstein, Geology; Wade Hands, Economics; Suzanne Holland, Religious Studies; Kristin Johnson, Science, Technology, and Society; Justin Tiehen, PhilosophyAbout the ProgramScience and technology are not isolated activities: they are inextricably linked to every other aspect of human experience. Science and technol-ogy have important connections to literature, philosophy, religion, art, economics, and to social and political history. Scientific evidence and argument are part of continuing lively debates on issues at every level of generality: social policy, the utilization of natural resources, the alloca-tion of health care, the origin and evolution of life, the place of human-kind in the natural order, and the nature of the universe. Science, Technology, and Society courses explore the connections between the sciences and other parts of the human endeavor. Students in the program develop an understanding of 1) how the broader culture influences the development of science and how science influences dif-ferent societies and cultures, and 2) the interplay between science and economics, politics, religion, and values in contemporary decision making. Many Science, Technology, and Society courses are cross-disciplinary in nature. Faculty from more than a dozen different disciplines within and without the sciences participate in Science, Technology, and Society.Majors in the Program in Science, Technology, and Society develop a strong understanding of the practice of science and technology, which provides excellent preparation for careers in medicine, law, public policy, and university research and teaching. Minors, especially those majoring in a science, and students taking individual courses broaden their understand-ing of this important area of human endeavor.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. Requirements for the MajorThe Bachelor of Arts degree in Science, Technology, and Society is awarded on the basis of a course of study agreed upon by the student and a committee of faculty members. During the sophomore year or by the first semester of the junior year, a student who intends to major in Science, Technology, and Society should meet with the director of the Program to select a faculty member as an advisor. The student and advi-sor form a committee that includes the advisor and others members from the Advisory Committee for the Program in Science, Technology, and Society. The committee may include faculty outside the program if the student’s interests overlap with that faculty member’s discipline. The stu-dent works with the committee to select a coherent set of courses that advance the student’s educational goals. The committee usually seeks a balance between breadth of coverage and focus in the student’s particu-lar area of interest.  The committee will also ensure that there is sufficient concentration in STS courses (in distinction from courses in cognate disci-plines that are accepted as electives). The contract goes into effect after it is signed by the student, the committee members, and the director of the Program and is filed in the Office of the Registrar. The contract is re-viewed periodically and justified modifications are permitted. Requirements for the Contract in Science, Technology, and SocietyEvery contract should consist of a minimum of 12 units distributed as follows: 1. Introductory Surveys: 2 units.   "

Offered frequently.331  International Political Economy of Food and Agriculture   Everyone eats, and therefore everyone has a relationship to global agri-culture.  But because less than one percent of the US population earns a living from farming, most Americans rarely think about where our food comes from.  This course explores the origins of our current global food system, the political-economic relations that structure it, and emerging alternatives to industrial food. The course begins with an overview of the global food system, including the actors and ideas that have shaped its historical development. Second, students examine the dominant para-digm of industrial agriculture and the politics of its organization primarily in the US context.  Finally, students discuss some of the most prescient debates over the future of our food system with a focus on the local con-text. Note: this course includes a required weekly three-hour experiential session in addition to regular class sessions. This experiential session provides students the opportunity for hands-on learning through field trips, volunteering, and community-based projects. Students use class materials to bring an analytical lens to these experiences, and the course culminates in a major research project and presentation that engages lo-cal community gardeners.

An Exploration of Popular Culture in 20th and 21st Century East Asia   For the first half of the twentieth century, China and Japan were most often viewed as sites of imperialism and war. During the second half of the twentieth century, discussions of Japan focused on its economic boom while discussion of China focused on the entrenchment of the Chinese Community Party. While this course gives attention to major political and economic developments in East Asia during the past century, the focus is on East Asia as a site of cul-tural production. Among the sources are critical essays in the 1910s meant to spur China towards literary and cultural revolution, anime that explores post-apocalyptic visions of Japan, and Mandopop songs that contemplate what it means to be young and modern in China today. All of these sources examine interactions within East Asia and between East and West in the development and dissemination of popular culture during the past century. Offered occasionally.344  Asia in Motion   This course explores the interactions of Asian peoples and the commodities, social practices, and ideas which they produce across borders, both political and imagined.  The course crosses disciplinary borders, as well, drawing upon divergent materials from the humanities and social sciences in an attempt to do justice to a contemporary context that could be called ‘Asia in motion.’ An under-lying thesis holds that, since nineteenth-century colonialism, nations in the ‘West’ and ‘Asia’ participate in a global, dialectical movement in which notions of identity (national, cultural, ethnic, religious, territorial, linguistic) share moments of fluidity and fixity. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.  Satisfies the Connections core requirement. Offered spring term only.345  Reflective Analysis of Southeast Asian Experiential Field School  .25 unit  This course is designed to allow students returning from experiential field schools in Southeast Asia to reflect on their field experiences in the region, to work collaboratively on projects related to those field experiences, and to present their projects at the annual Luce Initiative on Asian Studies and the Environment (LIASE) Southeast Asia Symposium.

Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered occasionally.489  One-Semester Senior Thesis   This course consists of inde-pendent research and the preparation of a significant paper of original scholarship. Each student seeking the Minor in Asian Studies as Robert Trimble Distinguished Asia Scholar must initiate a topic, identify a super-vising instructor in the Asian Studies Program, and develop a plan for re-search, writing, and public presentation of the project (normally presen-tation will be in an Asian Studies Colloquium). Alternatively, a student may meet the one-semester thesis requirement for the Distinguished Asia Scholar distinction in Asian Studies by an approved research sem-inar in a department participating in the Asian Studies Program. For those participating in the PacRim Program, this course requires of stu-dents a research and writing project on Asian life and thought working either with the director or another faculty member of the Asian Studies Committee. Each student initiates a topic and conducts bibliographical research on campus and research on site during the year in Asia as part of the Pacific Rim/Asia Study-Travel Program.

This program of study en-compasses work in the fields of biology, natural science, neuroscience, religion, philosophy, literature, sociology, psychology, politics, econom-ics, and business. It enables students to study topics at the intersection of the life sciences and the humanities (broadly conceived) such as: re-generative medicine and human stem cell research, global health, race, culture, gender and health care, global warming, human and animal experimentation, genetic screening and gene therapy, human population growth, genetics, embryology, reproduction, death and dying, disability studies, neuroscience, and human/animal psychology. The program prepares students for analyzing and understanding the ethical, moral, cultural and historical dimensions of problems at the nexus of these topics. Faculty drawn from several disciplines and departments provide the unique cross-disciplinary perspective that is the hallmark of this concentration.The Bioethics Program at Puget Sound helps students to analyze, understand, and integrate the challenging issues facing society as a result of advances in medicine, health and science. In keeping with its interdisciplinary nature the Program in Bioethics, through its de-sign and course work, highlights the following University of Puget Sound curricular goals: An understanding of the interrelationship of knowledge; familiarity with diverse fields of knowledge; the ability to think logically and analytically; the ability to communicate clearly and effectively, both orally and in writing; informed appreciation of self and others as part of a broader humanity in the world environment; an acknowledged set of personal values.The interdisciplinary emphasis program in Bioethics helps to prepare students for a broad range of future careers, or for advanced study in medicine and the health professions, the sciences, research, teaching, law, journalism, public policy, hospital chaplaincy, biotechnology, social work, clinical ethics consultation, genetic counseling, and Master’s pro-grams in Bioethics. Students who successfully complete the program receive a designation on the transcript of “Emphasis in Bioethics.”Requirements for the Interdisciplinary  Emphasis in BioethicsCompletion of six units to include: A.

REL 292," or BIOE/ or BIOE/.) This course is an examination of Western philosophical and religious understandings of moral issues brought on by advances in health care, science and technolo-gy. In this course, students will learn the “Principles approach” to bioeth-ics, as well as other ethical approaches to the difficult moral issues raised by contemporary medical science and its clinical applications. To that end, case analysis will be used extensively in this course. The course is designed to help facilitate connections for students between medical/sci-entific advances, ethics, religious values, and American public policy about technology and health care.

Students may not receive credit for both BIOE/ and BIOE/.Offered frequently.392 Practicum: Clinical Bioethics   This course is an experiential learning course that focuses on the practical application of ethical principles and philosophical reasoning in a clinical health care setting. This course pro-vides the opportunity for students to learn how to identify ethical issues and properly to address them in the clinical setting, as well as to learn the ¿practical approach¿ to real-life clinical issues. Students split time between the classroom and the on-site hospital setting, taking information learned in different clinical settings and learning how to work through ethics is-sues. Students also learn typical duties of a clinical bioethicist including: consultations, education, and policy development/review. Prerequisite: BIOE/ or BIOE/ or BIOE//.Offered frequently.310  Aristotle  This course is a moderately comprehensive and system-atic treatment of Aristotle, including method, metaphysics, psychology, ethics, and politics. It considers Aristotle’s criticism of Plato’s theory of forms and his own views about what is real, the relation of form and matter, the nature of the soul, the highest human good, and the relation of the individual and the community. Offered frequently.311  Classical Chinese Philosophy   This course introduces students to influential philosophical questions in early Chinese thought, such as ones concerning human nature and living the good life. And it ex-poses students to the philosophical ideas of thinkers such as Kongzi (Confucius), Laozi (the fictitious author of Daodejing), Mozi, Zhuangzi, Mengzi (Mencius), Xunzi, and Han Feizi. It is both a course in history of philosophy and a course in comparative philosophy. Hence, students are expected to both develop skills for making historically-informed interpre-tations of these thinkers’ responses to the influential philosophical ques-tions, and to consider their ideas’ relevance to practical and philosophi-cal discourses today. (This course does not assume any background in philosophy or in Sinitic languages.) Offered frequently.312  Latin American Philosophy  This course introduces students to philosophy in Latin America – broadly construed to include Indigenous philosophy and Latinx philosophy in the United States.  The course is especially focused on issues of identity in Latin American Philosophy, to include: 1) Latin American philosophers’ self-conscious discussion about whether there is such a thing as a Latin American Philosophy; 2) alter-native conceptions of self, other, and community in selected indigenous conceptions of the world; 3) issues of gender, race, and identity in Latin American anti-colonial and independence philosophy, liberation philoso-phy, and Latinx philosophy in the United States.320  British Empiricism   This seminar examines the metaphysical and epistemological theories of the British Empiricists of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through close readings of Locke’s Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Berkeley’s The Principles of Human Knowledge, and Hume’s A Treatise of Human Nature. It considers such issues as realism, idealism and skepticism, the nature and scope of scientific knowledge, the nature of the self and self-knowledge, and personal identity. Special consideration is paid to the development of empiricism in the context of scientific and religious controversies in sev-enteenth- and eighteenth- century Britain. Readings in recent secondary literature are also required. Offered occasionally.323  Kant  This course consists of a careful reading of Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, designed to provide a thorough introduction to the epistemological aspect of Kant’s critical philosophy. Philosophical issues discussed include the nature of the human mind, the possibility and extent of human knowledge, the reality of space and time, the basis of mathematics and logic, self and personal identity, the foundations of nat-ural science, matter and substance, force and causation, the origin and composition of the universe, freedom of the will, the existence and prop-erties of God, teleology, and the basis of morality. Offered occasionally.325  19th-Century Philosophy  This course is an introduction to philo-sophical systems of Hegel, Feuerbach, Marx, J.S. Mill, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. Topics include the nature of history and historical change, the extent of human freedom, the relation between individuals and their cul-tures, the historical and psychological importance of religious, moral, and philosophical consciousness, and the nature of truth. Offered frequently.330  Epistemology  Epistemology, otherwise known as the theory of knowledge, addresses issues about the nature of knowledge, justifica-tion, and truth, issues that arise from questions such as “How do you know?” and “Can you be sure?” It has been an especially lively area of philosophy in English in recent decades; many currents in the human-ities appeal to epistemological notions—such currents as post-modern-ism, relativism, social constructionism, feminism, and situated knowing. This course answers both developments. It introduces such disciplinary concerns as foundationalism, virtue epistemology, internalism and exter-nalism, naturalism, reliabilism, and the Gettier problem. It also engages such wider concerns as relativism about truth and reason and the role of social institutions and social structures, power and privilege, in consti-tuting knowledge. Philosophy164     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  331  Metaphysics   This course is a survey of some of the central is-sues in contemporary metaphysics, the area of philosophy devoted to understanding the fundamental level of reality.  Topics of the course may include existence and nonexistence, identity, personal identity, possibility and necessity, time and persistence, realism and antirealism, and free will.  Featured philosophers may include W.V.O. Quine, Saul Kripke, David Lewis, Judith Jarvis Thomson, and Derek Parfit.  Offered frequently.332  Philosophy of Science   This course consists of a philosophical examination of science. The course examines attempts to describe what is distinctive about science, including views concerning scientific methodology. The course also examines the character of scientific change, asking how one should understand the history of science. This examination leads to a discussion of the nature of scientific knowl-edge, including whether scientific entities should be considered real and what role values play in the development of science. Issues that arise from particular sciences also may be discussed. Prerequisite: one previous course in Philosophy or junior standing with a major in Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Natural Science, Physics, or Science, Technology, and Society. Offered frequently.333  Philosophy of Emotions   Anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust, surprise, envy, pride, jealousy, love, grief… without emotions our expe-rience of the world would be flat and grey, void of the upheavals, accel-erations, and turns that make the journey of life so exciting. But what are emotions? What kind of mental state are they? Are there universal emo-tions, or are all emotions culturally-relative? What does it mean to feel fear—as opposed to think—that something is scary? How can we know that someone is envious? Is disgust always bad? Can joy be inappropri-ate? In this course students explore these and many other questions concerning the metaphysics, epistemology, phenomenology, value, and rationality of emotions. Readings are drawn from a variety of sources: classical philosophical texts, contemporary articles in philosophy and psy-chology, popular culture, and literature.  Offered frequently.336  Philosophy of Language  Philosophers have long regarded lan-guage as the essential intermediary between thought and the world. Accordingly, this course studies philosophically important theories about language and more general philosophical conclusions drawn from con-siderations about language. Central topics concern meaning, reference, inference, existence, and truth. In addition to discursive language, some attention is devoted to systems of notation and of pictorial representa-tion. Offered occasionally.350 Metaethics  This course is concerned with the study of epistemo-logical, metaphysical, and psychological issues related to ethics. The course focuses on questions like the following: Are moral judgments objective or subjective? Are they relative to the speaker or to the com-munity of the speaker? Are there moral facts? If so, what kind of facts are they (e.g., natural, non-natural, psychological)? What motivates moral action (is it reason, desire, a combination)? What is the relationship be-tween freedom and moral responsibility? Readings are drawn primarily from contemporary authors. Offered frequently.353 Philosophy of Film and Performing Arts  This course surveys some of the fundamental philosophical questions that arise from the performing arts in general, and cinema in particular. What is a film? What does it have in common and how does it differ from other per-forming arts? How do these in turn differ from the other arts? What challenges do they pose to the traditional understanding of art? How do cinema and television differ? Other topics covered may include: the problem of identifying authorship in a collective enterprise such as a film or a theater production; the reasons and nature of our emotional engagement with movies or plays; the relation between film and soci-ety.  Offered frequently.360  Aesthetics  This course is a critical examination of the problems that arise in trying to understand the creation, nature, interpretation, evaluation, and appreciation of works of art. Art is viewed in its relation to other aspects of culture such as morality, economics, and ecology. A variety of classical and contemporary perspectives are examined. Offered occasionally.370  Social and Political Philosophy  This course explores some of the central questions in Social and Political Philosophy as well as some well-developed attempts to answer these questions:  What makes a government legitimate?  What should the goal of government be?  Is it to maximize justice, to maximize liberty, to provide common defense, or something else?  What is justice?  What is liberty?  Readings are drawn from prominent historical and contemporary thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Marx, Mill, Rawls, Nozick, Cohen, Okin. Offered occasionally.378  Philosophy of Law   This course is concerned with the nature of law and the relationship between law and morality. The course is cen-tered on questions like the following: What is the connection between law and morality? Is it morally wrong to break the law? Is breaking the law sometimes morally permissible or even morally required? Should morality be legally enforced? To what extent, if at all, should legal decisions be influenced by moral beliefs? What are the relationships between legal, constitutional, moral, and political rights? How can le-gal punishment be morally justified? While pursuing answers to these questions through the work of leading legal philosophers, students read a number of actual court cases and discuss specific issues like hate speech, homosexuality, and capital punishment, among others.

Science education for non-majors is provided through a number of courses that meet first-year seminar, Natural Scientific Approaches and Connections core requirements. The curriculum for majors covers modern biology from molecules and cells through organ-isms, populations, and ecosystems, and emphasizes the conceptual, historical, and technical progression of biological science. Specialization in specific areas of biology is made possible by offering a variety of ad-vanced elective courses. The Biology majors can be used as preparation for graduate school or professional careers in technical fields, the health sciences and education.The Biology Department promotes close contact between faculty and students through faculty-taught laboratories and a highly organized student/faculty research program. The department has well-equipped programs for faculty-directed student research in areas such as cell and molecular biology, physiology, ecology, and evolutionary biology. A unique program for the undergraduate is instruction in the techniques of electron and confocal microscopy and their application to biological problems. For marine and other animal studies, the department maintains a cooperative agreement with Pt. Defiance Zoo and Aquarium. The James R. Slater Museum of Natural History serves not only the students, faculty, and staff at the University of Puget Sound but also the entire Northwest re-gion as a resource for teaching and research. The curriculum offered in the Biology Department enables students to1. Acquire introductory and in-depth learning in the field of biology through classroom and laboratory exercises; 2. Develop intellectually through the practice of the following skills: Learning from oral presentations and reading; Communicating clearly and well both orally and in writing; Locating and analyzing scientific literature; Analyzing and solving problems; Engaging in scientific observation and experimentation in both the field and in the laboratory; Engaging in quantitative analysis, graphing of data and the use of statistics in data evaluation;3. Work comfortably with the extensive array of techniques and in-strumentation used in biological research;4. Collect, interpret, and present scientific data in written reports; 5. Understand the relevance of biology to contemporary issues and problems in society;6. Acquire a broad background in biology to provide a basis for sus-tained professional development. General Requirements for a Degree in Biology or Molecular and Cellular BiologyThe Biology and Molecular and Cellular Biology degrees offered at Puget Sound are based on similar principles. Both degrees are rooted in the fundamentals of living systems, their relationship to each other, their evo-lution, structure and function. Both degrees further emphasize the use of experimental approaches and the development of scientific writing skills. The Biology degree offers a broad approach to the living world stress-ing both molecular-cellular aspects and organismal-ecological aspects of life. In contrast, the Molecular and Cellular Biology degree emphasizes the molecular and genetic basis of organisms and the biochemical adap-tations and pathways that unify and distinguish them. In both degrees, students develop interdisciplinary skills in biology and chemistry.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     57BiologySound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

This course is designed to provide a general overview of natural history museum uses and practices. Natural history museums were the primary locus for biological research in the 18th and 19th centuries. They represent invaluable archives of Earth’s biodiversity; their vast collections of specimens provide a temporal and geographic record of life unmatched by written or illustrated accounts. They document variation—the foundation of evolution—in time and space and allow biologists to make comparisons that are difficult or impossible to ob-serve in the field. Natural history museums are an incredible resource for researchers with interests in evolution, ecology, zoology, botany and environmental change. They are phenomenal venues for teaching and engaging students ranging from young children to senior citizens. And they are sources of inspiration for scientists and artists. In this course students learn the history of natural history collections, engage in the practices of natural history museums, learn the myriad ways that natural specimens have been used in research, and do an independent project.

The faculty believes that students should cultivate knowledge of at least one foreign culture through its lan-guage as an essential part of a liberal arts education. The French Studies Department offers distinct majors that combine the study of language, culture and literature with international affairs, communications, music, theater and art, as well as a minor. The curriculum promotes oral and written fluency in French, and is designed to give students an in-depth familiarity with the language, culture, and literature of France and the French-speaking world. Faculty members in French Studies are special-ists in French literature and culture, and are either native to or have spent considerable time in France and Francophone countries.By assessment in oral fluency and written exams in all courses, graduat-ing majors in French Studies will: 1.  Demonstrate an ability to communicate orally and in writing in French, and be aware of appropriateness of communication with respect to situation and register. 2.  Acquire a broad appreciation and deep understanding of cultural UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     105French Studiesand linguistic differences in France and other French-speaking countries.3.  Read French texts critically and with aesthetic appreciation.4.  Write analytically and interpretively in French, and with knowledge of research protocols and general familiarity with French literary history. 5.  Cultivate awareness of important political and cultural issues in countries where French is spoken.French Theme Houses and the Michel Rocchi International DistrictThe department supports the learning concept of a living-learning resi-dential atmosphere and encourages students to participate in a living-lan-guage program. Students have the opportunity to live in university-owned houses on campus and communicate in French in a small group environ-ment. The International District located in Commencement Hall offers cultural programs and activities to students with varied international expe-riences and backgrounds.  Applications for the Michel Rocchi International District, and for language-based theme houses are available from the Office of Residence Life and on the department home page.Study Abroad CourseworkThe department of French Studies is fully committed to the concept of study abroad as a complement to students’ intellectual trajectory as they learn about the culture, history and literature of another country or countries. While all students are strongly encouraged to participate in endorsed study abroad programs in France or a Francophone country, majors in the department are required to complete a semester of study abroad in a French speaking country. Details of these and other study abroad Francophone programs may be obtained from department advi-sors and the Office of International Programs.Because not all study abroad programs are suited for French Studies majors and minors, only departmentally-sanctioned coursework earned through university study abroad programs may be counted towards de-grees in the department’s majors and minors.Credit is accepted from endorsed programs in Dijon, Nantes, and Paris. Programs are also offered in Francophone Africa. To ensure that credit will transfer, any student who plans to apply study abroad credit to a major or minor should consult with a department academic advisor prior to enrollment.Transfer of Units and PlacementStudents with previous high school French study may enroll in high-er-level language courses by estimating that three to four years of high school concentration are approximately equivalent to one year of college work in French. Other factors such as study abroad, living with exchange students or Francophone parents, and other intensive studies may warrant special consideration on a case-by-case basis. To assure proper placement, all students should consult department advisors in the French Studies Department prior to enrollment.All transfer students, especially those who have had prolonged peri-ods of time elapse since their last academic coursework, will be evaluat-ed on an individual basis. Their placement will be based on consultation and observation in courses at the Tacoma campus.Advanced Placement Examinations (AP) with scores of 4 or 5, or International Baccalaureate (IB) Higher Level Examinations with scores of 5, 6, or 7, apply toward majors or minors for a maximum of one unit at the 200 level. French coursework completed at other accredited institu-tions may be accepted toward the major or minor subject to the stated requirements for each major or minor.The university does not give credit for ACTFL exams nor does it ac-cept exams or courses taken via distance learning or hybrid methods toward the foreign language graduation requirement. Similarly, the de-partment does not apply courses taken via distance learning or hybrid methods towards the major or the minor in French.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Additional stipulations are indicated in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. A grade of C or higher must be earned in each course for a French Studies major or minor.Refer to home departments on prerequisites for all courses having other than the FREN designation.

PHILOSOPHYProfessor: William Beardsley (on leave fall 2018); Ariela TubertAssociate Professor: Shen-yi Liao (on leave spring 2019); Justin Tiehen, Chair Assistant Professor: Sara Protasi Visiting Assistant Professor: James GarrisonAbout the Department Philosophy is the systematic consideration of timeless and timely ques-tions of human concern. What is it to be human? What is real? How should we live? What can we know? Such timeless philosophical ques-tions have not only generated the academic disciplines that comprise a liberal arts education, but continue to interrogate and inform their intellec-tual foundations. How does race structure social reality? How does gender influence the transmission of knowledge? What is our moral responsibility toward future generations impacted by climate change? Could a machine think? Such timely philosophical questions apply the same systematicity to conditions that confront us today so that we can better understand what the world is, who we are, and what we should do.The timeless and timely questions of philosophy can be very roughly divided into two categories. Questions regarding knowledge and reality systematically consider the relation between ourselves and the world. Questions within value theory systematically consider what matters to us and how values inform our judgments, feelings, actions, and relation-ships. Finally, the study of history and traditions of philosophy reveals responses to these questions across cultures and eras. The pursuit of philosophy allows us to consider timeless and timely questions of human concern so that we can better provide answers to them for our place and our time.The Philosophy Department strives to introduce students to influ-ential historical and vibrant contemporary philosophical work. In so doing the Department stresses certain intellectual values traditionally associated with the discipline: breadth of outlook, rigorous argument, imagination, consistency, systematicity, and the dialectical interplay of different minds. It thereby contributes to the liberal arts education of all students taking its courses, helping students better understand how the world is, who they are, and what they should do. At the same time, it provides majors with the basis for graduate study in philosophy as well as related fields, such as linguistics, psychology, politics, and religion. The Department also provides its majors with a springboard for training in a variety of professional fields, such as law, bioethics, environmental policy, education, social work, technology, international affairs, and business.Students completing the major in Philosophy will have gained:1. The ability to carefully engage in close reading of demanding texts;2. The ability to produce precise and carefully structured writing, 3. The ability to participate extensively in reasoned discussion; 4. The ability to make cogent and carefully constructed oral presenta-tions;5. Familiarity with and an appreciation of a range of contemporary philosophical texts, theories and methods;6. Familiarity with and an appreciation of a range of texts and theories drawn from the history of philosophy;7. The ability to construct sustained arguments and analyze and criti-cize the arguments of others;8. The ability to develop and defend their own philosophical position and to engage in sustained and critical reflection on their own val-ues and beliefs;9. The ability to reflect meaningfully on themselves, others and the world. Students who major in the department’s program undertake, and suc-ceed in, a variety of endeavors upon graduating. Those who wish to do graduate work are well prepared for it. Others pursue professional pro-grams in such fields as law, education, media studies, business, public administration, divinity, and even medicine and public health. Without further education, many Philosophy graduates add their own energy and good sense to the abilities developed in them by the study of philoso-phy, and find rewarding positions in business, in the arts, in journalism, technology, and in government. Virtually any career that requires clear thinking, intellectual creativity, good command of language, and a per-spective on competing values and systems of belief provides opportuni-ties for a graduate in Philosophy. But equally important is the value of an education that develops a reflective understanding of ourselves, and of our experience of the world and of others.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

RogersAbout the DepartmentThe pioneer of the interdisciplinary approach, the field of classics en-compasses the languages, literature, philosophy, and history of the Mediterranean from the second millennium BC to the fifth century AD. The Classics Department presents as wide a range of courses as possi-ble in this diverse but fundamentally unified field.In each of the course offerings in the Classics Department students explore cultural phenomena that lie at the root of our own experience. Modern Western languages, literature, philosophy, and history have carried within them the deep grain of a classical past, which is at once surprisingly familiar and intriguingly alien. In courses in ancient history, culture, and literature based on texts in translation, students use a wide range of sources and methods to work towards an understanding of the ancient Mediterranean, both on its own terms and in its relation to later cultures.The Classics Department also offers courses in Latin and ancient Greek each year. Students learn the sounds and structures of the language and a basic reading vocabulary in introductory courses; in intermediate and advanced courses students develop their fluency and accuracy in reading and deepen their appreciation of style, rhetoric, and nuance. In all Latin and Greek courses, students also use the languages as a way of entering the heart of the vibrant world of classical antiquity. As an added bonus, students should gain from their study of either lan-guage valuable insights into the substance and structure of English and the modern European languages.Students who complete a major or minor in Classics will progres-sively build a more complex and comprehensive understanding of the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome by studying them from a variety of angles, and by bringing a growing body of knowledge to bear on their studies. Students who major in Classics learn to conduct research and to develop a sustained argument on a focused topic informed by a broad understanding of the field.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. Requirements for the MajorStudents considering applying to graduate school in Classics or a relat-ed field should consult with a member of the Classics faculty as soon as possible.

Students frequently remark that they have difficulty getting through the required reading in a course, that they have problems concentrating on the material, or that they cannot remember what they have read. They are expected to learn to read selectively but carefully, to identify passages that require close reading, and to search out the structure of a text. Furthermore, assigned reading is often a diverse collection of primary and secondary sources, rather than sections from one authoritative textbook. This course is designed to help students become more demanding and skillful readers, able to effectively navigate the demands of college reading. Students develop new techniques to improve their reading efficiency, both in terms of speed and comprehension. By making reading and studying into a con-scious activity, students are better able to extract information from a scholarly text, critically question the material they read, flexibly adjust School of Business and Leadership/Career Development/Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching68     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Center for Writing, Learning, and Teaching/Chemistryreading strategies according to the task, and vary their reading speed to enhance comprehension.

The department is approved by the American Chemical Society and offers degrees that are appropriate for students interested in careers in chemistry, medicine, dentistry, engineering, science teach-ing, or any other area where a scientific background would be valuable. Students are encouraged to consult with members of the department as they plan their undergraduate programs and to discuss career options in the sciences.The expertise of the chemistry faculty covers all five major chemical sub-disciplines: analytical chemistry, biochemistry, inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry. In addition to core courses in these major areas, faculty members teach upper-level courses on a variety of special topics including atmospheric chemistry, computational chemistry, materials chemistry, organic synthesis, and environmental chemistry. Faculty members are also engaged in a wide range of re-search projects and all students seeking the BS degree participate in this research and produce a thesis based on their work.In addition to being introduced to modern chemical knowledge and the role of chemistry in society, students in chemistry courses learn to think analytically and logically. As students move through upper-level courses, they develop the ability to critically assess work in the field and the atti-tude necessary to cope with the demands of independent inquiry. Students completing a chemistry degree are able to:1. rationalize and predict chemical behavior based on chemical princi-ples;2. apply laboratory methods to investigate chemical phenomena and synthesize compounds in a safe and environmentally responsible manner;3. operate modern analytical instruments and interpret the data ob-tained from these instruments;4. use computers for collection and analysis of chemical data and the modeling and visualization of chemical structures and properties; 5. communicate effectively in both written and oral forms typical of the chemical literature and professional conferences;6. search and use the chemical literature.General Requirements for degrees in Chemistry  and BiochemistryThe Chemistry and Biochemistry degrees offered at Puget Sound have much in common. Both are rooted in fundamentals of chemistry that include chemical thermodynamics and atomic structure, chemical analysis, organic chemistry, and laboratory techniques. Both degrees provide students the opportunity to study advanced topics in chemistry. The Biochemistry degree emphasizes the chemical basis of biological systems, with students developing skills in interdisciplinary inquiry that include cell biology, genetics, and biochemical laboratory techniques. In contrast, the Chemistry degree places more emphasis on advanced instrumental analysis, quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, and inorganic chemistry.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

Despite its omnipresence, race remains difficulty to discuss, if it is discussed at all, because of its theoretical complexity, contested social history, and emotional triggers. This course challenges students to engage in courageous conversations about the nature of race and its relations to mind, language, and aesthetics. Students will confront difficulty questions such as: What is race? How does race influence human cognition? How does race structure human communi-cation? How does race shape human aesthetic preferences and artistic endeavors? Students use tools developed in different areas of philoso-phy and its cognate disciplines to construct answers to these difficult questions about race. At the same time, students learn that these dif-ficult questions about race can challenge and extend common concep-tions of analytic philosophy. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity and Power graduation requirement. Offered frequently.390  Gender and Philosophy   This course is a study of a number of philosophical and political questions related to gender and with the relation between these two types of questions. The course will be concerned first, with metaphysical issues concerning gender: What is gender? How many genders are there? Is there an essence of woman-hood or manhood that goes beyond certain physical characteristics? Are ‘woman’ and ‘man’ purely natural categories or are they to some extent socially constructed? Is gender a social/political concept? Second, with epistemological issues that relate to gender difference: Do women, for example, see the world differently from men? What kind of implications PhilosophyUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     165does this have for scientific and philosophical knowledge? Are there, for example, specifically female ways of thinking or reasoning? If so, to what extent are they marginalized? Do gender related values or political aims affect scientific knowledge? Finally, with ethical issues related to gender: What is gender oppression? What is sexism and heterosexism? Granted that everyone has an equal right to flourishing regardless of gender, is a woman’s flourishing, for example, different from a man’s? Are there specifically gendered roles for men and women? To what ex-tent are we culturally biased when we think that women or those who don’t conform to gender norms living in other cultures are oppressed?  Crosslisted as "

The proseminar is open to all levels, but junior and senior majors and minors are especially encouraged to enroll in the course. Offered every semester. May be repeated for credit.200  Introduction to Classical Literature  This course is a true sur-vey—a dizzying whirl through first Greek, then Roman writings.  A cen-tral and unifying concern will be how the various works we read in part react to the earlier Homeric material as well as how they expand and/or contradict Homeric notions of heroism, right action, knowledge, poetic ambition, the roles of gods, women, and slaves, authority, justice, et cetera. Texts from the time of Homer to the late Roman Empire will be studied with an eye to how they echo and reshape the world of ideas within Homer’s Iliad to speak to their own time period. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.201  Ancient Tragedy   This course explores the nature and meaning of ancient Greek and Roman tragedy. It begins by examining the social, po-litical, and physical contexts in which tragedies were performed in clas-sical antiquity. Students then read and discuss select plays by the three great surviving tragic dramatists of fifth-century Athens (Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides) and the only surviving dramatist of Imperial Rome (Seneca). Attention is given to understanding how these plays might have been performed and interpreted within the Athenian and Roman cultures in which they were produced. Throughout the course students also discuss modern critical approaches to the plays and attempt to generate their own approaches. Thus this course aims to raise a greater understanding of both ancient drama in its historical context and its imaginative and transformative potential in the modern world. Satisfies the Artistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.209  History of the Ancient Near East   This course will study the growth and development of the ancient Near East with particular fo-cus on the two great cultural empires, Mesopotamia and Egypt, as the foundations of the ancient Mediterranean civilizations. The ancient Near East produced the oldest written texts in the world, and these provide a window into the ways of life, rituals, beliefs, hopes, and fears of people living 2,500 to 5,000  years ago. Students use these texts to explore some of the most fundamental transformations in human histo-ry: the emergence of cities, the invention of the state, the creation and destruction of empries, and, overlooking it all, the gods who brought hope and terror to the inhabitants of the ancient Near East. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement.210  Classical Mythology   This course explores myths and legends from classical antiquity and the light they cast on ancient conceptions of men and women, civilization, nature, and the divine. The embodiment UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     73Classicsof myths in ancient literature and art is the central focus of the course, as is the role of myth in Greek and Roman religious ritual and belief. The course also takes note of the subsequent life of Greek myths in Roman, medieval, Renaissance and modern literature, art, and society and examines some of the principal modern theoretical perspectives on myth in general and Greek myth in particular. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every other year.211  Greek History   This course makes an odyssey through Greek polit-ical, social, cultural, and economic history from the Bronze Age (c. 1200 BCE) to the death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE). The emphasis is less on the chronicle of events than on understanding the changing nature of Greek society during this period. Major topics to be explored include the development of the city-state as a political unit; notions of equality in ancient Greece; and the simultaneous flourishing of the arts and building of an empire at Athens under Pericles. Students learn to use both archaeological remains and literary texts, including histories and poetry, to reconstruct the nature of Greek society. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. 212  Roman History   How did a small farming village on the banks of the Tiber River become mistress of an empire stretching from Britain to Egypt? This course explores the political institutions, social structures, and cultural attitudes that enabled Rome to become the world’s only superpower at the time. One theme of the course is how that rise to power affected the lives of the Romans and how the Romans affected the lives of all those they encountered. Roman constitutional develop-ments, the religions of the Roman world, and the connection between Roman culture (including art, literature, and popular entertainment such as gladiatorial games) feature prominently among the topics covered. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. 231  Greek and Roman Epic  This course introduces the epic genre in Greece and Rome. The course concentrates on a selection of ancient epic poems including Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey and Vergil’s Aeneid. Students consider each epic as an individual cultural and artistic prod-uct, but also how later epics draw upon and respond to earlier ones. The gradually more complex understanding of the epic genre built into the class allows students to investigate how the Greek and Roman epics combine cosmology and human narratives in order to explore the place of human beings in the universe; the relationship between gods and mortals; and the connection between moral, social, or historical order and cosmological order. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core re-quirement. Offered every other year.280  The Archaeology of the Mediterranean World   This course in-troduces students to the field of classical archaeology, both describing “how to do” archaeology (that is, the techniques of locating, retrieving, and analyzing remains) and reflecting upon how the nature of these techniques influences our understanding of the past. Students discuss specific archaeological sites in their historical, social, anthropological, economic, religious, and architectural contexts. Students explore these sites not as monuments to be admired, but as a means to understand archaeology as a discipline. Attention is given to issues relevant to clas-sical archaeology today, including the looting of ancient sites, issues of cultural property, and ethics in archaeology. Students thus gain an appreciation of the complexities of present-day archaeological research and to both the benefits and limitations of the role of archaeology in creating our images of the past. Offered every other year.304  The Ancient Novel   This course explores the Greek and Roman ancestors of the modern novel. Ancient prose fiction opens many windows onto ancient attitudes towards gender, love and sexuality, religious belief and practice, and social relations. The ancient novels also happen to be fun to read, full of hairbreadth escapes, wide-ranging travel, intense and often conflicting emotions, complex and surprising events, and humor, sometimes delicate, sometimes shocking. Offered every third year.305  Race and Ethnicity in the Ancient World   Students in this course explore ancient Greek and Roman ideas about race and ethnicity and reflect upon how that thinking remains influential today. Students investigate how categories of race and ethnicity are presented in the literature of the Ancient Mediterranean through reading such authors as Homer, Herodotus, Aristotle, Vergil, Caeser, and Tacitus and through examining visual evidence. They study concepts such as racial formation and origin; ancient theories of ethnic superiority; and linguistic, religious, and cultural differentiation as a basis for ethnic differentiation. They also examine ancient racism as seen in such social processes as coloniza-tion, migration, assimilation, and imperialism. Students have to consider the impact of a number of divergent factors on conceptions of race and ethnicity, including: power (who defines the categories?); source (do all authors treat these terms the same way?); and context (in what ways do identities shift due to historical events and changing political or social contexts?).308  Ancient Cities   This course examines the history and architecture of the central institution of the Greco-Roman world, the city. The course focuses on the archaeological remains of cities throughout the ancient Mediterranean and addresses issues of the use of space in ancient town-planning and the political and ideological statements made by ur-ban art and architecture. In addition to tracing historical changes in urban development, major topics of study include the city as an institution, the effect of urbanization on the lives of the inhabitants, and the interpreta-tion of material remains. Offered every third year.309  The Roman Revolution   This course explores the period encom-passing the disintegration of the Republic and the emergence of autoc-racy in the Roman world (133 BCE – 14 CE). Students study some of the most powerful personalities of Roman history (Sulla, Caesar, Cicero, Antony, Augustus) and some of its most tumultuous events (civil war, rebellion, riot, reigns of terror, and assassination). Students not only acquire a solid understanding and knowledge of the narrative of the pe-riod but also become familiar with its basic controversies, including the relative importance of both individuals and groups in the breakdown of the Republic and the problem of consolidation and institutionalization of autocracy. Offered every third year.310  Theories of Myth   This course examines classical, world, and contemporary mythologies, with a particular emphasis on the history of theories used to study mythology. The course starts with Greco-Roman theories for analyzing classical myths, then analyzes in detail theories that have arisen since the end of the eighteenth century: comparative approaches, linguistics, psychology, structuralism, religion and ritual, class-, race-, and gender-based approaches. It is recommended that students have previously taken a course in myth or literary/gender theo-ry (e.g., "

Susan Owen Associate Professor: Bianca Wolf, Chair Assistant Professor: Nicholas Brody Visiting Assistant Professor: Sonia IvancicAbout the DepartmentStudents majoring in Communication Studies examine the human, social, political, institutional, and mediated dimensions of human communication practices and processes. In every course in the program, students learn how these communication practices and processes construct and recon-struct meanings, enable and constrain social interaction, and interact with institutional structures and cultural, historical, and political forces. Students choosing a major in Communication Studies develop analytic and interpre-tive skills that enhance their capacity for critical thinking, intellectual curi-osity about human communication, and proficiency in basic critical/inter-pretive and social science methods of communication research. Students demonstrate their command of this material by the capacity to (1) conduct critical inquiry and social scientific research, (2) locate and interpret prima-ry materials when formulating original conclusions, and (3) communicate the results of their research to diverse audiences, both orally and in writ-ing. The competencies emphasized within the Communication Studies program are integral to postgraduate study, a wide range of occupations, and the full and open discourse essential for democratic citizenship in the twenty-first century.In consultation with their advisor, students typically concentrate their major course work in one of four emphasis areas: Relational Studies (interpersonal, persuasion, health, technology), Rhetorical Studies (po-litical communication, argumentation, rhetorical theory and criticism, rhetoric and the law), Media Studies (television studies, film criticism, visual communication), and Organizational Communication. The depart-ment encourages students to complement their Communication Studies major with either a minor in a related discipline or a minimum of five courses in a supporting field, selected in consultation with their depart-ment advisor.Cocurricular ActivitiesThe Department of Communication Studies sponsors activities that include a competitive forensics program, including participation in policy and parliamentary debate within the Cross Examination Debate Association (CEDA), National Debate Tournament (NDT), National Parliamentary Tournament of Excellence (NPTE) and the National Parliamentary Debate Association (NPDA). The department also sponsors the Washington Alpha Chapter of Pi Kappa Delta, a national forensic honorary. Participation in these projects is open to all univer-sity students.

To that end, this course develops the skills of reason-giving and critical evaluation that are central to competent participation in a democratic society. In this course, students actively engage the formal structure of arguments. Students learn to evaluate the rhetorical claims of others while con-structing their own claims with reasoning adapted to the constraints of the situation. Students learn to question, analyze and critically engage the claims, grounds, warrants, evidence and reasoning of public dis-course and will grasp the major theoretical trends in the field of argu-mentation. While the course focuses on the major theoretical trends of argumentation, it does so through grounded topic areas to understand the relationship between theoria and praxis.

Offered every semester.240  Introduction to Communication Criticism   Academic communi-cation criticism (or critical inquiry) typically differs from popular forms of criticism in the amount of attention it devotes to descriptive analysis. Rigorous descriptive analysis is the foundation of critical inquiry in com-munication studies. This course introduces students to some of the ba-sic analytic concepts that communication critics employ to analyze film, prose discourse (essays, speeches), and visual images. Course con-cepts include media grammars and styles, figurative language and visual tropes, narrative forms, and genre. Throughout the course students will learn how to prepare close readings of multiple texts. Prerequisite: one unit selected from -199; may be taken concurrently. Offered every semester.252  Health Communication Campaigns   Health communication campaigns are coordinated, large-scale efforts to promote health and reduce health risks. Campaigns are traditionally rooted in 1) persuasive approaches which focus on altering attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors and 2) communicative approaches that evaluate multiple levels of commu-nication, different channels, and diverse communication technologies. This course introduces the historical perspectives of health campaigns, provides insights into various theories which inform campaign work, and reviews the methodological considerations of researching, implement-ing, and evaluating health campaigns. In this course students explore the design and analysis of health campaigns blending theory, practice and methods to critique past, present, and future campaigns. This course stresses practical application as students develop a hypotheti-cal health campaign by which they come to fully understand the ways that campaigns are planned, organized, executed, and evaluated. This course covers a wide range of theories and topics on health campaigns including but not limited to: Agenda Setting, Agenda Building, Uses and Effects, Cultivation, Parasocial Interaction, Edu-tainment, Social Marketing, Diffusion of Innovations, Health Belief Model, Social Norms, Stages of Change, and Knowledge Gap. Offered occasionally.291  Film Culture   This course uses film as its text to examine diverse and competing views of full and equal membership in human commu-nities, and the perceived worth of marginalized groups as members of those communities. Course materials examine the role of film and film genre in constructing and challenging cultural identity with special emphasis on race, gender, and sexuality. The course explores African American cinema and feminist film sensibilities in the context of histor-ical and contemporary film genre. The course examines the role of hu-man tragedy, comedy, film noir, and postmodern drama in the cinematic articulation of human identity and cultural values. The course is particu-larly focused upon tensions in cinema that address competing notions of “stable” and “fluid” human identity. The course offers students an opportunity to reflect upon a broad range of historical and contemporary film texts that address issues of cultural identity, belonging, and resis-tance in the human community. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Prerequisite: sophomore standing required. Offered frequently.292  Forensics   0.25 activity unit   Participating in intercollegiate foren-sics.

Students must prepare and submit a written summary of their research work for a final grade. Interested students should contact the department chair to see what research opportunities are available in a given semester. May be repeated for a maximum of one unit of credit. Prerequisite: one course selected from -199; completion or concurrent enrollment in "
COMM 240," and 330 or 331.308  Organizational Communication Theory  This course offers a focused review of organizational communication in terms of historical roots, metatheoretical commitments, conceptual and theoretical ap-proaches, and contemporary research. The first half of the course is devoted to a consideration of the organizational communication disci-pline in terms of history, metatheory and methodology, and important conceptual and theoretical approaches to understanding organizing and organizations. The second half of the course is devoted to discussions of a range of contemporary research on specific topics that are currently of interest to organizational communication scholars. Topics include, but are not limited to work-life balance, emotional labor, power, and resis-tance in organizations. Prerequisite:  or 373. Offered frequently.330  Quantitative Research Methods   The main goal of the course is to introduce students to the social scientific tradition of communication research. Over the course of the semester, students will be responsible for developing an interesting and novel research question and/or hypoth-esis based on scientific literature and communication theory. Students will learn how to critically evaluate empirical research and employ the scientific method to investigate issues and questions that arise within the study of human communication. Students will become familiar with survey research, experimentation, and techniques for data analysis. Prerequisite: Completion of or concurrent enrollment in  recommended. Offered every third year.344  Rhetorical Theory   Rhetorical Theory is an advanced course that examines the evolution of rhetorical theory during the past twenty-five hundred years and the cultural forces that have given rise to variations in the classical paradigm. Students of the language arts, classics, philoso-phy, as well as communication, should find the course a useful cognate in their academic programs. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing or permission of instructor;  recommended. Offered frequently.346  Rhetoric and the Law   For most of recorded history, the study of law and the study of rhetoric were linked. The professionalization and specialization of legal education in the late nineteenth and early twenti-eth centuries severed a connection that had persisted for two thousand years. Over the past few decades, rhetorical scholars in communication departments and scholars in other academic disciplines (including po-litical science, literary studies, and the law itself) have begun to forge a new link among the law, legal advocacy, and rhetoric, and this course introduces students to this relatively new interdisciplinary movement. The course concentrates on three intersecting themes: the law as language, the law as argument, and the law as constitutive rhetoric. Recommended: . Offered occasionally.347  Studies in Public DiscourseContemporary Public Discourse   This course analyzes the cre-ation, reception, and impact of American public discourse over the last five decades. Course material focuses on the process of rhetorical advocacy as it occurs in key political and cultural events and significant public controversies. Through detailed analysis of message construction, the course enhances students’ appreciation of the range of strategic choices available to public advocates, in-creases students’ understanding of the limitations and constraints that confront public advocates, and nurtures students’ ability to analyze and evaluate public discourse. Through the reconstruction and analysis of important episodes and controversies in recent American history (including decisions to drop the atomic bomb, the cold war, Vietnam, civil rights, and feminism), the course develops students’ knowledge of the role of public discourse in historical events and illustrates the relationship between rhetorical practice and American public culture. Recommended: previous work in rhe-torical studies (, 343 or 344). Offered every three years.African American Public Discourse   This course analyzes the tradition of African American public discourse from the late eigh-teenth to the early twenty-first centuries. Through detailed analysis of message construction, the course enhances students’ apprecia-tion of the range of strategic choices available to African American advocates, increases students’ understanding of the limitations on constraints that have confronted public advocates, and nurtures students’ capacity to analyze and evaluate various forms of public discourse. Course topics include: the emergence of an African American public voice in late eighteenth-century America (e.g. Benjamin Banneker, Absolom Jones), African American abolitionist voices (e.g. David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Henry Highland Garnet), the advocacy efforts of African American women (Maria W. Stewart, Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells), African American public discourse in the reconstruction and post-reconstruction era (e.g. Joseph Rainey, Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. DuBois), the twen-tieth-century civil rights movement (the Brown decision, Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, “black power” advocates), and various contemporary civic controversies (e.g. reparations, affirmative ac-tion). Recommended: previous work in rhetorical studies (, 343 or 344). Offered occasionally.348  Political Communication   This course examines the historical development of “the rhetorical presidency,” the genres of presiden-tial discourse, and the process of policy deliberation in the legislative branch. The course also explores the idea that political communication constructs or “frames” our culture’s “social reality” (our shared values, traditions, behavioral norms, etc.). The course prepares students to become more sophisticated and literate consumers of political commu-nication. Recommended: . Offered occasionally.350 Family Communication   Many orientations to the social world are formed from our experiences that extend from family identities; in particular, the ways individuals relate and communicate with oth-ers are profoundly affected by our familial relationships. Furthermore, understanding the family as a communication system is imperative in Communications StudiesUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     79an era when family issues are at the forefront of national concerns in governmental, educational, health, and religious arenas. This class re-gards the examination of “family” as fundamental to a comprehensive understanding of relational communication. This upper level course is intended to help students understand how communication helps people develop, maintain, enhance, or disturb family relationships. Students learn to think, write, and speak critically about what “family” means, and about the various forms, functions, and processes of family com-munication. This course is designed to help students better understand family communication in their own lives, both theoretically and practical-ly. Offered occasionally.351 The Dark Side of Interpersonal Communication  This is an ad-vanced relational course, ideal for students who have previous exposure to relational theory and constructs. This course introduces a variety of ‘dark side’ topics and issues that are often neglected as important phe-nomena in the scope of human relationships. The course includes a crit-ical examination of the ‘dark side’ of communication moving beyond the Pollyanna-like perspectives that pervade much of interpersonal commu-nicative research, (i.e., be attractive, open, honest, good-humored, etc.) in an attempt to achieve a more realistic and balanced view of human interaction. Offered occasionally.360  Contemporary Issues in Organizational Communication   Using a variety of different organizational lenses (i.e. culture, workgroup, and agent), students learn to think through issues in modern organizations. Course materials encourage students to take the role of organizational agents as they face ethical dilemmas in examining contemporary or-ganizational issues such as gender, language, class, and technology. Students can expect a variety of theory and application, integration through intensive class discussion, ethics case papers, and an in-depth group project, which includes a 40-minute professional presentation. Other assignments focus on developing writing skills that are appropri-ate for typical business and professional settings. The goal of the course is to encourage student reflection on how everyday communication (e.g. writing a simple memo) can affect and construct a system of interaction with profound organizational and social consequences. Prerequisite: junior standing or instructor permission. Offered every other year.361  Organizing Difference Using a variety of different organizational lenses (e.g. culture, workgroup, and agent), students learn to think through how social identity issues materialize in modern organizational policy and practice. Course materials encourage students to take the role of diverse organizational agents as they face ethical dilemmas in examining contemporary social identity issues such as gender, race, class, and age. Students can expect a variety of theory and application integration through intensive class discussion, reflective and analytic writing assignments and a final research project. The goal of the course is to encourage students to identify issues of organizational power and practices of oppression, particularly as these practices may result in disparate material consequences of economic health and well-being. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered occasionally.368  Environment and Organizational Practice   Since organizations cannot exist without communication and interaction, organizational life is filled with communication activities that intersect with personal boundaries.  Management and coordination, training, decision-making, and conflict are only a few examples. On another level, organizations are themselves the products of the constant processes of organizing. Thus, communication forms and maintains organizations by enabling the pro-cess of organizing. This course is designed to give students an intensive inquiry into systems theory as a way of understanding organizations as a function of communication and environment. Initially students review a variety of approaches which inform their understanding of organizational communication as it is practiced in the everyday life of organizations; however, the lion’s share of the semester is spent studying intersec-tions of communicating about and across systems and considering the impact of that communication on stakeholders.  The course closes by considering the very basis for which the use of systems theory began—to understand the relationship of organizations to the environment. Of course how people conceptualize what counts as environment changes over the years so in particular the course focuses on the impacts organi-zational practices impose on our natural environment and how manage-ment might change those practices to create a sustainable environment. Usually offered every other year.370  Communication and Diversity   The purpose of this course is to enhance students’ understanding of diversity issues as they relate to the study of communication. The course looks at how the media, its im-ages and discourses, shape one’s understanding of experiences, shape the experiences of women, and the experiences of people of color. The course also explores the ways in which elements of the media socially reproduce prejudice and foster resistance to prejudice. As a result of en-gagement in the course, students gain the ability to critically analyze and evaluate media products. They also become aware of critical profession-al issues in relation to a diversified workforce as it relates to the produc-tion, distribution, and consumption of media products. Cross-listed with .  Offered occasionally.373  Critical Cultural Theory   This course introduces students to the methodological and theoretical approaches of cultural studies and does so with attention to both the interrelationships of race, gender, and class as well as the contemporary politics of social justice. Although this course is, in general, not canonical in its orientation, the suggested read-ings do point students toward some key scholarship in cultural studies. Beyond seeing cultural studies, as traditionally viewed by academics, as developing out of Western academic critiques of culture and philos-ophy, this course examines the multiple locations, and politics of these Communications Studies80     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  locations, that gave rise to cultural studies. The course has many goals: to introduce the nascent field of cultural studies scholarship, to encour-age analysis of the “politics of location” of cultural studies research, to provide a broad understanding of the history of cultural studies, and to help students ground their own perspectives within an area of cultural studies scholarship with particular and particularistic assumptions, per-spectives, and approaches. Prerequisite: ;  and the conceptual issues introduced in "

Students will review current research that intersects interpersonal, family and health communication, considering its methodological, critical, and practical impli-cations. Students taking this course should be knowledgeable about rela-tional and health theories and research reviewed in other related courses. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.460  Technology, Organization, and Globalization   This course is one possible capstone of the organizational studies curriculum. Students consider how communication and collaboration technologies influence the creation, content, and pattern of knowledge networks within and between organizations. The course focuses special attention on recently emerging organizational forms including the virtual organization, the network organization, and the global organization. The remainder of the course examines how communication technology systems are chang-ing the very fabric of our work experience in the twenty-first century. Discussion focuses on the relationships between technologies and so-cial practices at the individual, group, organizational, interorganizational and global levels, as well as organizational and societal policy issues. Prerequisite: "
COMM 308,". Offered occasionally.461  Advanced Organizational Communication   This course is a capstone of the Organizational Studies Curriculum.

Prerequisite:  or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.482 Communication In Personal Relationships  This advanced course focuses on describing, explaining, and predicting communication pro-cesses that occur within the context of close relationships.  The field of personal relationships is interdisciplinary, with scholars from areas such as communication, family studies, and social psychology all contributing to knowledge about communication in relationships. Therefore, this course emphasizes communication but also includes concepts and the-ories from other fields. The overall goal of the class is to help students better understand some of the factors affecting relationships and to appreciate the impact of communication on their relationships in a vari-ety of contexts. Prerequisite: junior or senior standing or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.498  Internship Tutorial   Students who enroll in this course work with a faculty member in the Communication Studies department to develop an individualized learning plan that connects the actual internship site experience to study in the major.

The department believes that a student who spends four years wres-tling with economic issues and developing the analytical tools necessary to resolve them will emerge with sharpened reasoning and communication skills and will be more alert to the complexities of the world. The mission of the economics program is to educate undergraduates in the fundamental concepts and methods of economics and to help them become better informed and more productive citizens. Learning outcomes for students include the development of sufficient facility with the tools of economics to critically analyze private and public de-cision-making processes, contemporary and historical socioeconomic issues, and the fundamental role that economic forces play in society.The programs in economics are designed to provide students with a strong background in economic theory and applied analysis. The depart-ment offers majors leading to both the Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Arts degrees in economics, as well as a minor. The BA degree is de-signed for students seeking broad preparation in more than a single area and is often combined with second majors in international political econo-my, politics and government, or business. The BS degree is designed for students with strong quantitative skills or those with an interest in gradu-ate study in economics or applied mathematics. All economics students should: (1) develop sufficient facility with the tools of economics to be able to critically analyze private and public deci-sion-making processes and contemporary and historical socioeconomic issues, and (2) understand the fundamental role that economic forces play in society. Economics majors should demonstrate the ability to: (1) understand and manipulate complex economic models and draw meaningful connec-tions between these models and empirical applications; (2) conduct an empirical economic research project and convey the findings effectively, both orally and in writing;(3) develop the implications of alternative policy choices by application of microeconomics and macroeconomics; (4) un-derstand and critique recent economic research; (5) be aware of recent developments in the U.S. and world economy; and (6) acquire skills ap-propriate to their career goals.Economics majors should develop excellent communications skills, including the ability to communicate effectively both orally and in writ-ing. Using these skills, they should be competent to convey: (1) their understanding of the technical aspects of economics, (2) the results of empirical analysis and applied theory, and (3) their familiarity with eco-nomic events. In addition, economics majors planning to undertake graduate study should develop expertise in mathematics, mathematical economics, and econometrics. General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

Topics include work and family issues, the labor market, occupation-al segregation, and discrimination. Although the primary focus is on women in the U.S., this course devotes a substantial amount of time to issues related to women from other countries. Students gain an under-standing of what the economy and economic policy can do, how they can affect men and women differently, and how economic policy can lead to greater gender (in)equality.

The Gay Liberation Movement290 Making Men: Schools and Masculinities   0.25 unit  Schools teach students much more than academics. Schools also teach right from wrong, and they send messages about who students are and who they can be. This course examines the nature of schooling and the socializing power of schools, using masculinity as its lens. Through read-ings, writing, discussion, and time spent in schools, students examine the hidden and official curriculum schools use to teach about gender and what it means to be a man. Successful completion of this course requires a commitment to spend regular time in schools, participating in the formal curriculum, and observing the hidden curriculum. Offered every other year.292  Literacy in Schools: An Introduction   0.25 unit  Teaching stu-dents to read is a fundamental task of teachers in every class and grade level. This course examines the nature of reading and provides an intro-duction to well–balanced reading instruction in grades K–12. Through readings, writing, discussion, and time spent in schools, students are introduced to the nature of reading, how young people learn to read, and instruction that fosters lasting literacy. Successful completion of this course requires a commitment to spend regular time in schools, partici-pating in the teaching of reading or writing. Offered every other year. 294  Schools & Poverty  0.25 unit  Educating children living in poverty poses significant challenges to schools and teachers. This course is designed to allow individuals interested in schools to develop a greater understanding of poverty and to examine what teachers can do to pro-vide the best possible education for students experiencing poverty. This course examines and confronts the American stories of rugged individu-alism and of the United States as a place where class and race are irrele-vant, while maintaining a focus on what teachers can do for the children with whom they work and the society in which they live. Successful completion of this course requires a commitment to spend 14 hours outside of class interacting in educational settings with students living in poverty. Offered every other year.296  Using Children’s and Young Adult Literature to Teach for Social Justice  0.25 unit  Teaching reading has never been politically neutral because reading instruction, when it is done well, requires that we read something. Underlying this course is an assumption that the selection of what students read should consider the promotion of American ideals of liberty and justice for everyone. Together students think about the messages children’s and young adult books send and how to select books that promote social justice. Students read chil-dren’s and young adult books that include people from different racial groups, and books that open up ideas of gender and sexuality. Students consider how to best use such books with pre-college students Successful completion of this course requires a commitment to spend regular time working with youth. Offered every other year.298  Using Primary Sources to Teach for Social Justice 0.25 unit Teaching about the past tells us where we came from and provides a narrative that communicates who “we” are. Using primary sources with K-12 students is often touted as one of the best ways to shape inclusive narratives while developing reading, writing, and critical thinking. And yet, primary sources are rarely used at the pre-college level. This class is designed to introduce students to using primary documents to help K-12 students understand alternative perspectives of the past. While many perspectives are marginalized in K-12 classrooms, few experience the silence that surrounds LGBTQ people. By using the Archive of Sexuality and Gender, students learn about LGBTQ history and discover valuable primary sources for use with K-12 students, and create a plan for using these sources with K-12 students. Successful completion of this course requires a commitment to spend regular time working with youth in a volunteer setting. Offered every other year. 419  American Schools Inside and Out   This course focuses on the ways in which educators, politicians, and the public view the state of American schools. This course contrasts central issues of schooling as seen from the “outside” political domain and the “inside” experience of students. In particular, the course addresses how issues of race and social as well as economic inequality surround current debates over the best way to improve schools in the 21st century. This course is intended both for prospective teachers and for students interested in examining critically the policies that shape one of the key institutions in American society. Required for the Education Studies minor and for admission to 86     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Education/Englishthe MAT program. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power gradua-tion requirement. Offered each semester.420  Multiple Perspectives on Classroom Teaching and Learning   The central topic of this course is the ways teachers view learning, in-struction, classroom organization, and motivation. This course takes a micro-analytical approach focusing on classroom interactions and how a teacher plans for a range of student interests, experiences, strengths, and needs. Students in the course consider 1) how the teacher inquiry cycle of planning, teaching, and reflecting supports teacher identity development and improves instruction, and 2) how the interactions be-tween teachers and students, and amongst students, are located at the intersections of issues of knowledge, identity, and power. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity and Power graduation requirement. Offered each semester.493 Teacher Research Practicum  This is a required, school-based placement that students typically take in their senior year. Students are placed in classrooms with a teacher who is examining a “problem of practice”.  Students assist the teacher by gathering data related to the teacher’s question(s), analyzing the data, and presenting what they find to the teacher.  The School of Education builds off of decades of contacts with local districts to individually tailor placements.  Students meet on a regular basis to discuss their placements and their work in the schools. Offered spring term only. ENGINEERING, DUAL DEGREE PROGRAMDirector: Rand Worland, PhysicsAbout the Program To meet the educational needs of students interested in becoming engi-neers and who also want a significant liberal arts component to their edu-cation, the University of Puget Sound has responded with a Dual Degree Engineering Program. The program is administered by the Director of Dual Degree Engineering. Students in the program spend their first three or four years at Puget Sound taking a course of study prerequisite to engineering. Qualified students may then transfer to one of our affiliated institutions and complete an additional two years of study in professional engineering courses. Transfer to non-affiliated institutions is also possi-ble; however, those institutions treat the incoming student as a transfer student and impose their own additional graduation requirements. Upon successful completion of the required coursework at both institutions, the student receives two bachelor degrees, one from the University of Puget Sound for the core and major covered by our coursework, and the second from the Engineering School in the discipline covered by their coursework. Should the student not transfer at the end of three years, he or she may simply complete the Bachelor of Arts or Science degree in a selected discipline at the University of Puget Sound. Currently the University has entered into agreements with the engineering schools at Washington University (St. Louis), Columbia University, and the University of Southern California. Students should be aware that entrance to an engineering school for some institutions is on a competitive basis and requires a minimum GPA. Students interested in learning more about the program are invit-ed to contact Professor Rand Worland, the Dual Degree Engineering Director.To obtain a degree from the University of Puget Sound, the Dual Degree Engineering student must complete at least 16 units in residence and have credit for 24 units prior to transferring to an engineering school. These units must cover Puget Sound core requirements and the courses needed to fulfill the requirements of the student’s major. In order to meet the 32 units required for graduation, up to eight units of engineering credit are accepted as elective coursework towards the student’s degree at Puget Sound. Credits for core requirements may not be transferred back from the engineering school.In addition, to qualify for entry into an engineering school, the stu-dent must complete specific coursework that the engineering school requires. Most science majors fulfill much of this coursework in com-pleting a major at Puget Sound, and can do so within three years. Non-science majors can also participate in the program, but to complete the necessary coursework four years are needed. Whether they fall within the major or not, the student must complete the following:Chemistry*: 2 units 110 General Chemistry I, or 115 Integrated Chemical Principles and Analytical Chemistry I120 General Chemistry II, or 230 Integrated Chemical Principles and Analytical Chemistry IIComputer Science: 1 unit161  Introduction to Computer Science, or equivalentMathematics*: 5 units180/181 Calculus and Analytic Geometry I, II280 Multivariate Calculus290 Linear Algebra301 Differential EquationsPhysics: 2 units121/122 General University Physics I, IIRecommended for Biomechanical Engineering"

In addition to substantial courses in English, American, and Anglophone literatures, offerings include graphic novels, ecocriticism, Bollywood film, literacy studies, and medical discourse. English majors are not merely scholars and critics; they are producers and practitioners as well. Many students choose to complete a Focus in Creative Writing, honing their craft in small workshops, while analytical courses incorporate both traditional essays and creative or non-traditional assignments, often using digital tools.In addition to providing an enduring humanistic education, the pro-gram fosters the analytical skills, effective writing, and intellectual adaptability essential to students’ individual development, civic en-gagement, and personal and professional success beyond graduation. English majors complete the program skilled in the analysis and produc-tion of a variety of print, visual, and digital texts, and with the practical skills, critical consciousness, and creative insight necessary to face the pressing collective and individual challenges of our times. As a result, English graduates pursue a wide range of graduate programs and career paths, including law, publishing, business, education, communications, technology, government, philanthropy, and much more. As a comple-ment to study in English, the Department strongly urges its students to obtain speaking and writing competence in a foreign language. A student who successfully completes a major in English at the University of Puget Sound is prepared to1. Read perceptively and critically:a. recognize and characterize different literary and rhetorical stylesb. apprehend the relationships between aesthetic form and  contentc. pursue connections between texts and their political, social, and cultural contexts2. Write with clarity and sophistication:a. conduct scholarly research and write original, self-directed projects that integrate multiple texts b. analyze texts critically across genres and mediac. respond appropriately to the unique demands of different writ-ing situations3. Speak persuasively and from a position of knowledge:a. approach literature from perspectives of both craft and  analysisb. engage ethically with a diversity of perspectives c. present academic research orally and engage in relevant scholarly discussionThe English Department’s website (pugetsound.edu/english) includes more information about the curriculum, professors’ expertise and inter-ests, careers open to English majors, and our alumnae.General Requirements for the Major or Minor General university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

POLITICS AND GOVERNMENTProfessor: Karl Fields, William Haltom, Robin Jacobson, Chair, Alisa Kessel, Patrick O’Neil, David Sousa, Seth Weinberger Associate Professor: Lisa Ferrari Assistant Professor: Chris Kendall, Phibbs Professor of International RelationsAbout the DepartmentPolitics is about the struggle over power, authority, freedom, justice, security, and peace—the core issues of public life. The Department of Politics and Government trains students to understand these issues at the local, national, and international level, by providing a wide-ranging yet integrated study of politics and governance. In order to gain these understandings, the Department of Politics and Government provides a rigorous training in political issues, policies, and institutions as well as in research, analysis, and writing. The major emphasizes both cultivating an understanding of politics and developing skills that will enable stu-dents to become effective political and civic actors in their own right.Learning objectives and assessment• All P&G courses aim to enhance students’ substantive knowledge of politics, assessed in regular quizzes, examinations, and papers.  • All P&G courses aim to enhance students’ abilities to construct and articulate, orally and in writing, well-reasoned arguments ground-ed in evidence and texts. These abilities are assessed in regular examinations and papers, from students’ engagement in our small classes, and, in some courses, in formal oral presentations.    • The major aims to develop students’ abilities to conceive and execute  major research projects.  Students will frame questions, analyze data and arguments, and present their findings in a major paper as the capstone experience in the major. Alternatively, to assess the Department’s success in advancing students’ substan-tive knowledge of politics and their ability to construct and present well-reasoned arguments, the capstone experience may involve opportunities for students to lead seminar meetings centered on major texts in political science, and to articulate their knowledge of theory and substance in political science in an oral examination.   Given the diversity of topics within political science, the Department of Politics and Government is divided into four subfields. Students concen-trate in one of these subfields, allowing them to specialize while still pro-viding flexibility in their own intellectual pursuits. The subfields include: U.S. Politics: The study of domestic politics, political institutions and policyComparative Politics: The study of politics, political institutions and policies outside of the United StatesInternational Relations: The study of relations between countries and other global actorsPolitical Theory: The study of political norms, ideals, and conceptsWhile students concentrate in one of the four subfields, they are re-quired to take courses from outside their major concentration. In addi-tion, many department courses straddle more than one subfield, ensur-ing that each is part of a cohesive education in political science.Students majoring in Politics and Government are expected to mas-ter the tools of research and analysis. Politics and Government 200, a required course in the major, encourages students to understand the tools and methods used in political inquiry. Building upon these skills, students complete the major with a capstone research seminar. Some UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     171Politics and Governmentstudents will also choose to complete an optional thesis in the spring semester of their senior year. Many students also choose to do intern-ships, conduct independent research, and participate in study abroad programs in order to broaden their academic experience. The depart-ment can provide guidance as to which study abroad programs may best meet the needs of students as well as helping place students in internships in the local area, in Washington, D.C., or overseas, and as-sisting them in receiving credit for this work.The Department of Politics and Government provides its majors with information on a wide range of resources, including fellowship opportu-nities, summer programs, internships, alumni connections, employment and educational opportunities. These are maintained on the departmen-tal blog and website. After graduation, many majors pursue careers and advanced degrees  in political science, public policy, international devel-opment, diplomacy, business, and law.  The department faculty draws upon their experiences, as well as those of alumni, to guide Politics and Government majors, helping them to find and realize their goals, wher-ever those goals may take them. General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

The term “environment” is considered critically with recognition of the often blurry and even indistinguishable boundary between natural and human-built or managed environments. Environmental issues for study thus range from those related to non-human species and habitats to those concerning social and human health problems associated with population density and industrialization. While environmental issues reflect certain empirical realities about the physical world and its limits, they also engage contests among competing human values and visions for the future. Environmental issues are strategically defined, managed, promoted and challenged by a complex and often conflicting array of social actors. In a word, environmental problems are political. Students who major or minor in Environmental Policy and Decision Making 1) develop an understanding of the multiplicity of values, norms, interests, incentives, and scientific information that influence decisions on environmental issues, 2) learn to critically examine the social, politi-cal, and economic contexts for decisions on environmental issues, and 3) engage in interdisciplinary dialogue and apply systems thinking to address current and projected environmental problems. The program faculty believes that the study of environmental policy and decision making is best accomplished when carried on in conjunction English/Environmental Policy and Decision MakingUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     97with work in another major area of study. Students should consult with a second advisor familiar with the program.

The course examines foundational themes of Critical Theory as elaborated by Frankfurt School authors (Adorno, Horkheimer, Benjamin, and Marcuse) and study revolutionary move-ments and practices (Situationists, 1968, Autonomists, Tarnac 9, and Occupy) in relation to Marxist theory. Discussion and study also include more contemporary contributions to the question of the relation be-tween theory and revolutionary praxis in a world dominated and saturat-ed by capitalist culture by important Marxist writers, including Debord, Baudrillard, Badiou, Zizek, Holloway, and The Invisible Committee. Some familiarity with Marx and Marxian theory is recommended, but not required.

Satisfies the Artistic Approaches requirement; counts toward the “Global Middle Ages” and “Visual Culture” pathways; offered frequently.UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     135International Political Economy399 Library as Collaboratory   0.25 unit activity credit. Expressly de-signed as an experiential learning opportunity, this course invites stu-dents to dive into the workings of a 21st century library by undertaking, completing, and documenting a small library project. Specific project roles include: Metadata Creator, Exhibit Curator, Instructional Designer, Digital Publisher, and Transcriptionist/Historical Investigator. Along the way, students are asked to actively reflect on their educational experienc-es at the University of Puget Sound and to begin to articulate a growing repertoire of skills in critical thinking, communication, research, creative problem solving, and ethical decision making. Pass/fail grading only.400 Digital Methods in Humanities Scholarship  This course surveys a wide range of software tools and technologies that are becoming as-sociated with the domain of scholarly activity known as the digital hu-manities: micro- and macro-directed text analytics, annotated timelines, multimedia presentation platforms, data and network visualizations, NGrams, thick maps/GIS, topic modeling, immersive simulations, etc. During the first third of the course, students read conceptual material about digital methods and look at representative completed projects that have made use of such tools and methods. Each student then pro-poses a project that aligns with her or his research interests and selects a suite of tools appropriate for the project type. During the last two thirds of the course, students meet individually with the instructor at least once a week to review project status and plan ensuing phases of the work.  In the final weeks, students reconvene as a group to discuss their completed projects. The course is appropriate for students who want hands-on experience using tools and methods that are changing the way scholarship in the humanistic disciplines is being conducted. Offered frequently.INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMYProfessor: Bradford Dillman; Nick KontogeorgopoulosAssociate Professor: Emelie Kaye Peine, Pierre Ly, Director Visiting Assistant Professor: Jamila Glover, Lisa NunnAbout the ProgramThe International Political Economy (IPE) Program offers a multidis-ciplinary approach to the study of international and global issues. International Political Economy uses tools and methods of political science, economics, and sociology as informed by an understanding of history and tempered by appreciation of cultural differences.Students in the IPE program 1) gain an appreciation for competing theoretical perspectives; 2) study the overlapping economic, political, and social linkages between global actors and events; 3) master the application of this powerful framework to the analysis of a wide range of issues; 4) consider issues broadly and see how they are interconnect-ed; 5) engage in critical and creative thinking; and 6) develop expertise through senior thesis research on a particular IPE problem or issue.The program sponsors regular lectures and discussions on campus, which encourage students and faculty to consider the integrated charac-ter of global economic, political, and social issues. About the International Political Economy MajorThe International Political Economy major consists of a thoughtfully integrated set of courses in the social sciences leading to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in International Political Economy. The goal of this major is to prepare students for an increasingly interdependent world through the study of international and global issues. The IPE major cul-minates in a senior thesis in which students demonstrate their ability to analyze a complex question, bringing to bear both the depth of their knowledge and the breadth of their liberal arts education.Students who major in IPE take required courses in International Political Economy, Politics and Government, Economics, Sociology and Anthropology, and Mathematics. They tailor their plan of study to their indi-vidual educational goals by choosing additional elective courses. IPE majors are encouraged to pursue foreign travel-study opportunities as part of their undergraduate education. Two-thirds of IPE majors typically study abroad. Many students combine foreign study with background research for the senior thesis.Students who major in IPE thus combine broad, multidisciplinary studies of IPE, which examine global problems from a variety of per-spectives, with the opportunity to study intensely a specific issue in their senior thesis. The IPE major clearly embodies the spirit of liberal education as we understand it at the University of Puget Sound.Structure of the IPE MajorThe core of the IPE major consists of three required IPE classes (101, 301, and 401) and the three elective courses. The other IPE require-ments—in comparative politics, economics, sociology and anthropol-ogy, and statistics—provide necessary tools and skills and encourage the breadth of knowledge and sensitivity to differing viewpoints that are hallmarks of IPE at Puget Sound."
THTR 325,". Offered every third year.327  Advanced Fiction Writing   In this intensive fiction workshop students produce a portfolio of original fiction which undergoes many revisions, building upon techniques introduced in "
ENGL 228,", culminating in a substantial final portfolio of student work.  Readings in this course high-light the craft issues to be mastered by studying canonical and contem-porary poems, from Shakespeare to spoken word.  By revising multiple drafts of their poems, seminar participants develop the advanced skills needed to become more effective writers of poetry. The workshop format stresses writing as a process and includes weekly exercises, self-assessment essays, in-class discussions, and peer reviews. The workshop may conclude with a public reading of student work or other cumulative project. Prerequisite: 220 and 228; registration code required from the professor. Offered every semester.Studies in Genre330  Genre: Novel   This course explores the aesthetics and politics of the novel form. The course may focus on a particular national iteration or cultural tradition of the novel (e.g., British, American, Postcolonial), a specific formal approach or subgenre (detective fiction), or a historical or thematic subset of the genre (the rise of the novel, the sentimental novel, the roman à clef). In addition, the course may emphasize the theoretical underpinnings of the genre as a specific category of histori-cal production, engaging theories of the novel and issues raised by the novel’s formal and historical particularity. Themes and texts vary by in-structor; please see department website for current information. Recent topics include the following:Rise of the Novel in the U.S. This course investigates the relation-ship between the emergence and increasing significance of the novel and the development of the United States as a nation from the late-18th century through the mid-19th century and beyond. Beginning with a brief grounding in the precursors to and origins of the British novel, the course emphasizes works produced in the early United States and explores the form’s evolution into an influ-ential socio-political medium. The course addresses the novel’s formal development, its aesthetic divisions into subgenres like the sentimental and gothic forms, its self-conscious relationship to reality and the representation thereof, and its intentional interven-tion into the larger social and political questions that animated the American nation.331  Genre: Autobiography   This course examines the genre of auto-biography as it has evolved over time. Students consider how autobiog-raphies written at specific points in history relate to the social, political, and aesthetic trends of the period; how the “non-fictional” genre of autobiography may be distinguished from fictional forms such as the Bildungsroman; and what characterizes major subgenres such as spiritu-al autobiography, slave narrative, autoethnography, and memoir. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information.332  Genre: Poetry   This course provides advanced study of lyric, nar-rative, and dramatic poetry. Specific forms studied include the sonnet, ballad, villanelle, and other stanza-forms; the epic, ode, and elegy; and free verse. The course also involves the study of prosody and examines poems from different historical periods, nations, and cultures. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information.335  Genre: Drama   This course studies a selection of plays in light of the history and theory of the genre, the relationship between per-EnglishUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     91formance and text, cultural context, and literary scholarship. While the course may incorporate acting, dramaturgy, as well as the analysis of live or filmed performance, its emphasis is on how drama is and has been interpreted as a literary artifact. Through the careful study of lan-guage and form students develop the skills for analyzing drama chiefly in terms of its place in the discipline of English studies, without losing sight of the productive interaction between the literary and theatrical. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information.338  Genre: Popular Literature   This course focuses on one or more genres of popular writing. Examples include detective fiction, science fiction, fan fiction, westerns, romance novels, fantasy, or non-fiction. Students engage popular texts through rigorous literary analysis to pon-der how such “light entertainments” are inextricably linked to aesthetic, historical, and social circumstances. Possible topics include the rela-tionship between popular literature and ”the literary”; the relationship between popular literatures and their historical or cultural contexts; the ideological work of genre fiction; the possibilities, limitations, and per-meability of genres; as well as the politics of race, class, and/or gender in popular genres. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see de-partment website for current information.339  Genre: Print Media   This course explores diverse genres of print media and considers topics such as how facts are constructed in news reporting, how print and electronic media relate to each other, how eth-ical guidelines affect print media, how different publications represent similar events, and how social forces and journalistic writing shape each other. Readings include genre theory, journalistic writing in current print and electronic publications, and case studies involving ethics and repre-sentation. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information.340  Film Genres  This course explores some of the major theoretical and cinematic approaches to film genre, and provides the opportunity for students to produce a short film project based upon this exploration. The specific genre (e.g., documentary, horror, melodrama, film noir, etc.) under study for any given semester is at the discretion of the professor. Through the analysis and subsequent production of the selected film genre, students interrogate the ways that industrial, social, technologi-cal, and aesthetic factors shape the development, circulation, and recep-tion of a film genre over time. In addition to regular class time, evening film screenings are required. Cross-listed with "
ENLG 242," or 235 recommended. 363  African American Literature   This course considers African American literature in its aesthetic, cultural, historical, and political con-texts. Focusing on both the history of African American literary produc-tion and representations of African Americans in literature, this course addresses literary genres such as slave narratives and pivotal cultural movements as the Civil Rights Movement. The course examines the relationship among literary aesthetics, race/racialization, and social con-text selecting from a broad range of historical periods as the Antebellum era to the contemporary “post-racial” moment. Topics may include the Black Atlantic, Black Feminist Literature, and Neo-Slave Narratives. Satisfies an African American Studies requirement.364  Asian American Literature   This course explores important works of Asian American literature, including poetry, novels, nonfiction, and drama. This course considers Asian American literature’s historical emergence and relationship to canonical American Literature, attending to the way that literary form mediates authors’ responses to socio-historical circumstances like migrant labor, exclusion, immigration, forced internment, assimilation, and racialization. At the fore are theoretical questions about how these works engage and challenge notions of identity in light of pervasive social stereotypes and the ways the investments and injuries of identity inform the form and function of chosen works, even contesting the idea of an Asian American Literature. The course studies the work of such writers as Carlos Bulosan, Jessica Hagedorn, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Fae Myenne Ng, John Okada, Chang-Rae Lee, Sigrid Nunez, and Karen Tei Yamashita.365  Gender and Sexualities   This course explores the dynamics of gender, sexuality, and sexual identity as expressed in literature. Students explore literary texts that address the intellectual, social, cultural, political, and philosophical contexts from which gendered and sexual identities emerge and in which they are contested or negotiated. The course addresses some or all of the following topics in any given semester: sexual politics and power; the relation of imperialism and rac-ism to questions of gender; and the influence of gender on writing as an act of self-definition and political or social identification. The course may emphasize material from the historical literary tradition or contemporary authors. It may also address identities comparatively or focus on a spe-cific category of identity as it emerges or develops over time. Satisfies a Gender and Queer Studies elective. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information. Recent topics include the following:Sex/Gender in Early America   This course asks what forms and understandings of gender identity and/or sexual identities, masculine and feminine, were extant or emergent in the U.S. from colonial times to the mid-19th century. Students consider literary and histor-ical texts, as well as sermons, essays, and autobiography, as they provide insight into how early Americans constructed and negotiated their roles as sexed and gendered beings and how they produced spheres of influence as masculine and feminine. The course ad-dresses how literary and other works produced and enabled under-standings of personhood that were specific to the historical era, and considers as well how those definitions of sexual identity interacted with larger questions of politics, race, and nationhood.Early American Masculinities   This course considers the emergent and contested notions of manhood as it shaped and was shaped by the development of a national American identity. Focusing primarily on the revolutionary, early national, and antebellum eras, students read primary works that foreground masculinity as a category of be-ing—that is, as a subjectivity that facilitates and negotiates personal, national, political, sexual, and racial identities. The course attends specifically to the racialized and heteronormative functions of white manhood and to key figures such as William Apess and Frederick Douglass who challenged that narrow definition.366  Critical Whiteness Studies   This course engages with “white-ness” as a category of identification in order to develop a theoretically informed understanding of the history, function, and effects of racial en-coding within literature and upon the society it influences and reflects.  Course materials offer a corrective to the tradition of Anglo-American and European denial of dominant racial construction(s), and grapple with implications of rendering “whiteness” visible. EnglishUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     93Theoretical Perspectives370  History of Literary and Critical Theory   Ranging in breadth from antiquity to the present, this course familiarizes students with a tradition of writing about art and literature and debates about the meaning and meaningfulness of literature. Core concerns may include historically changing definitions of the literary, arguments about the value of art and literature, methodological approaches to the study or interpretation of texts, the relationship between art and culture or society, theories of language and representation, and the relationship between represen-tation and identity. These works address such fundamental questions as how and why do we read literature? How does literature work and what might it mean? And what is the connection between literature and the extant world? Because the field of criticism and theory is so broad and varied, particular emphases vary by instructor. Areas covered may include Classicism, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Hermeneutics, New Criticism, Reader-Response, Marxism, Psychoanalysis, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism, Cultural Criticism, New Historicism, Cognitive Theory, Speculative Realism, and Narrative Theory.371  History of the English Language   The aim of this course is to come to an understanding of our English-language ancestries and to develop a critical appreciation for the lexicons that we carry with us in every utterance or essay, text, or tweet. This offering is unlike other English courses, and in fact more closely resembles courses in history, foreign language, and science. Students examine the development of the English language from its Indo-European roots to the present day, gain the knowledge to approach pre-modern texts with confidence (including the rudiments of Old English and Middle English), develop sensitivity to the ways language functions and changes, and explore the current state of English as a world language.372  History of Rhetorical Theory   This course examines major con-cepts and theorists within the rhetorical tradition from  antiquity to the present. Issues central to the course include whether the goal of rheto-ric is necessarily persuasion, and whether the mode of presentation in speech or writing alters the meaning of rhetoric. Students explore the implications of rhetorical theory for daily life, particularly through the intersections of rhetorical theory and writing instruction, political and social activism, and visual media. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 373  Writing and Culture   This course investigates the enigmatic and shifting term “culture” by examining how writers, theorists, and artists express themselves when responding to a variety of circumstances, events, or existing forms of expression. Texts under study include liter-ature, journalism, critical theory, photography, and film, as well as the places that mediate these texts (bookstores, museums, cinema hous-es, the classroom, the Internet). In approaching culture through these different mediators and media, students also investigate strategies to express such encounters in their own writing.  Because this course requires students to experience culture in a hands-on way, attendance at a number of activities (including a museum visit and film viewing) is expected.374  Literature and the Environment   This course studies the devel-opment of environmental writing in English-language texts with an em-phasis on 20th- and 21st-century fiction, poetry, and memoir. Covering a wide range of geographical settings and literary genres, this course investigates each text as an argument for a particular “reading” of the environment and further considers the real-world consequences of that reading. Informed by recent ecocritical scholarship on topics rang-ing from animal studies to embodied nature to “Dark Ecology,” "
ENGL 374," explores works by authors such as Henry David Thoreau, Barbara Kingsolver, Octavia Butler, Gary Snyder, and Helon Habila as it considers the intersection of aesthetic practice and ethical intervention.375  Rhetoric of Literacy   Challenging the seemingly straightforward idea of literacy as the ability to read and write, this course asks what literacy means at particular social and political moments, emphasizing the ways these meanings are rhetorically constructed. Course readings include theoretical and critical readings from the New Literacy Studies, ethnographic and narrative accounts of literacy practices within specific cultures, and debates about literacy in the popular press.376  Narrative: Literature/Film    This course explores the nature, form, and function of a selection of narratives, reflecting on how a story unfolds depending upon the medium through which it is told. Drawing on theories of narratology, students consider the techniques that writers employ to convey their stories and, in turn, how filmmakers translate these techniques for cinema audiences. To facilitate this exploration, concentration is placed on the narrative mechanics that are unique to specific genres, auteurs, or movements. The particular approach will be determined by the professor; please check the department website for the most current information.377  The Book and the Marketplace   This course investigates the external forces that shape what authors write and how readers read. Rather than study the stories contained within the pages of a book, students concentrate their analyses on the economic and cultural in-fluences that affect the production and reception of books, whether the stories they tell are old or new, fiction or nonfiction, bestsellers or cult hits. Although there are opportunities in this course to study the internal mechanics of the books in question, such investigations serve and are subordinated to inquiries involving the culture of the book in the marketplace. Topics for such inquiries might include the history of the book, the publishing trade, the forms in which texts are transmitted, censorship, intellectual property, marketing and marketability, booklists and book clubs, professional and amateur reviews, and the politics of prize selection.378  Visual Rhetoric   This course investigates how texts might gener-ate and require a literacy that is visual before it is lexical. By tracing the relationship between words and images in a variety of genres including illustrated novels, photographic essays, comic books, film, and zines, students explore how images convey, argue, and narrate cultural, polit-ical, and personal stories. In addition to these primary texts, readings include seminal essays in semiotics and cultural studies that enable students to examine the distinctions between visual literacy and print literacy, the relationship between word and image, and what it means to be visually literate.379  Special Topics in Theory   Courses under this number may ex-plore either a single theory or small group of literary theories, as well as their application. As opposed to a broad survey of theory, this course aims to give students a deep knowledge of particular theoretical fields, resulting in conceptual and lexical fluency that will contribute to literary analysis across the curriculum. Authors, Movements, Eras381  Major Author(s)   This course number is reserved for the study of specific authors. Specific content, emphases, materials, and methods are determined by the instructor offering the course. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current informa-tion.  Recent topics include the following:Geoffrey Chaucer   This course introduces students to the major and minor poems of Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343-1400), including English94     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  his dream visions, Troilus and Criseyde, and The Canterbury Tales.  Students study the art of poetry as it developed in a manuscript culture (as opposed to a print culture) and learn to read Middle English.  Chaucer’s works are placed against the rich and complex backdrop of fourteenth-century war, politics, social struggle, and cultural development.William Shakespeare   This course explores the formal aspects of William Shakespeare’s (c. 1564–1616) language and the ways in which his drama engages cultural issues, conventions, and developments particular to his age, also known as the English Renaissance. Through the analysis of plays, cultural texts, critical readings, and film and live performance (depending on local offer-ings), students gain an appreciation for the ways these plays are shaped by 16th- and 17th-century debates about religion and court politics; conceptions of family, race, and gender; notions of authori-ty and the individual; the theatrical practices of London’s first public stages; and by subsequent cultures and stages, including our own. John Milton   This course studies the works of John Milton (1608-74) both biographically and historically, and situates the analysis of poetry and prose within the tumultuous religious and political contexts of 17th-century England, including Milton’s own radical views on Christianity, marriage, monarchy, and freedom of the press. Texts explored may include selections from his prose works, including Areopagitica, “The Second Defense of the English People,” and “Of Education,” while early works of poetry such as the Sonnets, “Lycidas,” and Comus provide the foundation for studying Milton’s epic, Paradise Lost.William Blake   This course studies the illustrated works of William Blake (1757-1827), British Romantic period poet, painter, engraver, philosopher, political radical, religious nonconformist, and visionary genius. Emphasis is primarily upon his illustrated poems and “mi-nor prophecies” of the 1790s whose interlocking aesthetic, politi-cal, and philosophical registers reveal the fascinating worlds Blake inhabits. These include the mysterious subculture of London ’s artisan class, a British nation at war with France and with itself over the political ideals advanced by the French Revolution, and the vi-sionary worlds of his “prophecies” where imaginative energy does battle with the forces of social injustice and intellectual oppression.Jane Austen   This course takes as its focus the novels of Jane Austen (1775-1817) and the social, political, literary, and domestic contexts that influenced her craft.  While recent cinematic and literary adaptations have promulgated the idea that Austen’s novels are easily digestible romances, her “home-bound” perspective on issues including marriage, dandyism, colonialism, healthcare, and class showcase an intricate discursive exchange between do-mestic and political spheres that demands engaged and nuanced reading.  In identifying how Austen’s novels showcase ambivalent movements between these spheres, students explore the unique and groundbreaking narrative stylings that have made Austen a cultural and literary touchstone.  This course satisfies an elective in Gender and Queer Studies.Herman Melville   While he is often designated America’s first world-class novelist, only Melville’s early novels won him much literary, popular, or financial success. His magnum opus, Moby Dick, sold fewer than 3,000 copies in his lifetime before disappear-ing from view, and he spent much of his time writing poetry that most of his contemporaries found at least somewhat unreadable. Melville (1819-1891) experienced and wrote about some of the most cataclysmic issues and fascinating chapters in U.S. history—slavery, the rise of industrial capitalism, American exploration and imperialism, waves of economic and cultural globalization, exotic paradises, the aesthetics and politics of sentimentalism and pop-ular culture, and, of course, the maritime and economic adventure of whaling. This course introduces students to a sampling of the finest and most compelling of Melville’s work, including, of course, Moby Dick, some of Melville’s best-known short fiction, his early “popular” works, and his poetry.Henry James   Henry James (1843 - 1916) is widely regarded as the master of American literary Realism.  The course examines thematic preoccupations of James’s oeuvre, for example, social subjectivity, “Americanness,” socio-economic class, sexuality, and gender. It also addresses developments in James’s narrative style, with attention to innovations that reflect and respond to the author’s commitment to English letters as much as his interests in companion fields like philosophy, psychology, and biology. As stu-dents gain familiarity with James’s major and minor works of litera-ture and criticism, they develop a framework for understanding his cultural impact and ongoing significance.James Joyce This course explores all of Joyce’s major texts, beginning with the “scrupulous meanness” of his short story collection Dubliners (1914), working through his Künstlerroman A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), studying in depth his masterpiece Ulysses (1922), and dipping its toes into the waters of the Liffey with a selection from Finnegans Wake (1939).  Along the way, the course will consider portions of lesser-taught texts such the poetry collections Chamber Mu-sic (1907) and Pomes Pennyeach (1927), as well as Joyce’s only play, Exiles (1918).  The reading of Joyce’s texts will be enriched by engagement with his-torical and aesthetic contexts, and it will also be illuminated by the reading of theoretical texts drawn from gender studies, postcolo-nial studies, queer theory, and ecocriticism.382  Movements   Courses under this category organize texts into the study of particular and discrete movements. These movements may be defined literarily, historically, politically, or culturally, among other possible groupings. The course may focus on self-defined literary move-ments or movements that have been defined retrospectively. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information. Recent topics include the following:Irish Literary Revival   The period in Ireland from the late 19th through the early 20th century saw the creation of a remarkable body of literature that shaped both the island’s politics and its sense of national identity.  This course explores Irish literary and cultural history from the Fenian uprisings in 1867 to Irish neutrality in World War II, with particularly emphasis on the armed rebellion against Britain between 1916 and 1921.  Students examine the development of Irish literature written in English during this period through the study of poetry, drama, fiction, and nonfiction.  Course material considers a wide range of writers, but particular emphasis is given to J. M. Synge, Lady Augusta Gregory, W. B. Yeats, Sean O’Casey, and James Joyce,383  Eras   This category designates courses that organize the study of literature into discrete historical eras and their significant cultural, aes-thetic, or political concerns.  “Eras” courses differ from historical sur-veys in that they focus on a single historical period, rather than bridge multiple historical periods, thus emphasizing depth within the period EnglishUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     95over breadth encompassing multiple periods. The emphasis on literary texts is balanced with attention to secondary sources and literary schol-arship. The course also includes perfecting methods of literary analysis, instruction on writing about literature, and challenging writing assign-ments. Specific themes, authors, and texts vary by semester; please see department website for current information. Themes and texts vary by instructor; please see department website for current information.  Recent topics include the following:Studies in Medieval Literature   The course explores medieval literary genres and writers in a historical context, situating the production of literature in a manuscript culture, asking students to explore the politics of literacy, writing, and audience. This course necessarily negotiates the idea of shifting epistemologies and cul-tural values. Cultural constructs explored include the idea of courtly love, individualism, gender, authorship, mystical experience, and the conflicting worldviews of paganism and Christianity. Students are asked to engage these issues in seminar discussion, direct dis-cussion, write abstracts, produce a contextual study on the writer of their choice. Authors studied may include Chaucer, Langland, the Pearl Poet, Julian of Norwich, Christine de Pizan, Marie de France.Studies in Sixteenth-Century British Literature   The course addresses the work of English writers of the 16th century, espe-cially More, the Sidneys, Spenser, Marlowe, and Shakespeare. At different times it focuses on such issues as the consequences of the introduction of the printing press; the status of the poet and the courtier; writing by women; the cult of love and the develop-ment of the sonnet; the literature of the “Renaissance” of Humane Learning and the Reformation of the Church; the Bible in English; politics in the Elizabethan drama and epic; and competing styles of comedy and tragedy on the stage. Studies in Seventeenth-Century British Literature   This course examines British literature of the “early” 17th century (1603-1660), from the death of Queen Elizabeth to the restoration of the monar-chy under Charles II. The period is marked by severe political and religious conflicts that led to the Civil War (1642-51), daring experi-ments in representative government, colonization of the Americas, and new conceptual systems for understanding humankind’s place in the universe. The course examines how writers of the period (for example, Bacon, Donne, Wroth, Herbert, Hobbes, Browne, Milton, Marvell, Dryden, Behn, Bunyan, Newton, and Locke) responded to such issues as the cultures of the court and the town, the repre-sentation of authority in religion, politics, and art, the development of Baroque and Classical styles, the emergence of “modern” per-spectives in the physical sciences, and the political concept of the individual. The kinds of literature under investigation may include the letters, tracts, and pamphlets of Anglicans, Catholics, Puritans, and Quakers, writings by women, Metaphysical and Cavalier poet-ry, Jacobean and Restoration drama, and the Miltonic epic.Studies in Eighteenth-Century British Literature   This course ex-amines British literature from the “long” 18th century (1660-1800). The course focuses on poetry, drama, and/or prose in the context of literary, cultural, philosophical, scientific, social, economic, or political movements of the period. Subjects to be investigated may include Restoration literature, the Enlightenment, Neoclassicism, Sensibility, Early Romanticism, empire, or revolution. Authors studied may include John Dryden, William Congreve, John Wilmot, Aphra Behn, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe, Joseph Addison, Alexander Pope, Samuel Richardson, Eliza Haywood, Henry Fielding, Samuel Johnson, Fanny Burney, James Thomson, Thomas Gray, Oliver Goldsmith, William Cowper, and Anna Laetitia Barbauld.Studies in Nineteenth-Century British Literature   This course considers late 18th- and 19th-century British literature, the Age of Sensibility through Romanticism to Victorianism. In one iteration, the course may focus on the Gothic novel, the sentimental novel, the revolution in English poetry during the Regency, and the tran-sition to Victorianism in the early years of the reign of George IV. Another may emphasize ideas of Englishness and of empire during the Victorian era. Radcliffe, Edgeworth, Austen, Scott, Wordsworth, Keats, Byron, Peacock, Gaskell, Hardy, Dickens, Collins, and Carlyle are among the writers that the course may study. Studies in Twentieth- and Twenty-first-Century British Literature   A study of important British and Commonwealth literary artists from 1900 through the present. Students study a range of critical method-ologies that help them explore canonical and non-canonical works. Among the topics to be investigated are emerging themes of aes-theticism, futurism, feminism, socialism, and postcolonialism. The course also includes an examination of important literary periods and movements—including Edwardianism, modernism, and postmod-ernism—through the works of major writers of the period.  Authors to be studied may include H. G. Wells, Rebecca West, James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, Stevie Smith, Philip Larkin, Sam Selvon, Salman Rushdie, and Zadie Smith. Studies in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century American Literature   This course considers early American literature from the 17th and/or 18th centuries.

Situating contemporary U.S. literature in the aesthetic, historical, and cultural contexts pertinent to its creation, the course may emphasize any number of issues, among which might be canon debates, postmodernism, the rela-tion of history and literature, the politics or history of literary form, the increasing prominence of literature by women and writers of color (e.g. feminist, black nationalist, Chicano/a, Asian American, Native American, and gay and lesbian), the institutional conditions of literary production, or other developments of cultural importance (such as environmentalism, digital media, and post-industrialism, to name a few). By situating the movements in broader contexts, the course considers whether contemporary literature requires new categories of analysis. Genre emphasis (e.g. poetry, fiction, drama) is at the discretion of the instructor, and different iterations of the course will focus on different genres and/or media. Authors studied may include Junot Diaz, Jorge Anaya, Colson Whitehead, Victor LaValle, Don DeLillo, Joan Didion, Robert Stone, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Gayl Jones, Octavia Butler, Philip Roth, Randall Kenan, Philip Levine, Ai, Joy Harjo, and Cathy Park Hong.Senior SeminarsThe senior seminars are designed to facilitate advanced study and the production of substantial work on topics related to the student’s inter-est. Please consult the English department website to determine the specific topics offered in a given semester. All senior seminars must be completed on the Puget Sound campus. Senior seminars are offered both for students pursuing an analytical or scholarly project and those pursuing a substantial project in creative writing.Seminars in literary scholarship or cultural and rhetorical analysis in-volve students in an in-depth examination of a specific topic, and guide them in crafting a scholarly project that engages the critical literature on that topic. The early part of the semester emphasizes building a shared base of knowledge that will inform the independent projects, while the latter part emphasizes independent research, and the production of a substantial piece of scholarly analysis.The creative writing senior seminars facilitate the writing and revision of an original work: a collection of short stories, a novel or novella, a chapbook or volume of poems, a play, a film script, or other substantial piece of student writing. Like the literary scholarship seminars, the cre-ative writing seminars devote the early part of the semester to building a shared expertise that will inform creative projects in multiple genres; the latter part of the semester the production of a polished manuscript.The Writing Internship has two components, fieldwork and class-work. Students work as writing interns in advertising, public relations, journalism, television, and other areas. The classroom component is conducted as a senior seminar in which students make presentations on a variety of topics, discuss internship experiences, and receive informa-tion on career and professional development.431  Senior Seminar: American Literature   An advanced seminar.

A GIS is effective in supporting work across the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.  Specific applications include environmental sciences, public health, urban planning, conservation biol-ogy, geology, digital humanities, military and education, and continues to increase as technology advances. This course is designed for students who have little or no experience with GIS and want to gain an under-standing of the technology.  In this course, students gain a deeper under-standing of the core concepts of the field and learn how to apply them in specialized areas of study.  This course will use ArcGIS for Desktop software and include an introduction to ArcGIS Online tools to support project-based exercises in a hands-on lab environment.  No previous ex-perience with GIS is required.310  Environmental Decision Making   This course focuses on the de-cision making processes that shape the implementation of environmen-tal policy in the United States. Environmental decisions are no longer the exclusive province of technical experts employed by government bureaucracies. Pioneering efforts to involve groups of environmental stakeholders (such as environmental groups, property owners, business interests, tribes, and officials at all levels of government) in environmen-tal decision making began 30 years ago. Now environmental decisions are often held to a legal and public expectation that deliberations will be public and participatory. Students in this course will develop an un-derstanding of the institutions shaping these decisions, the theory be-hind various decision making approaches, the relative effectiveness of different approaches, and the skills needed to make decisions in these complex policy contexts. This class includes group work on case-based projects and policy simulations. Offered occasionally.315  Energy Resources   This course surveys the wide range of modern energy sources, and considers the prospects for their future supply and availability. Each energy source is explored from a wide range of perspectives, including: its origin, geographic distribution, energy den-sity, energy “type” (gravity, chemical, radioactive, solar), processing, refining, or transformation from one form of mass or energy to another, Environmental Policy and Decision MakingUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     99transport (both pre- and post- processing/transformation), environmental costs (upstream and downstream-lifecycle considerations), and eco-nomic costs (cost/unit of energy produced). As ongoing events dictate, energy topics in the news are also considered, including economic, po-litical, and environmental issues of the day. Prerequisites: one course in the Natural Scientific Approaches core, one course in the Mathematical Approaches core, and /200 or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.322  Water Policy   This course focuses on the management of water resources. More specifically, it addresses the tensions and interactions between hydrological principles, economics, and politics during water management decision making processes. This course challenges stu-dents to develop an understanding of the interrelationship between different disciplinary fields of knowledge, including those in the physical and social sciences. Students learn about a wide variety of natural pro-cesses that determine the distribution and quality of the world’s fresh-water resources. Students also learn about the many ways that fresh-water resources are affected by human activities at a global, national and local scale. Prerequisite: /200 or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.324  Biogeochemical Approaches to Environmental Science   This course provides an introduction to biogeochemical methods used in the study of environmental science. The course focuses on isotopic and ele-mental analyses of geological and biological materials with applications to a range of questions. Examples of topics include; energy flow, nutri-ent cycling, animal migration, and paleoclimatic conditions. The course readings draw heavily upon case studies from the primary scientific lit-erature. Cross-listed as /200 or a PG course. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 327  Climate Change: Economics, Policy, and Politics    Global climate change is considered by many to be the most significant environmental challenge of the 21st century.  Unchecked, the continued accumulation of greenhouse gases over this century is projected to eventually warm the planet by about 6 to 14°F, with associated impacts on the environ-ment, economy, and society.  This course explores the economic char-acteristics of the climate change problem, assesses national and interna-tional policy design and implementation issues, and provides a survey of the economic tools necessary to evaluate climate change policies.  It is largely discussion-oriented and thus requires a high degree of participa-tion by students in the classroom. Prerequisite: . Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. 345  Community-Based Methods for Environmental Research   Investigating issues related to environmental policy and decision-mak-ing requires a varied toolkit of interdisciplinary research and analysis methodologies that can be applied at the community level. This course introduces students to major social science methodologies and explores their applicability for EPDM research, including: historical and archival research, folkloric and narrative analysis, community based participatory research, and cultural geography.  Each student designs and implements their own community-based field research project, making use of at least two of the methods introduced in the course. Prerequsite: /200 or a PG course or instructor per-mission. 395  The History, Utility, and Practices of Natural History Museums   0.5 unit  This course is designed to provide a general overview of natural history museum uses and practices. Natural history museums were the primary locus for biological research in the 18th and 19th centuries. Environmental Policy and Decision MakingUNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     101They represent invaluable archives of Earth’s biodiversity; their vast col-lections of specimens provide a temporal and geographic record of life unmatched by written or illustrated accounts. They document variation–the foundation of evolution–in time and space and allow biologists to make comparisons that are difficult or impossible to observe in the field. Natural museums are an incredible resource for researchers with inter-ests in evolution, ecology, zoology, botany and environmental change. They are phenomenal venues for teaching and engaging students rang-ing from young children to senior citizens. And they are sources of inspi-ration for scientists and artists. In this course students learn the history of natural history collections, engage in the practices of natural history museums, learn the myriad ways that natural specimens have been used in research, and do an independent project. Offered occasionally.400 Senior Seminar in Environmental Studies  This course analyzes one current environmental issue from the perspectives of the sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities. Students collectively examine the case from different disciplinary perspectives in an attempt to un-derstand issues in their full complexity. Students conduct an in-depth research project on issues and present their findings in an open forum. Students formulate their own problem-solving approach to environmen-tal problems and recognize how their approach connects to the work of others. Prerequisites: Environmental Policy and Decision Making major or minor; /200; two elective units including one policy elec-tive; and senior standing. Offered fall term only.495/496 Independent Study498  Internship Tutorial   Internship placement related to environmen-tal policy and decision making, in areas such as urban planning, nature mapping, and stakeholder analysis. Students who enroll in this course work with a faculty member to develop an individualized learning plan that connects the internship experience to the Environmental Policy and Decision Making minor. Prerequisite: approval of tutorial professor and the Internship Coordinator.EXERCISE SCIENCEProfessor: Gary McCall, Chair; Barbara WarrenAssociate Professor: Jung Kim (on leave fall 2018)Assistant Professor: Michael PohlAbout the Department The mission of the Exercise Science Department is to provide a scien-tific background which promotes critical thinking as it relates to health, wellness and the attainment of human potential.

Apply cognitive learning in an off-campus work-related organiza-tional setting.2. Extend knowledge acquired elsewhere in the curriculum.3. Reflect upon work experience within an academic context.EligibilityThe eligibility of a student to undertake an internship is determined by the Career and Employment Services using the following criteria:1. Sophomore, junior or senior class standing.2. Cumulative university grade point average of at least 2.50.3. A declared major or minor in a department, school, or program; or other academic preparation appropriate for the internship place-ment.4. Recommendation of the academic advisor.5. Approval from the chair or director of the department, school, or program for which the student will receive credit (if a faculty-spon-sored internship).RequirementsThe requirements of the internship will be specified in the Internship Learning Agreement composed of an Academic Syllabus and an Internship Description. The Learning Agreement must be completed; signed by the intern, the supervising instructor, the department chair or program director (for a faculty-sponsored internship), and the intern-ship supervisor; and submitted to Career and Employment Services before the end of the add period during the term of enrollment. The student may then be registered for credit.The Academic Syllabus (see Note below) should be comparable to  the syllabus of any upper-division course in the curriculum and should include:1. A list of the academic topics or questions to be addressed. 2. The learning objectives to be achieved.3. The reading and/or research requirements relevant to the topics and learning objectives.4. The assignments or progress reports (plus the dates they are due to the instructor) to be completed during the internship.5. The final project, paper, report, or thesis to be completed at the conclusion of the internship.6. A regular schedule of days and meeting times of at least 35 hours for the internship seminar. Or, a comparable schedule of at least 35 hours for consultation with the instructor and independent research in a faculty-sponsored internship. In either case, students should regularly review their progress toward their learning objectives and should discuss how they are applying their previous courses and experiences to the internship. 7. The date during the final examination period (or the date by the last day of the summer session) for the student to submit the self-as-sessment to the instructor unless arrangements have been made to extend the internship with an in-progress grade beyond the nor-mal end of the term.8. The instructor’s grading criteria.NoteA student in an internship seminar will also have a seminar syllabus from the seminar instructor. The student should not duplicate the seminar syl-labus in the Learning Agreement Academic Syllabus but must address those items specific to the student’s particular internship.The Internship Description will include: 1. A list of the specific responsibilities and tasks relevant to the aca-demic learning objectives.2. A list of the specific responsibilities and tasks relevant to the intern-ship site expectations although not directly related to the academic learning objectives.3.

IPE 407," Political Ecology.  416  Modern India and Diaspora   This course is designed with a two-fold focus: 1) to provide an in-depth sociological examination of perti-nent developments and trends shaping modern/contemporary India; and 2) to situate India’s trajectory as a modern society in a broader interna-tional (both regional and global) context. Specifically, the course centers on the (a) critical social transformations in Indian society since the begin-ning of the 20th century; and (b) an examination of India’s relationships and links to the broader global community. The 20th century marks a period of “great transformations” in the narrative of India. Its salience is reflected in the fact that the period draws on the intersection of the late colonial as well as the post-colonial period in India. The course empha-sizes the complex links and transition between British colonialism and the post-colonial period in India, and India’s relationship with the global system. Offered occasionally.420  Sociology through Literature   Sociology has long sought scien-tific status. In the process, it has tended to squeeze out the human and personal from its vocabulary and methods. This course is designed to tackle the crucial questions of sociology by approaching them through an examination of works of literature (for novelists are often excellent microsociologists) and through personal social histories to try and arrive at the abstract and theoretical aspects of sociology from the personal and concrete. The unifying theme of the course is emancipation. This course is conducted in seminar format requiring extensive class partici-pation. 481  Special Topics   This seminar involves an in-depth examination of selected topics in anthropology and/or sociology. A different topic is selected by faculty each time it is offered. Relevant theory and current research are examined. Students are responsible for research papers and presentations under close supervision of the faculty. May be repeat-ed for credit. Offered occasionally.490  Senior Thesis   In this capstone course students bring together their previous conceptual, theoretical, and empirical knowledge and skills in sociology and anthropology in order to propose and ultimately answer a social-scientific research question. Much of the work is done independently while under the supervision of the thesis instructor. Prerequisites: "

The course combines nearly 24 hours of class and field experience over the course of a single weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening) with additional meeting hours during three weeknight meetings. Students study a single re-gional watershed from source to mouth, gaining an understanding of the role citizens play in shaping the environmental policy of a particular place. The class employs written case materials developed to highlight particularly successful examples of citizen engagement in environmen-tal policy in the watershed, mini-lectures by academic experts on the relevant political and environmental contexts of the cases, discussion panels with key stakeholders and decision makers on these issues, and field experiences designed to reveal the applied context of the issues under consideration. A select number of local community members may participate in the class on a non-credit basis.  351  Puget Sound Environmental Issues Part II: Laws and Land Use Designations   0.25 unit  This course is designed to familiarize students with environmental laws and land use designations governing selected environmental issues central to the health of Puget Sound. The course combines nearly 24 hours of class and field experience over the course of a single weekend with additional meeting hours during three week-night meetings. Students study a single regional watershed from source to mouth to gain a place-based appreciation for the effects of laws and land use designations on the environment. The class employs written case materials developed to highlight particular environmental issues in the watershed, mini-lectures by academic experts on the relevant legal and environmental contexts, discussion panels with key stakeholders and decision makers on these issues, and field experiences designed Environmental Policy and Decision Making100     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  to reveal the applied context of the issues under consideration. A select number of local community members may participate in the class on a non-credit basis. 352 Sustainability in Everyday Life   0.25 unit  This course is designed to familiarize students with the variety of ways individuals and com-munities can make choices and take actions that lead to environmental and social improvements in our surroundings. The course includes five 2-hour discussion sessions on sustainability topics, one weekend field trip and one major written project. These sessions include shared read-ings, facilitated discussion, mini-lectures by guest speakers, and even hands-on applications. Puget Sound students in this class will be joined by a select number of local community members who will participate in the class on a non-credit basis.353  Environmental Careers and Callings   0.25 unit  This course provides students with opportunities to interact with environmental pro-fessionals during on-campus panels and job site visits. The course also provides context for reflection on these experiences in ways that link professional development to academic study in environmentally related fields. Class readings and discussion examine the many forces shaping not only opportunities for “green jobs,” but also our views on work and its meaning. Workshops for this course help students develop profes-sional networks as well as job seeking skills and materials.354  Contemplative Environments   0.25 unit.  This course explores the ways in which different spiritual traditions (both secular and reli-gious) consider and practice with the human relationship to the natural environment. In this light, nature is a space worth exploring in both intellectual and experiential ways, and offers the opportunity to consider how connections and relationships are formed between people and the places in which they live.355  Sacred Ecology   0.25 unit.  This course examines examples of ways in which different religions and spiritual systems think about na-ture as a resource, place, and context for beliefs and practices. How do organized belief systems relate to the natural environment, and what does this mean for the place of humans within it?356  Garden Practices   0.25 activity unit.  This quarter unit activity course is designed to give students the opportunity to gain knowledge in a variety of topics related to gardening and food production. It meets for 2 hours each week beginning three weeks into the semester, 24 contact hours over the entire course. Students also spend an hour each week independently in the garden, gaining further experience and main-taining the plants for which the course is responsible. Contact hours are divided between knowledge sharing, hands-on experience, and field trips to gardens in Tacoma. The course is student led, allowing for a peer-to-peer spread of knowledge, and gives students the opportunity to foster a sense of independence and accountability. Students who participate in the course one year have the opportunity to lead it in fu-ture years under the supervision of a knowledgeable faculty member. A select number of local community members may participate in the class on a non-credit basis.357  Environmental Challenge   0.25 activity unit  This course facil-itates student teams competing in the Environmental Challenge (EC) program, a student competition to prepare and present an optimal solu-tion to a complex “true to life” environmental problem. The EC is part of the conference hosted by the Pacific Northwest International Section (PNWIS) of the Air and Waste Management Association (AWMA), a professional organization of environmental professionals. The course requires teams of 3-5 students to submit a written proposal addressing the EC question, participation in the PNWIS three-day conference, and oral presentation and defense of the proposal at the conference. The proposals are evaluated by environmental professionals from industrial, regulatory, consulting, and academic fields. The EC problem is of cur-rent value, representative of the location of the conference, and requires a multidisciplinary approach for success. To be successful in the EC teams must seek technical and scientific analyses as well as solutions with appropriate regulatory compliance and resolution with political and community stakeholders. To be successful at the competition, student teams must research the problem background, as well as the technical, social, economic, and political aspects of the situation while staying apprised of ongoing current events related to the problem. A diversity of student backgrounds and majors are encouraged to enroll and often produce the most successful teams. May be repeated once for credit.358 Practice of Meditation 0.25 activity credit. Meditation in many forms is practiced in many religious and secular traditions around the world. In this course, students explore the intersections of mindfulness and awareness, contemplation, and meditative walking and obser-vation as a way to become more aware of their own internal thought processes. Meditation can also help students to be more focused, less stressed, and more aware of others and the place in which they reside.360  Food Systems Northwest: Circuits of Soil, Labor, and Money  Eating food is critical to everyday life, and yet many have the luxury to treat daily sustenance as an afterthought. For some, the connections between food and the larger environmental and social systems that sustain human life are largely invisible. This experiential course explores these interactions through an extensive and intensive investigation of the Northwest food system from farm to fork. For three weeks, the course travels among the campuses of Whitman College, the University of Puget Sound, and Willamette University, tracing the themes of soil, labor, and money across the Northwest foodscape. Beginning at Whitman, students focus on the political economy of the food system, training a global lens on the industrial wheat farms, chicken processing plants, and large-scale dairy operations of the Walla Walla Valley. At the University of Puget Sound, the focus shifts to urban agriculture and food justice, tracing the three themes through questions of poverty and ac-cess to food, urban planning, and the challenges of growing food in the city of Tacoma. Finally, the course concludes at Willamette where stu-dents will live and work at Zena Forest and Farm, putting the methods of sustainable agriculture into practice and exploring the opportunities and obstacles associated with smaller-scale organic agriculture in the Willamette Valley. Offered occasionally.382  Global Environmental Politics   The course examines the inter-section of environmental issues with politics and policy-making on a global as well as a local scale. It explores international structures and efforts to deal with environmental problems, a wide range of particular environmental challenges such as climate change and conservation, and the different experiences of individual countries in trying to use and manage their natural resources. Throughout, the relationships between political and natural systems are explored, with a particular focus on the ways in which politics and policy can both produce effective strategies and new difficulties for handling environmental challenges.

This is why the German Studies faculty believes that sustained immersion in a differ-ent culture is essential to a modern education, regardless of major. Adjusting to different customs, perspectives, and values as an individual within a group of native speakers allows our students to experience the dynamics of social integration from a marginal position, thus enabling them to see their own cultures in a different light. Language has meaning only in its cultural context. That’s why we teach as much about mentalities in our German courses as we do vo-cabulary and grammar. After four semesters of German, most students qualify for study in Germany and Austria, which, along with Switzerland, are multicultural societies with distinct histories, unique cultures, and different perspectives on immigration and the political process. Although many Germans speak excellent English, and graduate curricula are now taught in English, the American graduate students we inter-viewed in Germany were unanimous in the opinion that proficiency in German was essential to their success.Germany is actively recruiting students for graduate programs across the curriculum, especially in STEM disciplines. Germany offers more financial support to foreign students than any other country. German-speaking countries also offer unique job opportunities. In an increasingly international and competitive job market, studies and internships in Germany open the doors to markets in the EU, where Germany is the dominant economic power, and in Russia and China, where Germany has developed a strong presence. Knowing German also gives you unmediated access to the greatest literature humankind has produced. Alumni and alumnae report that their German finds regular application in disciplines such as philosophy, history, art history, international studies, religious studies, and musicology.In choosing to major or minor in German Studies, you will be joining an elite. Of over one hundred international fellowships and scholar-ships awarded to Puget Sound students since 2003 (Fulbright, DAAD, Congress-Bundestag Exchanges etc.), German students have won over thirty!Study AbroadRegardless of their majors, students of German are strongly encour-aged to participate in approved study abroad programs. Details of these programs may be obtained from department advisors and the Office of International Programs. Transfer Units and PlacementStudents with previous high school language study may enroll in high-er-level language courses by estimating that three  years of high school concentration are approximately equivalent to one year of college work in foreign languages. Other factors such as study abroad, living with exchange students or foreign parents, and other intensive studies may warrant special consideration on a case-by-case basis.All transfer students, especially those who have had prolonged peri-ods of time elapse since their last academic coursework, will be evaluat-ed on an individual basis. Their placement will be based on observation in courses at the Tacoma campus. German coursework completed at other accredited institutions may be accepted toward major or minor requirements subject to the follow-ing conditions:1. Campus Course Requirement: All German Studies majors must take a minimum of four courses taught in German at the Tacoma campus.2. All minors must take a minimum of three units at the Tacoma  campus.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit.

We begin in the immediate post-WWII era and continue through contemporary films, examining major trends of German cinematography during four major periods: the Truemmerfilm, the New German Cinema of the Federal Republic, DEFA films in the GDR, and the cinematic trends after German reunification. In order to UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     115German Studies/Global Development Studiescome to a better understanding of how one can define German cinema, our focus will be on both thematic and formal aspects. Class discussions will focus on questions such as: What is the relationship between a spe-cific film and its historical-cultural context? Is this relationship overt or hidden? What does (or did) a German audience see in the film? How can we analyze and interpret these films from today’s standpoint? German films might reflect on German issues, but is there a distinct German film language/style and what position do these films occupy within world cine-ma? What are the theoretical and formal concerns of German filmmakers? The course will also question and challenge the notion that something like a German national cinema exists at all. Prerequisite: -399) or instruc-tor permission. Offered every other year.415  Theory and Practice of German Drama  This course exposes students to representative German-language dramatic works, with the intention of staging a public performance at the end of the semester. Additional shorter texts on dramatic theory and visual and/or videos will supplement course materials. As a practical component to the course, we will also conduct technical acting exercises and in-class readings of the dramatic texts. Emphasis will be on closely reading texts, on dis-cussing them in German, and providing opportunities to systematically advance and improve articulation of spoken German. Students partici-pate in all facets of theatrical production, from character development, acting and performing, directing, requisitions and props, and promoting our play. Prerequisite: One mid-level German course (-399) or instructor permission. Offered every three years.420  Nobel-Prize-Winning Authors  Students read a selection of works by German, Austrian, Swiss, and Romanian Nobel-prize-winning au-thors, including Gerhart Hauptmann, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse, Nelly Sachs, Heinrich Böll, Günter Grass, Elfriede Jelinek, and Herta Müller. Prerequisite: One mid-level German course (-399) or instructor permission. Offered every three years.450  Contemporary Voices in German Literature and Film since 1989  This seminar seeks to interrogate assumptions about con-temporary German and American culture and examine how one can better define what German and ‘Germanness’ means today (if at all possible) from the perspective of the outsider, the foreigner, and the other. What do the words ‘Heimat’ and ‘Nation’ mean to Germans today and why have these notions remained so fluid – even unde-finable – in the German context? In this course, students engage with various literary texts, film, news items, and other media from Germany after reunification (1989/90). The course begins by touching on current events and debates surrounding the nation-state, immi-grants, and multiculturalism in Germany’s increasingly evolving social and political landscape in the twenty-first century. Then it explores these questions and topics in several units, focusing on the following themes: Germany’s ever-changing capital Berlin and its role within the European and German cultural landscape; perspectives on con-temporary Germany and the problems of identity, assimilation, and integration into the Leitkultur/dominant culture from German-Jewish, German-Turkish, and Afro-German writers, artists, and their com-munities; the on-going reassessment of life in the former German Democratic Republic and the phenomenon of so-called ‘Ostalgie’; and finally, Germany’s legacy of and continued struggle with fascism. Prerequisite: One mid-level German course (-399) or in-structor permission. Offered every three years.470  Writing with Light: Literature and Photography  From the very beginning of its history, photography has served as a device to reflect on and about representation. In this seminar students explore the many interrelations between literature and photography specifically in the German context as they are represented in genres of fiction, illustrated texts, autobiography, photo books, and others. Students will read and discuss selected texts, photo narratives, and combinations of photos and texts, as well as the supposed affinities and analogies between story-telling and photographic images. The course highlights theoretical texts about photography and its inclusion (or intrusion) into the literary discourse, including a short history of the medium.

Since development entails transformations at the individual, local, national, and global levels, the program consists of courses that address multiple thematic and regional dimensions of development pro-cesses.Courses in the program allow students to explore the empirical, phil-osophical, and policy dimensions of development. Faculty members at Puget Sound with development expertise teach in several departments and thus can provide students with a comprehensive set of skills and experiences for future development studies or work.Program ObjectivesBy working with diverse disciplinary lenses, textual forms, and theo-retical models, students who complete a minor in Global Development Studies should demonstrate the ability to:1. Explain how, and by whom, the concept of development has histori-cally been defined and practiced. 2. Identify the assumptions that have shaped development policy goals and the diverse kinds of evidence used to evaluate their effective-ness. 3. Understand and critically evaluate a range of development theoretical frameworks.4. Articulate connections among the political, economic, and sociocul-tural dimensions of global development.5. Demonstrate analytical, research, and writing skills through the com-pletion of a senior capstone course.6. Apply skills or engage in experiences that will enable future studies or work in the field of global development. To qualify for the minor in Global Development Studies, a student must meet the requirements specified below. While students self-select their participation in the program by completing and submitting a form to the Academic Advising office, they are strongly encouraged to meet with one of the advisory committee members to coordinate their planned curricular trajectory.Though courses that reflect a focus on development are represented in some First-Year Seminars, they do not count towards the minor in Global Development Studies. Students interested in development pro-cesses are nevertheless encouraged to consider these courses.Most courses offered in the program require no related prior study; however, students who take any of the few upper division courses with prerequisites must satisfy the associated requirements.General Requirements for the MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicated in the minor degree requirements listed below.Requirements for the MinorThe Global Development Studies minor requires 6 units:1.

Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this course explores the historical, social, political, and cultural configurations of this fact and of what has come to be known as Latina/o U.S.A. The course begins with a discussion on the roots of Spanish in the Americas. What are the historical and colonial relations of power leading to the presence of Spanish-speaking peoples and Latino cultures in the U.S.? In posing this question the course examines the nascent U.S. nation as a political and colonizing force throughout the 19th century; its politics of colonization towards Native Americans, Mestizos, and people of Spanish and African descent through the annexation of Florida (1819), the Mexican American War (1846-1848), and the Spanish-American War (1898). Departing from these moments, the course then interrogates ongoing U.S. border politics and U.S. empire building throughout the continent, further ques-tioning the following: How do U.S. policies relate to the massive Latino migratory patterns during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries? How do these shape the complexities of the Latina/o experience? Literature, film, historical accounts, and social science works serve to discuss the central issues of this course: migrations, racisms, language as a margin-alizing and/or empowering tool, key political and social moments in the Latino experience, the entrenchment of neoliberal economic policies and immigration, deportations and U.S. immigration policies, Latino community building, gender practices, heterogeneities of Latino popula-tions, and politics of identity.

Plays, short stories, novels, testimonies, poetry, autobiography, essays, and film serve to explore complex—and often silenced—histories, issues, and realities in present-day Latina/o communities. In this manner, the course looks at literature and cultural productions as a platform for cul-tural, social, individual, historical, and political expositions; a place where ideologies are contested, debated, and articulated; a site where subjec-tivities are problematized, enunciated, and made visible. Central to this course are questions pertaining to: the neoliberal market and the com-modification of the Latino body; identity construction (and/or destruction); the intersections of sexuality, gender, and class in informing discourse; racisms; discourses of privilege; language and art as a conduit for the era-sure of invisibilities; the intersections of systems of power in the literary; border politics, death and violence in the Latino experience; conditions of exile and diaspora; U.S. immigration politics, and among others; defiant Latina/o sexualities.

Students who study history develop and sharp-en their minds as they learn to think, to evaluate, to communicate, and ultimately to judge. They gain a fundamental understanding of the world in which they live and of the diverse forces that have shaped both past and present. Their work in history helps them to know themselves and to appreciate societies that are different from their own, and they dis-cover how to place contemporary issues and problems within a broad historical perspective.All students, no matter what their major, benefit from the study of his-tory. Students of the humanities learn to appreciate the development of literature, art, music, and philosophy. Social science majors better under-stand social change by examining the history of past societies. Students who major in the sciences gain insight into the complex interaction be-tween the social and cultural environment and the evolution of scientific thought. All students acquire perspective on the social, political, and eco-nomic relationships that shape the world in which they live and work. History majors who fulfill the department’s academic requirements and experience the variety of departmental instructional methods ac-quire 1) substantial and substantive knowledge of the past, 2) conceptu-al understanding of history as a scholarly discipline, 3) professional skills necessary for independent historical research, and 4) a sense of histor-ical perspective. They have an opportunity to study with excellent fac-ulty, who provide them with rigorous instruction in both broad subject areas and specialized fields. The sound training that students receive as undergraduate history majors prepares them well for graduate study in history and other professional programs, or for rewarding careers in business, education, socially oriented vocations, and government ser-vice. Indeed, the methods of learning and the ways of thinking that they develop as history students will prove applicable to the demands of any career that they pursue in later life.While courses in the Department of History, as a rule, have no pre-requisites, they are numbered at three levels that indicate increasing degrees of sophistication, difficulty of material, and workload. Most students with no college work in history first take a 100 or a 200 level course; students with particular interests, however, including juniors and seniors from other departments, are encouraged to take courses at the 300 level at any time, after consulting with members of the Department of History or the instructor. Students considering graduate study in history should seek guidance from a member of the department with expertise in their area of interest; such consultation could occur as early as the freshman or sophomore year.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. Requirements for the MajorA major in History consists of 10 units:1.

The topic must be agreed upon with a faculty mem-ber and described in a proposal at the time of registration. No more than one independent study may count toward the major or minor in history.HONORS Professor: Alison Tracy Hale, Co-Director, English; Aislinn Melchior, Co-Director, Classics Advisory Committee: Mike Benveniste, English; James Bernhard, Mathematics and Computer Science; Denise Despres, English/Honors/Humanities; George Erving, English/Honors/Humanities; Alison Tracy Hale, English; Suzanne Holland, Honors/Religious Studies; Alisa Kessel, Politics and Government; Kriszta Kotsis, Art and Art History; David Latimer, Physics; Aislinn Melchior, Classics; John Wesley, English About the ProgramThe Honors Program is an alternative pathway through the university’s required core curriculum that uniquely engages the intellectual traditions of the liberal arts as a powerful means of understanding our contempo-rary world. The program is not itself a major, but is taken in conjunction with any major. Honors students benefit from the rich conversations that build over their four years of shared academic, residential, and co-curricular experiences. Prospective students apply separately to the program (see the prompt for Honors on the Common Application), and admission is based upon prior academic achievement and demonstrated understanding of the program’s curricular and residential features. First-year Honors students live in Regester Hall (along with many students who are not in the program) and have the option to continue living in Honors-themed residences thereafter. The program also provides an array of cultural events, including a film series, student-organized din-ners, guest lectures, and trips to Seattle/Tacoma museums, theater, symphony, and opera. Honors courses examine influential authors and works in the Western intellectual tradition that for better and for worse have framed its values, attitudes, and beliefs. These courses address fundamental and enduring questions, such as “What makes something true? “What makes some-thing good or evil?” “What is the purpose of art?” “What is the proper function of government?” “What is the Self?” The course sequence culminates with an interdisciplinary study of “America” as an idea and an ideal. Honors seniors also research, write, and publicly present a the-sis (normally in the student’s major).

HUM 317,".  Offered every third year.322  The Cold War in Europe   This course examines the experience of the Cold War in Europe when Europe was divided between opposing Soviet and American spheres of influence. Students examine the origins of a polarized Europe and the crises on both sides of the Iron Curtain that threatened to unravel it. While the course has a transnational ap-proach, the main focus is on the experiences of Germany, France, and East-Central Europe (Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Hungary). Seminar discussions of primary and secondary texts allow students to evaluate recent interpretations of the Cold War in Europe. The course culminates with the researching and writing of a substantial research paper on a topic of the student’s choosing. Offered every other year.325  Totalitarian Dictatorships in Twentieth Century Europe   This course examines dictatorial regimes that had an enormous destructive impact on Europe and the world in the twentieth century: Stalin’s USSR, Hitler’s Germany, and Mussolini’s Italy. Using the comparative method, it addresses central issues in the histories of the three states that schol-ars have often grouped together under the concept of totalitarianism: the rise to power of political movements; the harnessing of the vast powers of the modern state for ideological projects such as racial em-pire and communist utopianism; explaining collaboration, conformity and resistance with secret police agencies; and the impact of dictatorships on culture, gender, and everyday life. Readings include scholarly works and primary source materials such as diaries, letters of denunciation, and fictional works. Offered occasionally.335 Intelligence and Espionage in Europe and the US  This course ex-amines the history of the activities of intelligence  services, with a focus on Europe and North America from the end of WWI to the present day. In today’s world, few figures fascinate us (or disgust us) as much as the spy, a figure whose profession poses difficult questions about truth and deception, morality and deviance, personal and national betrayal, and the power of the modern state. Beyond the popular cult of spies, however, espionage has played a crucial role in the shaping of the twentieth-cen-tury world in a number of ways: spurring the fighting (or avoidance) of wars, shaping diplomatic and military policies, propelling and exploiting technological advancements, and creating political and mass cultures. Offered frequently.343  Law, Society, and Justice in China  An international spotlight has fallen on the Chinese justice system in recent years due to a series of high-profile trials, detentions, and imprisonments. The names and imag-es of Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo, “Barefoot Lawyer” Chen Guangcheng, and Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai have graced the cover pages of newspapers and magazines around the world, and their journeys have been fodder for extended discussions and debates over the current state of the Chinese legal system. This course examines the history of law, society, and justice in China from the early imperial era to the present. During the first part of the semester students explore the phil-osophical underpinnings of traditional Chinese law and the late imperial civil and criminal justice systems. The second part of the course exam-ines the evolution of law during the Republican period as well as the legal system established during the Mao era. The course concludes by using a series of high-profile cases to unpack post-Mao legal reforms, matters of human rights, and the contemporary state of Chinese justice. Offered frequently.344  Resistance, Rebellion, and Revolution in China, 1800 to the Present   Twentieth-century China bore witness to a political revolution, a social revolution and a “cultural” revolution. This course explores the causes and characteristics of those revolutions, as well as the varying patterns of protest, revolt, and rebellion that have taken place in China since 1800. Topics covered include peasant revolts, the role of religion in rebellion and resistance to state authority, and forms of resistance and protest in contemporary China during the age of the internet. Offered frequently.349  Women of East Asia   This course examines women’s history and gender relations in both traditional and modern East Asia. Themes ex-plored include the constantly evolving roles of women in the family and as workers, artists, writers, and revolutionaries. Offered frequently.350  American Transcendentalism   The subject of the course is the New England Transcendentalists and their critics. Assigned readings include Emerson’s Essays, Thoreau’s Walden, Fuller’s Woman in the Nineteenth Century, Hawthorne’s Blithedale Romance, as well as other primary source documents on Transcendentalism and the Brook Farm community. The approach is interdisciplinary, and students with an inter-est in literature, philosophy, or religion are especially welcome. Previous work in history is not required. Offered every other year.352  The American Revolution, 1763-1789   This course emphasizes the following themes: the things that divided Americans from one another and the things that united them in rebellion; the incidents and ideology that convinced colonists that the British king, parliament, and people were conspiring to deprive them of their liberty; the reasons that some Americans remained loyalists while others became rebels; the relationship between imperial constitutional crisis and domestic social crisis; the consequences of the Revolution for women, African Americans, and Native Americans; the implications of the daring ex-periment in establishing republican government; and the legacy of the Revolution for subsequent American history. The aim of the course is to answer this question: How revolutionary was the American Revolution? Offered every other year.126     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  History353  Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War Era  This course focuses on the life of Abraham Lincoln as a way to study the Civil War era in the United States. Readings are drawn from the speeches and writings of Lincoln and from the best recent biographies and scholarly studies of Lincoln. Offered every other year.357 (Re)Constructing the Nation: U.S. 1865–1914  This course ex-plores the United States in the transformative period from the end of the Civil War to the beginning of World War One. Investigations will be fo-cused on three important domestic issues of the period--the reconstruc-tion of the nation and of the concept of race in the aftermath of the Civil War; the development of an industrialized economy and the attendant changes in Americans’ lives; and the politics of reform that emerged repeatedly during these years as Americans fought over the nature of citizenship, freedom, and justice in a rapidly changing nation. Implicit in all of these topics is the growth of the United States into a world power. All of these topics have been dramatically reconceptualized by historians in recent years, and this course emphasizes the exploration of these recent trends in the historiography of the era, including for instance new work in the history of race, gender, class, culture, the environment, and transnational relationships, as well as efforts to employ multiple histo-riographical lenses in intersecting ways that reflect more accurately the complexity of the past. Students also have the chance to work with a wide range of primary sources, and to conduct their own research. The course facilitates students’ understanding of their own world as they discover the roots of contemporary American life in the structures and lived experiences of this earlier period. Offered frequently.360  Frontiers of Native America   This course explores the political and cultural frontiers between Indian peoples and Euro-Americans from contact to the present. Students use documents, autobiography, ethnohistory, ethnography, film, and literature to examine Indian-white relations from a variety of viewpoints. The approach moves beyond a simple narrative of what happened to Indians to a more complex consid-eration of how Indians have made their own history and how that history has been presented and contested. Offered every other year.361  The United States and the War in Vietnam   This course investi-gates American involvement in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam. The course focuses on the years of the Second Indochina War (1954–1975), with particular attention to the meaning and experience of American involvement for Americans. At the same time, the course places these core subjects in the context of a larger history, including the history of Southeast Asia before and after U.S. involvement, and the legacies of the war for the United States and its citizens. Some of the issues the course explores include: Why did the United States first get involved in Vietnam? What led to the expansion of American involvement? Who were the nation’s allies? Enemies? What motivated them in their struggles? What motivated Americans who supported the war? What motivated those who opposed it? What were the experiences of the men and women who served in Vietnam? What is PTSD and why has it been such a seri-ous problem for some veterans of this war? Why did the United States withdraw from the war? What were the broader geo-political consequenc-es of American involvement? Withdrawal? How does the war affect the United States today? The course also explores closely the role of values in shaping this war, as well as the clashes between values that were both causes and consequences of the war. Includes a substantial research paper. Offered frequently.363  Americans, Catastrophe, and Culture in the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries   This course explores catastrophes in the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, using these uncommon occurrences as a window into American culture and its prac-tices. Following a roughly chronological path, the course is organized around different kinds of catastrophes Americans have faced—ranging from floods and forest fires to epidemics, from state-sanctioned vio-lence to domestic terrorism, from warfare to violent crime—and the historical themes and issues these moments of crisis revealed, and shaped. The course does not claim coverage of every disaster but seeks instead to expose students to the range of historiographical approaches employed in the study of catastrophe, and the multiplicity of issues they allow historians to explore. Offered frequently.364  American Environmental History   This course examines the relationship between human society and the natural world in what is now the United States. That relationship is complex: non-human nature sustains human society, yet people can have a profound and often de-structive effect on the natural world. Nature, nonetheless, cannot be completely altered to suit human needs: resources are finite and people are bound by the limits of biology. The environment thus simultaneously creates and limits human possibilities and reflects human influences. Through reading and discussion, participants in this course examine this reciprocal relationship between ecology and society. Offered every third year.367  Immigration in the U.S. This course provides a broad overview of the history of immigration in the United States from the colonial era to the present day. The course begins by analyzing the contours and historiography of immigration. The opening sections of the class con-sider the role of African slaves, Native Americans, the frontier, and the early republic in an effort to understand the parameters of immigration and citizenship. After establishing these debates and per-spectives, the course moves into a series of case studies that overlap with major po-litical and legislative shifts in the history of citizenship and immigration. The course looks at how factors such as ethnicity, class, religion, race, and foreign policy have shaped the immigrant experiences of various groups. The material in the course also seeks to highlight the uneven na-ture of immigration in the United States. In particular, students analyze how and why certain immigrant groups have been privileged over others to understand how these shifts have colored the immigrant narrative of the United States.368  The Course of American Empire: The United States in the West and the Pacific, 1776-1919   This course explores the politics and cul-ture of United States imperialism from the nation’s founding until the first decades of the 20th century. Focusing on westward expansion and the projection of U.S. power into Asia and the Pacific, the course considers how the ideas and policies supporting expansion and military conquest were developed, expressed, manifested, and contested. It ex-amines how various peoples have confronted U.S. colonialism, including Indians, Mexicans, Chinese, Hawaiians and Filipinos. It also examines the economic underpinnings of expansion, its environmental impact, and the racial ideas that paradoxically were used both to justify and to criticize imperialism. Offered every other year.369  History of the West and the Pacific Northwest   This course examines major themes in the history of the American West during the last two centuries, with particular emphasis on the Pacific Northwest. Themes include Indian-white encounters, the formation of frontier communities, land policy and resource use, the impact of federalism, urbanization, and the West in the American imagination. Offered every other year.371  American Intellectual History to 1865   This course examines the works of some of the more important American intellectuals who lived and wrote in the years before the Civil War. The approach is bi-UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  2018–19 GRADUATE BULLETIN     127Historyographical, and the aim is to relate ideas to the social, political, and personal situations of the thinkers. Special attention is given to the ways that these intellectuals dealt with the tension between individualism and social responsibility. Thinkers studied include Winthrop, Edwards, Franklin, Jefferson, Madison, Leggett, Calhoun, C. Beecher, S. Grimké, Douglass, Fuller, Emerson, Thoreau, Noyes, Fitzhugh, and Melville. Satisfies the Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Offered every third year.372  American Cultural History Since 1865   This course focuses on the rise of consumer culture and the way the media have influenced the formation of the American identity since 1865. The class explores the cultural significance of mass circulation magazines, advertising, photography, radio, film, television, and the Internet. Particular attention is paid to the cultural construction of race and gender. Several films are screened outside of regular class time. Offered occasionally.376  Cuba and the Cuban Diaspora  This course is centered on the common historical heritage between the island of Cuba and its diasporic populations. Dating back to the birth of the Cuban independence move-ment, exile, migration, and displacement have been nearly permanent conditions of Cuban history. This course argues that there is not only a history of Cuba but a history Cubas that have played out in Florida, New York, Spain, Mexico, and a variety of other locations as diasporic commu-nities have worked to shape both the Cuban republic and their adopted communities. This course looks at the interplay between events on the island and events in diasporic communities as a way of showing the pro-found and constant linkages between them. Along the way, the course explores how race, sexuality, citizenship, gender, culture, and a variety of other factors have shaped this shared history. Offered frequently.378 History of Latinos in the United States  This course provides an overview of the history of peoples of Latin  American descent in the United States. It begins with the imperfect term “Latino.” The earlier portion of the course attempts to unearth the complex history behind this concept and its evolution as an idea and identity. As such, the ear-lier sections of the course and later sections on Afro-Latinidad provide an overview that also considers various strains of Indigenous, European, and African history to help explore the broad and varied trajectories of peoples we now call Latinos. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered frequently.380  Modern Mexico: From Revolution to NAFTA   This course traces the emergence of modern Mexico since its 1910 revolution. It begins with attempts at economic modernization and political centralization in the late nineteenth century, considers the social upheaval of the Revolution and the consolidation of the post-revolutionary regime by 1940. A second section follows the rise and demise of the “Mexican Miracle” of growth and stability from 1940 to 1982 in the context of the Cold War. A final section considers Mexico’s neo-liberal trade and investment reforms culminating in NAFTA, along with the contradictory structures of migration, drug flows, in-bond industry in northern Mexico and militarization of the US southern border. Offered every third year.381  Film and History: Latin America   In 1915 filmmaker D.W. Griffith predicted that “moving pictures” would soon replace book writing as the principal way to communicate knowledge about the past. Both his-torical writing and movies have at various times made parallel promises to objectively convey past realities. But just as historians have ques-tioned the objectivity of the written word, one might also ask “how real is reel?” This course explores the relationship between film and histor-ical interpretation and understanding. It considers how films produced in the U.S. and Latin America interpret Latin American history, and how they can be used to understand Latin America’s past. Besides viewing and discussing around ten films throughout the semester, the class also reads a series of related historical texts, both as a point of interpretive comparison for the films, and as a point of reflection on the possibilities and limits of the academia-bound historian’s primary medium. Offered occasionally. 382  Comparative Revolutions in Twentieth-Century Latin America   Revolutions, according to H.L. Mencken, are the “sex of politics.” They offer an opportunity to glimpse social and political life in their most re-vealing forms. The goal of most twentieth-century Latin American revo-lutions has been national development, defined economically, politically, and culturally. This course explores the revolutions of Mexico, Cuba, and Nicaragua in terms of their causes, the process of revolution, and the consequences of revolution for politics, society, and culture. It also con-siders the foreign policy of the United States toward revolutionaries and revolutionary governments. Sources include historical narrative, testimo-ny, novels, and film. Offered occasionally.383  Borderlands: La Frontera: The U.S. – Mexico Border The region referred to as the U.S.-Mexico borderlands has been the subject of wide-ranging popular and scholarly treatment, especially focusing on politics, cultural contact, economic exchange, and violence. Readings cover examples of how the geo-political boundary and socio-cultural space encompassed by the region have produced persistent debate about identity formation, the fluidity of the border, and the inability of governments to restrict the movement of peoples and goods. Through close reading of primary and secondary sources, students explore sev-eral questions throughout the semester: How are “borderlands” de-fined? What role do the historical shifts in political boundaries that have occurred along the U.S.-Mexico border play in defining the geographical limits of “borderlands”? What are the origins of cross-border violence, and how have official approaches to dealing with this violence changed over time? How does the historiography on borderlands contribute to an understanding of the causes of, and popular and official reactions to, the Drug Wars currently underway? This seminar provides students with a general understanding of the scholarship and theoretical foundation of U.S.-Mexican borderlands history. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered occasionally.384  Transnational Latin America   Scholars have recently embraced a turn towards “transnationalism”—an approach to the study of the movement of goods, people, and information beyond state boundar-ies—as a framework or set of theoretical and methodological approach-es for understanding Latin America as a distinct world region. This course considers a variety of topics including environmental issues, the Cold War, the drug trade, border politics, religion, economic develop-ment, the persistence of social inequality in the region, the persistence of regional identities and loyalties, forms of political activism and the “failures” of radical politics in the context of neoliberalism. Offered ev-ery three years. 391  20th-Century South Africa   Nelson Mandela has become an international symbol of South Africa’s twentieth-century tragedies and triumphs, and for good reason; his experience touches on many of the major themes in that country’s recent history.  This course uses Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, as a starting point for exploring the history and historiography of South Africa.  Major topics include rural life and the peasant experience, “tribalism” and the signif-icance of tradition, urbanization and industrialization, the development of apartheid and anti-apartheid ideologies, and the implementation of democratic governance.  Students consider the benefits and challenges of using autobiographies as historical sources, analyzing Mandela’s ac-128     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  History/Honorscount in the context of other South Africans’ experiences. Offered every other year. 392  Men and Women in Colonial Africa   How did colonization and decolonization impact the way Africans defined themselves as men and women? How did empire and the experience of cultural difference im-pact on gender roles in Europe? How did concerns about gender shape colonial policies and Africans’ responses to those policies? Students in this course will address these questions by examining gender through a variety of analytical lenses—religion, labor, etc.—and working collabora-tively to make sense of what it meant to be a man or woman within the contexts of colonial and postcolonial Africa. Offered every other year.393  Missions and Christianity in Africa   Half of all Africans identify themselves as Christian, but their interpretations of Christianity vary dramatically.  Some follow the ancient traditions of Ethiopia and Egypt, while others embrace new and radical forms of Pentecostalism. This course will offer a narrative of Christianity in Africa from the 4th century AD to the present, with a particular emphasis on the ways both Africans and Europeans spread Christianity. The course seeks to use Christian belief and practice as a window into issues of power, gender, colonial-ism, nationalism and identity. A major focus will be the motivations behind African conversions and the ways in which Africans adapted Christianity to their own changing circumstances. Offered frequently.394  Slavery and the Slave Trade in Africa  This course introduces students to the debates surrounding the history of slavery in Africa. Did slavery in Africa predate the Atlantic Slave Trade? What impact did the Atlantic Slave Trade have on African communities? How did the Atlantic Slave Trade compare to other slave trades within and out of Africa? How were slavery and slave trading related to European colonial claims in Africa in the 19th century? These questions are addressed using both primary source material and scholarly arguments from historians, anthro-pologists and sociologists. While the course considers only in passing the contours of slavery in the Western Hemisphere, it aims to situate Africa and Africans within larger global narratives of violence, trade, and modernity,  Offered every other year.399  Special Topics In History This course is designed as an advanced seminar in which students explore the historiography on a particular is-sue, topic or field in the discipline. Though the course may be grounded in a particular nation, region, or time period, it may also involve the study of works in multiple areas. A different topic is selected by faculty each time it is offered. May be repeated for credit. Prerequisite: History 200 or consent of the instructor. Offered occasionally.400  Research Seminar in Historical Method  This course is a practi-cum in the methods and techniques of historical research and writing. Students undertake independent research in primary source materials and complete an advanced research paper. Research topics may relate to any area of history covered by department faculty, and are defined through consultation with the instructor in a process which ideally be-gins before the start of the course.

Yet within these groups, or cultures, exist vastly complex and different experiences. In the struggle for social justice and equity, queers navigate the tension of remaining hidden—to fit into the dominant culture—versus being seen—to change the dominant culture. Main units include: “Science, Sexuality, and Ethics”, “Queering School Curricula”, “Marriage is a Queer Institution” and “The Disappearing Queer: Fear and Desire in Theory”. This course addresses questions such as: How are cultures constituted, experienced, and transformed? How can we interrogate category systems to understand framing assumptions and the ways categories position “majority” and “minori-tized” in social contexts? What is the relationship between taking a subversive stance and social transformation? Cross-listed with  European Intellectual History, 19th and 20th Centuries "

Students write a final paper that is intended to establish a theoretical foundation for their senior thesis. Students take  in the junior year or in the fall of the senior year. and instructor permission. Offered every semester.407   Political Ecology   Political ecology is an active interdisciplinary framework with foundations in anthropology, geography, environmental studies and the biological sciences.  Its central contention is that our understanding of environmental issues and environmental change must include an analysis of the social, political, economic, and cultural context in which they are produced.  Through a set of advanced readings in the social sciences, students become familiar with the genealogy of this interdisciplinary approach, the keystone texts that inform contemporary political/ecological work, and the new directions that comprise the cut-ting edge of political ecology.  Recurring themes in the reading list will examine indigenous peoples struggle over resources, the construction of nature through the capitalist lens, and an examination of sustainability in both discourse and practice. Students conduct original ethnographic research that builds upon these areas of interest. Advanced coursework in anthropology, sociology, and/or international political economy is strongly recommended. Crosslisted with "
IPE 401,": Senior Thesis Seminar is the capstone course in which IPE majors share ideas, engage in critical discussions, and write and defend their senior theses. Ideally, the more that a thesis is able to build upon past work the more it can be expected to achieve.IPE Major Electives. IPE majors take three elective classes chosen in consultation with their IPE advisor. Students who study abroad are usual-ly able to count up to two classes as IPE electives. Elective courses must be pre-approved by the student’s IPE advisor in consultation with the student. Elective classes should be chosen to: broaden or deepen the student’s understanding of IPE theory; provide economic, political, social or historical context for analysis of important IPE issues; provide specific expertise necessary for a student’s senior thesis research; develop IPE research tools; or deepen knowledge of a particular country or region. Please note that at least one of the three IPE Major Electives must be an upper-division IPE course taken on the Puget Sound campus.Other Important IssuesSince most IPE majors study abroad at some point in their undergradu-ate careers, they are advised to consider foreign study options as soon as possible and to give special consideration to foreign language prepa-ration. Although some study abroad programs have no formal foreign language requirement, other programs require as many as two years of prior language study. IPE students and their advisors should give serious consideration to foreign language preparation both for foreign study and with respect to senior thesis research needs and career preparation.All Puget Sound students must take three upper-division elective class-es as part of the university’s graduation requirements. IPE students are 136     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  International Political Economyencouraged to use courses taken for this requirement to broaden their understanding of IPE and contemporary global problems. Many IPE stu-dents plan eventually to pursue advanced degrees. It is wise, therefore, to consider what undergraduate courses might be most useful as prepara-tion for law or graduate schools in addition to the coursework required for the IPE major.Students who expect to pursue Master’s or Ph.D. degrees, for example, should consult with their IPE advisors regarding additional coursework that may be necessary or advisable in foreign language, quantitative methods, or research methodology. Students who want to prepare themselves for the MBA degree should supplement the IPE re-quirements with core business classes such as accounting and finance. Students who plan to enter graduate programs in area studies, such as Asian Studies or Latin American Studies, should consider additional coursework in foreign language and literature, comparative politics, and cultural studies.General Requirements for the MajorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major; and 3) all courses tak-en for a major must be taken for graded credit.

The United States and the countries of Latin America have historically exerted great influence on each oth-er and today, in the age of hyper-globalization, are more intertwined than ever before. The required gateway course to the program is Latin American Studies 100, which fulfills the Humanistic Approaches core and explores the interaction of politics and culture at national and in-ternational levels by considering the historical legacies affecting pres-ent-day Latin American societies. Drawing on courses from Hispanic Studies, Politics and Government, Business, Art History, Anthropology, International Political Economy, and History, students minoring in Latin American Studies gain an in-depth understanding of the region, past and present, through the application of and different analytical tools and disciplinary perspectives. Students are encouraged to gain some experience abroad, particularly through the university’s semester abroad programs in Latin America (primarily Mexico, Argentina, and Chile). In addition, the Latin American Studies Program serves to stimulate inter-est and awareness at the university by sponsoring discussions, presen-tations, and cultural events dealing with Latin American issues.Upon completion of the program, students should be able to do the following:1. Understand the historical conditions and relations that shaped Latin America as a distinct regional, political, and cultural entity, and understand how that history informs contemporary relations both within the region and with other global actors;2. Identify the central people, places, events and processes that de-fine the region, with an emphasis on the heterogeneous, transna-tional nature of regional politics and culture;3. Examine and compare conceptual and theoretical approaches that have sustained and challenged the idea of Latin America and the stakes of this idea for different communities in and beyond the region;4. Apply diverse, interdisciplinary tools to critically evaluate and en-gage contemporary issues concerning Latin America;5. Engage Latin American/Latin@ culture and communities through experiential learning or internships here in the U.S. or abroad; and6. Posssess a basic competence in Spanish language.General Requirements for the MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a minor must be taken for graded credit.

Please see “Frequency of Course Offerings” on page 18. 200  Latina/o America: A Critical Introduction to Latina/o Studies   The United States is the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the world. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, this course explores the historical, social, political, and cultural configurations of this fact and of what has come to be known as Latina/o U.S.A. The course begins with a discussion on the roots of Spanish in the Americas. What are the historical and colonial relations of power leading to the presence of Spanish-speaking peoples and Latino cultures in the U.S.? In posing this question the course examines the nascent U.S. nation as a political and colonizing force throughout the 19th century; Manifest Destiny and its politics of colonization towards Native Americans, Mestizos, and people of Spanish and African descent through the annexation of Florida (1819), the Mexican American War (1846-1848), and the Spanish-American War (1898). Departing from these moments, the course then interrogates ongoing U.S. border politics and U.S. empire building throughout the American continent, further questioning the following: How do U.S. pol-icies relate to the massive Latino migratory patterns to the U.S. during the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries? How do these shape the complexi-ties of the Latina/o experience? Literature, film, historical accounts, and social science works serve to discuss the central issues of this course: migrations, racisms, language as a marginalizing and/or empowering tool, key political and social moments in the Latino experience, the entrenchment of neoliberal economic policies and immigration, depor-tations and U.S. immigration policies, Latino community building in the U.S., gender practices, heterogeneities of Latino populations, and politics of identity.

While developing a deeper understanding of oneself as a situated knower, students also explore individual religious traditions in depth, or broad themes such as the following: myth, ritual, and symbol; mysticism, magic, and medicine; beginning and end times; ethics, law, and moral philosophy; oppression and liberation; pacifism and violence; animals, bodies, and emotions. Courses are conducted with attention to structures and institutions of class, gender, sexuality, and race in their cultural and historical contexts. For the major and minor in Religious Studies, the faculty provides an introduction to the academic discipline of Religious Studies followed by careful probing of two or more important traditions and a consideration of the methods useful to their study. A major or minor provides opportu-nities to develop excellent skills in writing, analysis, and argumentation and serves as an exceptional stepping stone to graduate or professional school. Past majors have gone on to excel in the non-profit sector, law school, medical school, doctoral programs, social work, creative writing, marketing and business, among other vocations.Learning Objectives in the Religious Studies Major• To develop an understanding of a range of religious traditions, in-cluding Asian and Abrahamic• To develop an understanding of the roles religions play in political, economic, social, cultural, and moral areas of people’s lives• To gain familiarity with a variety of theories, methods, and issues involved in the academic study of religions.Religious Studies courses are grouped into the following areas: Area A.

The course teaches how to maintain an electronic notebook of calculations, to complement the traditional lab notebook. There is also a focus on standard data structures and good programming techniques, giving the student a solid grounding in modern programming tech-niques. Students who receive credit for "
CSCI 240,". Offered frequently.335  Optimization   This course is about how to find the best—or at least good—solutions to large problems frequently arising in business, industrial, or scientific settings. Students learn how to model these problems mathematically, algorithms for finding solutions to them, and the theory behind why the algorithms work. Topics include the simplex method, duality theory, sensitivity analysis, and network models. The focus is on linear models and models with combinatorial structure, but some nonlinear models are considered as well. Optimization software is used frequently. Crosslisted as , , with at least one upper-division computer science course in an area related to the project. 475  Operating Systems   One the most complex software systems ever assembled, the modern operating system serves as the interface between the human and the machine. This course traces how the sim-ple idea of ``resource sharing’’ unravels into some of the most confound-ing problems and original breakthroughs in computer science. Course topics include process and thread management, input/output, CPU scheduling, synchronization primitives, memory management, and file systems. Students taking this course learn how to deal with the intrica-cies of low-level programming, parallel computing and synchronization problems, and also receive kernel-development experience through the design and implementation of various subsystems in a real operating system. The C programming language is used for homework assign-ments and projects. Offered frequently. 481  Compilers and Compiler Writing   Compilers take input programs written in a high-level language and generate equivalent programs in a low-level language. This course introduces the mathematical tools (for-mal languages and automata) necessary for recognizing and validating input programs and the computational techniques used to construct equivalent output programs. Students develop first-hand experience with the process by implementing a sample compiler as a course proj-ect. The tools and techniques introduced in this course can be applied across a wide range of applications. In particular, this course is valuable preparation for writing any program that needs to read and act on struc-tured input files. Prerequisite: "

All states regulate occupational therapy practice, with 49 states requiring licensure and 1 (HI) requiring registration in order to practice. Currently, all state regulation requires occupational therapists to pass the NBCOT OTR® Exam. (Note that a felony conviction may affect a graduate’s ability to sit for the NBCOT certification examination or obtain a state license.)PhilosophyThe University of Puget Sound holds the belief that the academic com-munity should be a meeting place for the exchange and generation of ideas and for the personal and professional growth of individuals. The School of Occupational Therapy, therefore, is more than just a profes-sional training program. The approach of the School of Occupational Therapy is to prepare the student both for professional roles and respon-sibilities and for life. The School offers curricula that will not only provide a thorough background in a professional field of healthcare practice, but will also significantly broaden the student’s horizons. This curriculum provides the practitioner with a strong foundation for understanding and using the methods of discovering knowledge, for evaluating new knowl-edge, and for translating it into useful technology and practice.MissionThe mission of the School of Occupational Therapy is to prepare its graduates for the scientific, ethical, client-centered, and evi-dence-based practice of occupational therapy. This is achieved in a liberal arts context that promotes a community of learning, teaching excellence, scholarly engagement of faculty and students, and close faculty-student interaction. The School of Occupational Therapy is committed to equip-ping its graduates to promote the occupational participation of clients across practice settings through• Recognizing the diversity of human situations, values, occupations, and behaviors;• Exhibiting the expected qualities of a professional health care prac-titioner; and• Demonstrating beginning skills in building relationships between practitioners, clients, and the health care system.The entry-level professional master’s degree program utilizes enhanced classroom, community and clinical experiences in leadership, advocacy, and research to provide its students with the knowledge, critical thinking, and clinical skills necessary to practice general occupational therapy at the entry-level. Graduates have an excellent foundation for professional life-long learning, service to the profession, and later specialization. The post-professional clinical doctoral degree program (DrOT) allows occupational therapists educated at the baccalaureate or master’s en-try-level, including internationally educated occupational therapists, to upgrade their academic credentials through rigorous interaction with concepts of advanced theory, advocacy, teaching, and clinical research and prepares its graduates to provide clinical excellence and leadership in a self-selected area of practice.The Master of Science in Occupational Therapy DegreeThe School of Occupational Therapy offers a graduate, professional entry-level program leading to a Master of Science in Occupational Therapy degree (MSOT). Any undergraduate major may lead to the successful study of occupa-tional therapy. In fact, the program seeks a diversity of educational back-grounds among its students. A liberal education is a vital component in the preparation of today’s health care practitioner. Specific prerequisite courses also must be completed before enrollment in the Occupational Therapy program: "

For one thing, they illustrate the some-times-blurry intersection of humans, animals, and the divine; for anoth-er, they illustrate the powerful role played by animals in the religious imagination.  As the French anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss once remarked, “animals are good to think.” As others have pointed out, they’re also good to eat, ride, look at, hunt, train for battle, make things out of, and keep as companions. In religion, animals have additionally served as sacrificial offerings, totems, signifiers of purity and pollution, and foreshadowers of the apocalypse. In this class students begin to trace the vast interplay between human and non-human animals in the history of religion. Drawing from the emerging field of Critical Animal Studies, Japanimals weaves together rigorous critical theoretical inquiry with case studies drawn broadly from the history of religions, with a particular focus on case studies from Japan. Students emerge from this course able to articulate how different religious traditions have viewed animals, how religions have influenced modern conceptions of animals, and how religious traditions may (or may not) provide resources for addressing contemporary challenges facing human and non-human ani-mals.

The program is de-signed to educate an entry-level physical therapist. That is, the graduate student studies to enter the profession rather than to become a specialist within the profession.A baccalaureate degree is prerequisite for enrolling in the Doctor of Physical Therapy Program. Diversity of educational background is de-sirable among potential physical therapists. A broad-based undergrad-uate education is an integral part of physical therapy education. Any undergraduate degree may lead to the successful study of physical therapy, and undergraduates are encouraged to follow their passion in selecting a major as a strong academic record is required for success-ful application to the PT program. Student must also demonstrate ap-propriate mastery of the prerequisite courses by passing each course with a grade of B (3.0) or better.Complete information on the admission requirements and  process can be found on the School of Physical Therapy web page  (pugetsound.edu/pt).168     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  PhysicsPlease note that many more applications are received for each class than there are spaces available and that admission to the University of Puget Sound does not guarantee admission to the School of Physical Therapy.

A current as-sessment of the field of psychology recognizes its application within a wide variety of professions including business, education, law, phys-ical and occupational therapy, medicine, and clinical practice. While acknowledging this breadth of application, the academic discipline of psychology remains strongly wedded to scientific investigation as the fundamental underpinning of psychology and its effective application. Thus, a solid foundation in psychology hinges on an empirically-based understanding of human and animal thought, experience, and behavior. Psychology also has roots in the rational self-reflective capacities of the human mind, in the search for meaning within experience, and in a hu-manistic concern for others. A comprehensive understanding of the field requires research training, critical analysis of psychological theories and research, and the ethical application of scientific knowledge.The psychology faculty and curriculum represent many of the major subdisciplines in psychology (e.g., development, clinical, cognition, learning, sensation, perception, biopsychology, personality, social, and industrial-organizational). Lower division courses geared toward ma-jors and non-majors introduce students to psychological theories and ways of knowing within broad content areas. Within the major, stu-dents progress through a series of methods, statistics, and laboratory courses and take upper division elective courses to explore selected topics in greater depth. Seminars and independent study courses provide opportunities for students to approach contemporary issues in psychology and to develop the skills of scholarship at a more sophisti-cated level. Cocurricular opportunities including colloquia, internships, Politics and Government/Psychology178     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  Psychologypsychology club activities, and faculty-supervised research enhance the major for interested students.The curriculum in the Department of Psychology meets many of the broad educational goals of the university. It provides opportunities for students to strengthen both the quantitative and verbal aspects of logi-cal thinking and critical analysis. Students develop their written and oral communication skills, consider connections between psychology and other disciplines, and apply psychological concepts to practical prob-lems. Topics within psychology frequently reach students at a personal level, providing the motivation for both intellectual and personal devel-opment. Thus, education in psychology helps students appreciate their role within the broader contexts of community, culture, and the world.Students with a major in Psychology develop a. a breadth and depth of understanding of the content of psy-chology, including familiarity with the major concepts, theoretical perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends within the academic field; b. an ability to think scientifically, including constructing argu-ments, analyzing and interpreting data, reading and critiquing dif-ferent forms of scientific writing, and evaluating ethical issues and scientific standards; c. an ability to express ideas effectively, both orally and in writ-ing, within the discourse of the discipline;  d. an appreciation for and understanding of multiple perspectives, including socio-cultural, international, and individual differences as well as interdisciplinary and sub-disciplinary connections among different ways of knowing and across basic and applied approaches to the social and natural sciences; and e. characteristics valuable for personal development and effec-tive civil engagement, including the abilities to think critically, to work independently as well as collaboratively, to solve problems effectively, to act ethically, and to apply academic knowledge to real-world problems.General Requirements for the MajorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major; and 3) all courses tak-en for a major must be taken for graded credit.

Prerequisite: one course in Religious Studies or permission of instructor.301  Consciousness and the Bourgeoisie  “Know thyself” is a maxim central to the religious quest, but individuals who are intensely and ur-gently driven to know themselves often occupy the outskirts of ordinary society. Although these “outsiders” are a part of their culture and con-tribute to their culture, they no longer share the common values of their society. The course seeks to explore the role of outsiders (those who desire inner freedom and transformation) in the context of bourgeois society. The first half of the course draws on ancient materials (Epic of Gilgamesh, The Oresteia, and Plato’s Republic) in discussing ideas of ontology, psychology, consciousness, and transformation. The second half of the course relies on novels and novellas by Ouspensky, Hesse, and Mann for a discussion of bourgeois attitudes toward the outsider and toward the outsider’s struggle to become an individual who con-fronts the habitual, unconscious, and mechanical patterns of existence. Satisfies the Connections core requirement. Offered occasionally.302  Ethics and the Other   This course provides an opportunity for students to examine the contours of an ethical framework of responsi-bility by exploring contemporary moral and religions narratives about the “other” from a multicultural and interdisciplinary perspective. Students learn to apply various ethical theories to particular issues and dilemmas, such as incarceration, immigration, sexuality, disability, race, and other issues of “difference.” Offered occasionally.303  Sexuality and Religion  This course explores the intertwined his-tories of religion and sexuality in the twentieth- and twenty-first century United States, with attention to transnational contexts and global poli-tics. These two categories—religion and sexuality—are often portrayed as oppositional forces, with sexual progress pitted against religious re-sistance. This course reappraises this relationship of opposition through a series of historical case studies, which highlight the plurality of reli-gious investments in changing constructions and practices of sexuality. Offered occasionally.305  Marxism and the Messianic  The seminar focuses on the thought of Walter Benjamin, including a selection of texts commonly referred to as Benjamin’s “messianic” or “theological” writings.  Benjamin’s life, work, and influence represent a remarkable nexus of aesthetic theory, cultural critique, Western Marxism, and Jewish mysticism. The course is especially aimed at laying bare the messianic structure of his thought as most clearly demonstrated in his early essays “Critique of Violence” and “The Task of the Translator,” both published during his lifetime in 1921 and 1923. Themes include: a-theology, messianic time, utopia, apocalypse, redemption, political-theology, dialectical image, profane life, “bare life,” nihilism, violence, transcendence, and the destructive character. Offered occasionally. 307  Prisons, Gender and Education   What is the relationship be-tween the university and the prison? How does college in prison raise questions of authority, power, and privilege? Students participate in an experiential learning class that combines academic content and weekly participation in a college program at the Washington Center for Women. Students spend 3 hours per week in study halls as part of the Freedom Education Project Puget Sound (FEPPS), a signature initiative of the University of Puget Sound and a non-profit that offers a rigorous college program leading to an Associate of Arts and Science degree for 148 incarcerated women. Weekly class time includes discussion and anal-ysis of topics such as prison pedagogy, the ethical and political dimen-sions of higher education in prison, the racialized dimensions of mass incarceration, gender, sexuality in the prison, and the history and theory of punishment in the United States.  Satisfies Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement. Offered frequently.310  Christianity and Law in the West   Many of the distinctive fea-tures of the modern Western legal tradition can be traced to medieval Europe and its religious beliefs and practices. International law, law on the European continent, and law in nations following the Anglo-American tradition have been deeply colored by the assumptions and arguments of medieval canon law, the law regulating the Latin Catholic Church. This course discusses legal developments in Europe during the medieval peri-od. Topics covered include sin and crime, natural law, and law governing marriage and sexual norms. The course examines how canonical norms and ideas influenced secular law in the Middle Ages and how they have continued to shape Western law and legal theory up to the present.

The faculty in the department of Sociology and Anthropology train students in the theoretical and conceptual foundations of each discipline. Upper-level courses apply that fundamental training to the study of contemporary social issues including education, the health care system, the media, inequality, the family, deviance, and urban phenom-ena. A global approach allows students to investigate these phenomena not only in the U.S. but also in Asia, India, Latin America, and the Arab world. Students are encouraged to complement their major or minor in Sociology and Anthropology with foreign language training and study abroad. Programs in Mexico and Southeast Asia are directed by faculty in the department of Sociology and Anthropology.Faculty members representing both disciplines share a fundamental concern for engaging students in critical comparative study of social and cultural phenomena from a wide variety of ethnographic and historical contexts. The faculty attempt to expand students’ intellectual horizons, challenge them to recognize the oftentimes ethnocentric limitations of personal experience and individual biography, and encourage them to become more conscious of the ways human beings come to take the “reasonableness” of their world for granted.Student Learning ObjectivesUpon completion of their studies in Sociology and Anthropology stu-dents should be able• to take a multidisciplinary approach to problems• to model phenomena with relevant theory and concepts• to shift between multiple levels of analysis• to gather data via multiple methodological tools• to assess the quality of empirical data• to run statistical tests and draw appropriate inferences• to conduct independent research• to write clearly and persuasively• to make effective oral presentationsA major in Sociology and Anthropology develops knowledge and skills valued in a wide range of career possibilities in the private or public sec-tors. It also provides excellent preparation for graduate study in anthropol-ogy, sociology, social work, public health, law, criminology, counseling, or public policy. Furthermore, the major is a rewarding end in itself, providing students with valuable experiences for their intellectual growth.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. Requirements for the MajorThe major in Sociology and Anthropology consists of eleven courses:Required Courses: 101, 102, 295 or 296, 298, 299, 301, 490.Elective Courses: Four courses in Sociology and Anthropology, two 192     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  of which must be at the 300-level or above. ("
IPE 201," Introduction to International Political Economy Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement.101  Introduction to Sociology  This course is designed to introduce students to the field of sociology.  Sociology is a broad discipline which, at its core, constitutes the scientific study of society. Students in this course are exposed to basic concepts, theories, and methods used in modern sociology. Upon successful completion of Introduction to Sociology, students have a basic understanding of the sociological per-spective and the ways in which the discipline frames human behavior at all levels, from a brief encounter of two strangers to global social systems. The course also provides students with specific sociological tools that they can use to better understand their world; the theories, concepts, and ideas covered in this class will help students to recognize the connection between self and society, biography and history, as well as the individual and social structures. Satisfies the Social Scientific Approaches core requirement. Satisfies the Knowledge, Identity, and Power graduation requirement.102  Introduction to Anthropology   This course introduces students to the discipline of anthropology, with an intent focus on the sub-dis-cipline of cultural anthropology. Students gain an understanding of the methods, theories, and debates that characterize cultural anthropology through a critical exploration of the concept of culture, the central frame through which anthropologists grapple with gender, ethnicity, politics, economics, religion, tradition, technology, identity, globalization, and much more. The fundamentally cross-cultural, cross-temporal, holistic orientation of anthropology makes it unique among the disciplines, and its practitioners try to broaden any discussion of human beliefs and practices to include examples that are as diverse and varied as possible, while insisting on a singular, underlying, and universal “humanity.” The course draws on ethnography, a term that applies to both the immersive field research that anthropologists engage in, as well as the written analyses of cultures that anthropologists produce to better understand how culture and representations of culture structure relationships of power and inequality in the contemporary world. Satisfies Humanistic Approaches core requirement. Satisfies Knowledge, Power and Identity graduation requirement.  Prerequisite: Students who have "
SOAN 120,", or permission of instructor. Offered occasionally.316 Cultural Politics of Global Development   This course examines how culture, identity, and ethics are implicated in economic development efforts around the globe and here at home. Through a critical examination of major development theories and their assumptions about the nature of the global system and the meaning of difference within it, the course explores whose ideas about development matter, how they manifest in terms of particular policies and politics, and what stakes they pose for different social groups.  In particular, the course explores how race, eth-nicity, gender, sexuality, health, environment, and education, among other things, have structured development differences.  In doing so, the course interrogates the role that colonialism, science, capitalism, and activism have played in shaping development norms and challenges to them.  The course engages interdisciplinary and cross-cultural approaches to de-velopment through a combination of theoretical and ethnographic texts, as well as experiential learning. This course counts as one of the core courses for the Global Development Studies Designation. Not offered 2018-2019.318  Gender, Work, and Globalization  The world is becoming increas-ingly interconnected, with the movement of people, capital, and cultures across borders transforming lives all over the globe. Yet globalization also shapes, and is shaped by, gender, class, race/ethnicity, age, sexuality, and other axes of difference and inequality. This course examines how gender relations are embedded in practices of globalizing capitalism. Not only does globalization shape the lives of men and women in distinct ways, but the social and economic changes accompanying globalization affect power relations involved in masculine domination. The course will examine key developments at the nexus of globalization and gender: the feminization of poverty, feminization of migration, and feminization of workforces which are consistent features of transnational production processes. Besides analyzing the gendered consequences of globaliza-tion, including how globalization shapes the lived experiences of women worldwide, it also foregrounds how gendered subjects constitute pro-cesses of globalization.  Special attention is given to how gender shapes our ideas of what counts as “work”, both paid and unpaid, globally, as well as how gender permeates institutions, especially workplaces, but also the government and international organizations. Offered occasionally.323 The Political, Economic, and Social Context of International Tourism   In the contemporary world, tourism is often the foremost process that brings  together people from different parts of the world, allowing those from vastly different societies to interact on a face-to-face basis under peaceful, if not always equal, circumstances. As such, tourism as a phenomenon and as a process raises questions about glob-al interconnections and global movements of finance, cultural and mate-rial artifacts, ideas, and people across national and cultural boundaries. The two questions this course addresses throughout the semester are 1) what are the economic, political, social, cultural, and environmental impacts of tourism in low and middle income countries? and 2) what are the tradeoffs associated with tourism?  In tackling these two questions the course examines a wide range of issues, including the political, eco-nomic, social, and cultural implications of tourism, the impact of global tourism on environmental and global conservation efforts, and tourism as a vehicle of social change and as a facilitator of cultural and material globalization.  Crosslisted with "
SOAN 491,". Section B offered only in spring semester.  491  Senior Research Seminar In this capstone course students bring together their previous conceptual, theoretical, and empirical knowledge and skills in sociology and anthropology in order to propose and ulti-mately answer a social-scientific research question. Much of the work is done independently while under the supervision of the thesis instructor. Prerequisite: "
SOAN 490,". 494  Research Assistantship  Conducting original, independent re-search is central to the experience of the Sociology and Anthropology major.  This activity credit course pairs a student with a SOAN professor to collaborate on a sociological or anthropological research project in progress.  In the capacity of research assistant, the student contributes to the project through tasks that may include interviewing, interview transcription, survey administration, data indexing, data summary, bib-liographic research and literature review, data coding, data input, and research briefs. Specific details for each project will be specified in a written proposal prepared by the student and professor and approved by the department chair.  The proposal will (a) articulate the nature and aims of the research project; (b) set forth the terms of the work to be undertaken by the student; and (c) identify the desired research skills and objectives to be pursued. At the end of the semester, the student prepares a written summary of the experience, reflecting on skills ob-tained, challenges faced, knowledge acquired, and experiences gained through the assistantship.

THEATRE ARTSProfessor: Geoffrey Proehl; Kurt Walls, Director of Theatre ProductionAssociate Professor: Sara Freeman, Chair Assistant Professor: Jess K. SmithAbout the DepartmentTheatre Arts offers courses and creative activities in which students learn to make, understand, and evaluate theatrical events. In doing so, students acquire knowledge and skills that enable them to become collaborative, informed, imaginative, and engaged theatre makers, who – as artists, scholars, and citizens – will pursue paths after grad-uation in professional theatre, education, business, and other fields of endeavor. The faculty is committed to theatre as a liberal art and an emphasis on the total artist. Majors, minors, and non-majors develop skills and connect insights in acting, directing, design, production, dra-maturgy, research, and writing throughout their coursework, culminating in thesis projects presented as part of Senior Theatre Festival. Through participation in student- and faculty- directed productions, students ground their study of theatre in rehearsal and performance. Department productions provide the university and local community with the oppor-tunity to experience high-quality theatre of diverse style, content, and form from a variety of historical periods.The department annually offers scholarships for incoming and ongo-ing students. For information, visit the department website or contact the office administrator at 253.879.3330.The Norton Clapp TheatreThis intimate theatre, located in Jones Hall, serves as the performance center for the department. All students are welcome to audition for and participate in Theatre Arts productions.Senior Theatre FestivalSenior majors in the Department of Theatre Arts complete a culminat-ing thesis project that requires the planning, execution, and evaluation of a four-show festival of plays, collaboratively produced. This Senior Theatre Festival is the capstone of experiential   learning in the pro-gram, and draws on all areas of study in the major, while also mirroring many aspects of professional work in the field post-degree. Through an intense supervised process housed in the "
THTR 490," class, the senior class reads extensively, selects four full-length plays to produce, and determines which seniors will direct, design, dramaturg, and act in STF shows as their thesis project. This year-long ensemble process results in an April festival that is part of the department’s mainstage season.Theatre Arts faculty provide guidance, beginning with thesis-oriented readiness assessment during junior interviews. The faculty emphasizes that success in STF, particularly in key roles such as director and drama-turg, correlates with three distinct modes of achievement: maintaining at least a 3.0 GPA across all theatre classes; participating in a faculty directed show in a high responsibility production role; and a strong expe-rience in the 313 Directing class.General Requirements for the Major or MinorGeneral university degree requirements stipulate that 1) at least four units of the major or three units of the minor be taken in residence at Puget Sound; 2) students earn a GPA of 2.0 in courses taken for the major or the minor; and 3) all courses taken for a major or minor must be taken for graded credit. Any exceptions to these stipulations are indicat-ed in the major and minor degree requirements listed below. Requirements for the Bachelor of ArtsCompletion of the following 10 units: "

Grants, loans, and employment opportunities are all examples of need-based financial aid. 2) Non-need based financial aid is awarded to students without regard to financial need. Academic, talent, or achieve-ment awards are all examples of non-need based aid. Non-need based loans like Federal Unsubsidized Direct loans or Federal PLUS loans are also available to assist in managing college costs. Eligibility for need-based financial aid is based on demonstrated financial need. Financial need is defined as the difference between the total cost of attendance and the amount a student and their family are expected to contribute as calculated by the FAFSA. Financial need determines the amount of need-based financial aid (grants, subsidized loan, work-study) students are eligible to receive. Puget Sound strives to create a financial aid package that meets a stu-dent’s demonstrated need, although funding limitations or other eligibili-ty criteria can prevent us from satisfying full need in all cases.In order to remain eligible for need-based financial aid, students must complete the FAFSA each year. The amount of need-based financial aid a student is eligible to receive each year may vary depending on the level of financial need and/or other scholarship or grant assistance they receive.How to Apply for Need-Based Financial AidStudents wishing to apply for need-based financial aid must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), listing University of Puget Sound (code 003797). The FAFSA is available online at  www.fafsa.gov/. First-year applicants interested in being considered for need-based financial aid should complete the FAFSA by the application deadline for admission to receive priority consideration.  Please consult the Admission Office webpage at pugetsound.edu/apply for current applica-tion deadlines.  Graduate Students should submit the FAFSA no later than March 31.Continuing and Transfer Students for priority consideration, the FAFSA should be completed by March 31.Financial Aid ProgramsPuget Sound Scholarships and Grants Puget Sound’s financial aid program is composed of a variety of univer-sity scholarships and grants that are funded by tuition revenue, endow-ment earnings, and gifts. Part of every tuition dollar goes to support Puget Sound aid programs. Additionally, many scholarships and grants are provided through the financial commitments of Puget Sound alumni and friends. The majority of Puget Sound scholarships are offered to undergraduates at the point of admission and are subsequently renewed provided students meet the renewal criteria. A limited number of named scholarships are available to currently enrolled students who meet the selection criteria established by donors.Federal GrantsPell Grants and Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants are directed at undergraduate students with exceptional financial need. The amount of grant awarded is determined by the Expected Family Contribution (EFC) as calculated by the FAFSA. Washington State Grants The Washington State Need Grant program helps the state’s lowest-in-come undergraduates. Eligibility is determined by the Washington Student Achievement Council. Federal Direct Loans Puget Sound participates in the Federal Direct Student Loan program. Under this program the federal government serves as the lender. There are two types of Federal Direct loans: Subsidized and Unsubsidized Direct loans. The Subsidized Direct Loan is need-based and requires demonstrated need according to the FAFSA. The government pays the interest on these loans while a student is enrolled at least half time. Unsubsidized Direct loans are not need-based, interest begins accumu-lating as soon as the funds are disbursed to the university. Payment is not required on these loans while a student maintains half time enroll-ment. Students can elect to make payments towards the interest accu-mulating on Unsubsidized Direct loan by contacting the loan servicer. The interest rate for undergraduate Federal Direct loans is currently fixed at 4.45% and is subject to change.

Private loans are designed to meet educational costs not covered by other forms of financial aid, provided the qualifying credit and income criteria are met; cosigners are usually required. Information about private loan programs is available at pugetsound.edu/loans.Veterans AidSelect academic programs at University of Puget Sound are approved by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). A student who is eligible for Chapter 30, 33, 1606, or 1607 benefits should contact the Veterans Affairs Coordinator in the Office of the Registrar (Jones Hall, Room 013; 253.879.3160). A student who qualifies for Chapter 31 Vocational Rehabilitation benefits should contact Student Financial Services (Jones Hall, Room 019; 253.879.3214).Billing and PaymentPuget Sound utilizes an online billing system called TouchNet Bill + Payment. Through Bill + Payment, students and authorized users can view monthly bills, account activity and make online payments via e-check or credit card.  Semester billing information will be available online in early July for fall and early January for spring semester.  The monthly statement summarizes your semester charges (estimated tuition, fees, room and board) less your estimated financial aid, to calculate the payment due. More billing information can be found online at pugetsound.edu/admis-sion/tuition-aid-scholarships/bill-payment-information-new/.Financial aid credit is not given for work-study awards and certain out-side scholarships not disbursed directly to the university. When these funds are received, they will be used to pay off the student’s account balance or reduce the monthly payment plan balance.Funds received by the university from loans or scholarships must be applied to the student’s account if there is any unpaid balance at the time of receipt. Any expected financial aid that is delayed or canceled for any reason will increase the student’s account balance and payment due for the term.Payment may be made online through the Bill+ Payment system by e-check or credit card. Debit cards are not accepted. Credit card pay-Student Financial Services214     2018 –19 GRADUATE BULLETIN UNIVERSITY OF PUGET SOUND  ments are subject to a 2.8% service fee. Checks and cash are also ac-cepted forms of payment. Please note that credit cards are only accept-ed through the Bill + Payment system. We are unable to accept credit card payments by phone or in person by card swipe.Payment DeadlinesPayment is due by the following deadlines:Fall:  August 15Spring:  January 15Students must comply with these payment deadlines to avoid late fees. If students anticipate difficulties in meeting the payment deadline, they must contact Student Financial Services before the deadline to make special arrangements.Monthly Payment PlanThe university offers an interest-free monthly payment plan that allows for extended payment of the balance due. The net amount due for the semes-ter plus an $80 payment plan participation fee is divided into five monthly payments. Payment plan amounts may be adjusted as account changes oc-cur. The first payment is due by August 15 for fall and January 15 for spring, with additional payments due the fifteenth of each month. A late fee of $25 will be charged each month for payments not received by the due date. All monthly payment plan requests are subject to review and final approval by Student Financial Services. Payment plans may be modified or canceled if payments are not made promptly when due, or at any other time when, in the judgment of the appropriate university officials, and sufficient justification for such action exists. Registration for ClassesRegistration for classes is confirmed when the required payment for the semester has been received. Students who have not made financial arrangements by the payment deadline are assessed a $200 late fee. Students who do not have their payment arrangements completed by the tenth day of classes may have their registration cancelled.  Students are able to re-register on a space-available basis once financial arrange-ments have been made.The university reserves the right to cancel the registration of any student who fails to meet his/her financial obligations when such action is deemed to be in the best interest of the university. Such action does not, however, cancel the incurred obligations on the part of the student. The university reserves the right to withhold transcript of record or diploma, or to withhold registration for a subsequent term, until all uni-versity charges have been paid and the student’s account is paid in full. The university further reserves a similar right, as stated in the preceding sentence, if (1) any student loan is in a past-due or delinquent status, or (2) any student has caused the university to incur a financial loss and has not voluntarily repaid the loss. Tuition Adjustments Students who completely withdraw from a term or drop down in units are eligible for a 100% tuition adjustment from the 1st day of the semester through the 10th day of the semester. No tuition adjustments for partial withdrawals (drops from full to part time or reduction of overload units) are available after the 10th day of classes. Lack of attendance does not cancel the student’s financial responsibility. Students are encouraged to discuss plans for withdrawal with their Financial Aid Counselor. Tuition adjustments for complete term withdrawals after the 10th day of the se-mester are made according to the following timetable:Withdrawal from  the 11th day of classes through the end of the 4th week – 50%; withdrawal from the  start of the 5th week through the end of the 6th week-25%;  withdrawal from the start of the 7th week through the 8th week - 0%; thereafter – no refund. For the exact dates of adjustment periods by semester, refer to the Academic Calendar.Housing Refund Policy: Students withdrawing before the 10th day of classes will receive a 100% refund on housing charges but will be as-sessed a $500 housing cancellation fee. Room charges are non-refund-able for students withdrawing after the 10th day of classes. Detailed information on the room charge refund policy is available from the Office of Residence Life. Board charges will be adjusted based upon the unused portion of the student’s meal plan for those students who withdraw before the end of a semester.Financial Aid for students dropping from full-time to part-time or com-pletely withdrawing will be calculated to determine whether a portion of federal and institutional aid must be returned. Adjustments for students dropping from full-time to part-time status are based on the date a stu-dent drops in status and the overall changes in tuition and fees, coupled with any other particular award requirements. Adjustments for students completely withdrawing are prorated, calculated on a daily basis up to the 60% completion point of the semester. Please note that the Financial Aid Return policy and calendar is different from the Tuition Adjustment policy and calendar for reasons of Title IV Federal Aid regulatory compliance.Tuition adjustments are adjustments of charges assessed, and are not calculated based on payments made. A full copy of the refund policy, with examples, is on file in the Student Financial Services Office.All financial aid information, including program eligibility, award amounts, and loan interest rates, is subject to change.BOARD OF TRUSTEESOfficersRobert C.
