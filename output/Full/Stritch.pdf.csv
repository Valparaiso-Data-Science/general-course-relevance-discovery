The University is guided by the Catholic, Franciscan values of creating a caring community, making peace, showing compassion, and reverencing all creation as we embrace and cultivate the diversity of all of God’s creation.  VISION OF THE SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS OF ASSISI FOR CARDINAL STRITCH UNIVERSITY  Rooted in the values of Catholic Christianity and inspired by the spirit of St. Francis and St. Clare of Assisi and the heritage of the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi, Cardinal Stritch University is an academic community called to transform individuals to “approve the better things” as they discover their purpose in life.   The University encourages academic excellence, along with intellectual, spiritual, and social growth among its entire community—faculty, staff, and students of all ages, faiths, and ethnic backgrounds.   FRANCISCAN VALUES  The Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi have articulated a set of values to foster a spirit of service and to renew the University’s Franciscan heritage. The values are as follows:   Creating a caring community by respecting each individual’s personal dignity; extending hospitality, courtesy and kindness; and sharing friendship and openness  Showing compassion by serving and caring for the poor and oppressed; having concern for justice issues; taking responsible social action; offering unselfish service  Reverencing all creation by respecting all creatures; fostering a simple lifestyle; promoting human dignity and empowerment of people; and exhibiting concern for environmental issues  Striving for making peace by healing and reconciling; working for conflict resolution; forgiving; and caring and understanding   INSTITUTIONAL GOALS  At the undergraduate and graduate levels, Cardinal Stritch University’s academic programs emphasize general studies, professional preparation and community service. The University is dedicated to assisting individuals in their personal development through pursuit of the liberal arts and career-related courses in a campus atmosphere pervaded by the Judeo-Christian tradition.   The University seeks to foster Christian humanism, professional betterment and good citizenship. To this end, faculty and staff are particularly interested in promoting the intellectual growth, moral formation and self-disciplined behavior of students in such ways that they will become as much concerned about human resources, society’s needs, social justice and world peace as they are about the fine arts, the sciences and other fields of knowledge.  THE HISTORY OF CARDINAL STRITCH UNIVERSITY  Cardinal Stritch University is a fully-accredited, Franciscan Catholic University rooted in the liberal arts, located in metropolitan Milwaukee, offering quality, value-centered education to men and women of all ages, races and creeds.   The University was chartered in 1937 by the state of Wisconsin as a degree-granting institution for the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi. Its original name was St. Clare College. In 1946, the name was changed to Cardinal Stritch College in honor of the former archbishop of Milwaukee and a long-time friend of the Sisters, Samuel Cardinal Stritch. That same year, laywomen were first admitted.   Until 1962, Stritch was located on Milwaukee’s south side and, while still at that location, in 1956, a graduate division was established. The Sisters had long been recognized for their pioneering efforts and expertise in the fields of special education and reading, and it was these majors that were offered through the new graduate division. Male students were allowed to enroll in these programs, making the graduate division coeducational, while the undergraduate division remained all women until 1970.   By 1982, the need became apparent for a non-traditional delivery system that could accommodate adults returning to school. In answer to this need, Programs in Management for Adults (PMA) were implemented. Designed specifically for the busy   Page 9    schedules of working adults, these programs were enthusiastically embraced. In addition to on-campus offerings, courses were, and continue to be, available at off-campus sites at various locations in the state of Wisconsin.  In 1987, the programs’ success led to the extension of the College of Business and Management to include course offerings and a regional office in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of Minnesota.   In 1997, the Cardinal Stritch College Board of Trustees approved and signed a proclamation to move to University status, culminating a two-year research and assessment process. With distinct academic divisions, a heterogeneous student population and a full array of undergraduate and graduate programs, “University” was considered a more appropriate identifier for the institution. With this decision, the college was renamed Cardinal Stritch University and the academic divisions became colleges: College of Arts and Sciences, College of Business and Management, College of Education and Leadership, and the College of Nursing. The Board of Trustees of the institution reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining its Catholic and Franciscan identity, its Franciscan values, its rootedness in the liberal arts, the primacy of the faculty teaching role, the accessibility of faculty and staff, small class sizes, courses taught by faculty, providing undergraduate and graduate education, providing traditional and non-traditional approaches to education, and continuing its community service outreach efforts.  In 1998, the first doctoral degree program was offered at Stritch, the Doctorate in Leadership for the Advancement of Learning and Service.   In 2007, the Saint Clare Center for Ministry Formation was established. The Center, renamed the Saint Clare Center for Catholic Life in 2010, is designed for the education and formation of lay and ordained ministers of the Milwaukee Catholic Archdiocese and other Christian churches of southeast Wisconsin.   In 2009, Stritch opened the City Center in the former Laboratory Building at The Brewery redevelopment project in downtown Milwaukee, establishing a major new University presence in the heart of the city.   In 2012, Stritch celebrated its 75th anniversary with events, exhibits, performances, and volunteer activities highlighting the University’s history and legacy.  In 2014, Stritch renamed its Ruth S. Coleman College of Nursing to recognize the launch of academic degree programs in health sciences, beginning with the first post-licensure Bachelor of Science in Respiratory Therapy Completion program in the state of Wisconsin. The college is now known as the Ruth S. Coleman College of Nursing and Health Sciences.  Today, programs at the associate, bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral levels, offered through both traditional and non-traditional delivery methods, continue to position Stritch as a pioneer and innovator in higher education.  STUDENT BODY  The diverse student body at Stritch includes recent high school graduates, college transfer students, working professionals, veterans of the armed services, retired persons, and returning adult students. The University’s total full- and part-time enrollment of more than 3000 students includes about 300 students living on campus, as well as those who commute and those who take courses off-campus at convenient locations throughout Wisconsin and Minnesota as well as online.   FACULTY AND STAFF  Stritch is proud of its administration and teaching faculty, which include both lay and religious members. Full- and part-time personnel include men and women who are highly qualified and experienced in their respective fields. More than half of the full-time faculty members hold terminal degrees in their fields, most of these doctorates. A number of faculty members have established national reputations for their professional achievements and creative talents. Unlike larger institutions of higher education, Cardinal Stritch University does not employ graduate assistants as instructors so students benefit from direct access to faculty members in all of their classes.   LOCATION OF THE CAMPUS  Stritch occupies 40 acres of park-like campus in the residential suburbs of Fox Point and Glendale. Downtown Milwaukee is about a 10-minute drive away, and Lake Michigan is within walking distance of the campus. The University is just off Interstate 43, providing easy accessibility by almost any form of transportation: Mitchell International Airport is minutes away, as are the Greyhound and Badger bus depots, and Amtrak railway station.   For commuter students, the Milwaukee County Transit system provides direct service to the University via bus route 63.   Page 10    ADMISSION TO UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS   GENERAL ADMISSION INFORMATION  Undergraduate programs at Cardinal Stritch University are open to prospective students who have a high school education or its equivalent.

High school students may enroll as a non-degree seeking student in a course for audit or for credit after securing the appropriate approvals. Non-degree students who desire to make application for acceptance into a degree program must follow the regular application procedures for degree students. At the time of such application, credits earned as a non-degree student will be reviewed and the student apprised of how the credits can be used in meeting degree requirements.  Traditional Calendar Degree Programs or Courses Prospective applicants are encouraged to check with their enrollment representative in enrollment services on the availability of desired courses prior to completing the application. A course schedule and catalog may be obtained online at www.stritch.edu. Special student applications are accepted two weeks prior to each term.  Non-degree seeking students are required to pay a $100 tuition deposit at the time of registration. Non-degree seeking students are not eligible for federal, state, or institutional financial aid.  Non-degree seeking fall into three categories: Personal/Professional Enrichment, Potential Degree Student and Seeking Credit to Transfer. Special students of any classification may take up to nine credits per semester at Stritch.   Personal/Professional Enrichment students may continue as a special student indefinitely without applying for formal admission to a degree program. Students in the category of Potential Degree Student may only enroll for a total of two semesters before they are required to submit an application and transcripts to the office of admissions. Students seeking credit to transfer may be eligible for financial assistance from the other institution they are attending.   Evening/Online Degree Programs or Courses Students wanting to take courses as a non-degree student in the College of Business and Management should contact an enrollment representative in enrollment services. Students in the College of Business and Management’s programs may take up to 12 total credits as a non-degree seeking student.   TYPES OF ADMISSION Applicants may be admitted to the University under the following types of admission and should refer to their official letter of admission for specific details:   1. Full admission is granted to applicants who submit all required official admission documentation and meet minimum standards for admission.   2. Probationary admission is granted to applicants who submit all required official admission documentation but do not meet all minimum standards for full admission to the University. Probationary admission will be granted on a case-by-case basis and may include a period of academic probation. Failure to meet academic probation criteria associated with a probationary admission could result in dismissal from the University.   3. Provisional admission is reserved for students who are currently enrolled in classes at another college or university. Students in this situation may submit unofficial transcripts obtained from the Registrar at the institution in which they are currently enrolled. These applicants must meet minimum standards for admission.  A provisional admission status will not be removed until an applicant provides all official admission documentation, and a final application review is conducted,   Page 13    resulting in the appropriate final admission decision. If students are not currently enrolled in classes at another institution, they must submit final/official current (less than one year old) transcripts from all previous institutions before an admission decision can be made.  Students are allowed to remain in a provisional admission status for one term. If a provisional admission status is not resolved within these timeframes, the student may not be allowed to enroll in additional coursework. Provisional admission could impact financial aid eligibility and receipt of financial aid funds.   Upon acceptance to the University, applicants must submit a $100 tuition deposit. Fall semester deposits received after May 1st are not refundable. Spring and summer semester deposits are refundable up until 10 business days before the first day of classes.  UNDISCLOSED TRANSCRIPT POLICY Undisclosed records or transcripts may be grounds for dismissal or rescinding of admission. All applicants seeking admission to degree and/or certification programs at Cardinal Stritch University are required to disclose all previously attended institutions on their application for admission. In addition, all applicants are required to submit official transcripts related to any previously attended institutions.   The following policies and procedures pertain to transcripts not disclosed by an applicant during the admission process. Policies are based on the enrollment status of the student.    Applied, Not Yet Admitted: Applicants who have applied but have not yet been admitted will be in a pending status until all transcripts are received by the University. The applicant will be notified that an admission decision will not be made until all transcripts, including the previously undisclosed transcript(s), have been received and their application file is complete.    Admitted, Not Yet Enrolled: Applicants who have been admitted but are not yet enrolled in courses, will have their admission decision rescinded, and their admission status will be revised to pending/held. The applicant will be notified of this action and that a final admission decision will not be made until all transcripts, including the previously undisclosed transcript(s), have been received and their application file is complete.    Re-Entry: Applicants seeking re-entry to the University will be processed according to the policies outlined above. Credits appearing on previously undisclosed transcripts will only be considered for transfer from the date of re-admission to the University and/or the date of last attendance at the University.    Admitted and Enrolled: Applicants who have been admitted to the University and are enrolled in courses will be considered in violation of the University’s academic integrity policies and referred to the Office of Academic Affairs for review and possible dismissal. If the student is allowed to remain enrolled at the University, credits appearing on previously undisclosed transcripts will not be considered for transfer.  Students Continuing on to Next Degree Level Students who complete a degree at one level and wish to continue onto a higher degree level at the University must follow all the admissions procedures for the new degree.  They must complete all degree requirements and be cleared for graduation for the first degree before being fully admitted to the second degree program if it is at a higher level.  In addition, students cannot finish one degree and start the next within the same term; they must wait until the subsequent term to begin their next degree.  For example, a student in an evening College of Business and Management bachelors program who finishes during the fall term (whether in September, November, or December) cannot start the MBA program until the spring term (January or February).    Page 14    ORIENTATION, ADVISING AND REGISTRATION  NEW STUDENT ORIENTATION  The University provides mandatory orientation programs for all incoming students.  New Student Orientation (NSO) is an interactive program for all first-year undergraduate students. The 4-day program serves to provide a unique opportunity for newly admitted students to become familiar with university resources, policies and procedures facilitating their academic and personal success. In addition, students will explore the mission of our Catholic Franciscan University and the vision of our founders, the Sisters of St. Francis of Assisi. This is accomplished through lectures, activities, programs and social events that will allow students to connect with their peers, and meet with campus faculty, staff and administrators.  Stritch also offers unique, specialized orientation programs for our transfer students and adult students. .While the purpose of these programs is similar to the NSO, they are specially designed to help students adjust to a new academic learning environment. Although mandatory, these programs are shorter and tailored to the different needs of these students.  Whether transferring from a different institution, returning to school after a break, or starting college for the first time, students will receive key information at an orientation program and will be provided with the tools to be a successful Stritch student.   ADVISING AND REGISTRATION  Stritch strives to make academic advising and course registration an understandable and supportive process for students.  Toward this end, many students have multiple advisors working with them to assist with their academic planning and schedule.  However, while students have various advisors on campus to help them with their degree requirements, it is a students’ sole responsibility to ensure they meet all requirements for their degree.  Students must resolve all financial obligations and be fully admitted to the University prior to registering for classes.  Traditional Calendar Degree Programs Undergraduate students register for their courses online through My Stritch. Students enrolled in a traditional calendar bachelor’s degree program (except for Bachelor of Science in Nursing) must meet with their major/departmental advisor prior to the registration period every semester to receive registration clearance. At this meeting, major advisors will counsel students on which courses to take during the upcoming term for their major and will then clear the students to register. Current students without a declared major or pursuing an Associate of Arts degree program are required to meet with a member of Academic Advising before registering.   Students enrolled in programs in the Ruth S. Coleman College of Nursing and Health Sciences or adult evening/online programs in the College of Business and Management are not required to meet with an academic advisor prior to registration each semester. However, all registration changes are provisional until approved by an academic advisor.   When a student’s registration time arrives (as determined by the total number of credits earned and in progress), he/she may then log into My Stritch and register for courses.   Academic advisors monitor students’ overall curricula, including liberal arts core requirements, electives, and total credits earned. Therefore, students are welcome to meet with their academic advisor prior to registration to ask questions, discuss core requirements, create a draft schedule, etc., but it is not required.   During the first week of semester-long classes, students may adjust their schedules (add and drop classes) online through My Stritch. Students in evening/online programs (6-week or 12-week long courses) may adjust their registration for a course prior to the start of the course. Once the drop/add period has passed, students must see their academic advisor to withdraw from a course.    Page 15    TUITION, FEES AND FINANCIAL AID  TUITION, FEES AND REFUNDS  Payment of fees for undergraduate and graduate programs occurs as written on the general information sheet, which is published each semester. This sheet includes information regarding tuition, payment of fees, payment plans, financial aid, late fees, and deposits as well as withdrawal and refund processes. A late fee may be charged for payments made after the due date.  In addition, all tuition and fees are listed online at www.stritch.edu.  Any tuition deposits paid will be credited to each student’s account. If students decide not to attend courses, they may request a refund of the tuition deposit. The request must be made in writing to the Business Office by the date indicated on the general information sheet.   Admissions representatives and Accounts Receivable Specialists will provide students with information regarding tuition, fees, and payment schedules.  Financial transactions for students take place in the Business Office, located in the Bonaventure Hall Atrium.   GENERAL FINANCIAL AID INFORMATION Cardinal Stritch University offers awards which recognize achievement and provide financial assistance to eligible students who are unable to meet their total University expenses. Eligibility for financial aid programs is based primarily on financial need — the difference between the total cost of attending and the expected ability of the family (as determined by the FAFSA – Free Application for Federal Student Aid) to contribute toward these expenses.   The Financial Aid Office determines each student’s eligibility for financial assistance using federal methodology. The Financial Aid office will create a Cost of Attendance/Budget for every student based on their enrollment in the award year. Components will include Tuition/Fees, Room and Board, Books & Supplies, Miscellaneous Expenses, and Transportation. This Budget will be used in determining a student’s Need and overall award. Students must submit an approved application form annually to determine their eligibility for federal, state, and University aid. The methodology assumes that it is the primary responsibility of the student and/or the student’s family to pay for University costs. The ability to pay is determined by examining the family’s current financial situation and considering such factors as parental income and assets, student income and assets, taxes paid, family size, nontaxable income and benefits, etc.   Occasionally a student and/or student’s family has special circumstances that can impact the ability to pay. Special circumstances may include, but are not limited to, unusual medical expenses, loss of employment, and divorce/separation. In such cases, the students should contact the Financial Aid Office to discuss possible options for an additional review of their financial aid information.   FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCEDURE All new students should apply for financial aid well in advance of their intended enrollment date. Students are encouraged to apply for financial aid when they apply for admission to the University.   Students should complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) online at www.fafsa.gov each year.  FAFSAs are available and can be filed October 1 for the next academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to submit their financial aid form(s) by December 1st in order to be considered for all forms of assistance.   If a student is selected for verification, due to federal verification requirements, a signed IRS tax transcript from the student and/or parent, a signed copy of the student’s and/or parents’ federal income tax form, and/or other pertinent financial records may be needed to complete the financial aid application process. The Financial Aid Office will request the required documents on an individual basis, as needed. Students can check what documents the Financial Aid office needs by logging onto their online aid service page at www.stritch.edu/onlineaid.  This page has the same log-in information as Wolfmail.  The Financial Aid Office attempts to provide financial aid awards to make a Stritch education as affordable as possible for the student/family. Gift aid is awarded to the fullest extent possible based on the individual student’s financial aid eligibility and/or academic achievement. Student loans and student employment are also awarded to provide students with the maximum financial assistance. While students may be eligible to borrow and/or to work, they may decline fully or accept lesser amounts of these types of assistance. In addition, Cardinal Stritch University participates in many other federal and state financial aid programs.   Page 16     Financial Aid that a student accepts will be ordered from the various funding sources and disbursed to the student’s account, once the student is seated in class for the term. The aid will be used to pay all applicable current charges and any excess will be cut in a check to the student.   All students receiving financial aid are required to make satisfactory academic progress toward a degree. Lack of satisfactory progress will result in the suspension of further financial aid until students are again in compliance with the satisfactory academic progress policy or have successfully appealed the suspension of their aid.   FINANCIAL AID ATTENDANCE POLICIES  Institutional Holidays and Designated Breaks Traditional Calendar Degree Programs Scheduled breaks are published in the academic calendar. Students are allowed a summer break between academic years. Individual programs may vary from the University academic calendar. In these cases, scheduled breaks will follow the published program calendar.  SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS (SAP)  The Department of Education requires institutions to establish and apply reasonable standards for measuring satisfactory academic progress (SAP) in a student’s educational program for the purpose of determining eligibility for financial aid under Title IV HEA programs. This policy outlines the definition of student progress towards a degree, the consequences to the student if progress is not achieved, and how a student can reestablish eligibility.   Institutions are required to measure satisfactory academic progress using both quantitative and qualitative standards. These standards are defined below. Failure to meet either the quantitative or qualitative standard requirement will result in a warning, probation, or a suspension of financial aid.   Quantitative Standards  Maximum Accumulation of Credits/150% Rule  Each academic program has a published program length, measured in credit hours. Students will not be eligible for financial aid for any credits that are attempted in excess of 150% of the published credit length of their program.  Credits transferred to the University shall be included in the calculation of attempted and completed credits for the purpose of determining the total 150% timeframe.  Any course with a grade of “W”, “WU”, or “WF” will counted in the credits attempted calculation. If after review of a student’s satisfactory academic progress status it is determined that a student will exceed 150% of the published program length, or will be unable to complete his or her program within the 150% timeframe, his or her Title IV financial assistance will be suspended. Students may appeal the loss of financial aid eligibility due to the 150% rule.  The appeal process is defined within the “Appeals and Reinstatement” section of this policy.    Examples: Degree  Published Program Length (Credits)  150% Credit Limit  Associate  70  105  Bachelor’s  120/128  180/192 The undergraduate catalog defines the number of credits needed to complete each program.   Students in the standard term programs should complete at least 67% of the credits they attempt in a semester in order to stay on track to complete their program within the maximum timeframe.   Minimum Rate of Successful Course Completion  Students must earn at least 67% of the credits that they attempt.  Satisfactory academic progress is checked at the end of each payment period for non-term programs, and the end of every semester (including the Summer term for those enrolled in it) for standard term programs. Credits transferred to the University shall be included in the calculation of attempted and completed credits. Courses in which a student receives an incomplete will be counted as attempted but not as earned credits.  Once an incomplete is resolved, a student can notify the Financial Aid Office to have their rate of   Page 17    completion reevaluated. Grades of “W”, “WU”, and “WF” will be treated as attempted and not earned.  Courses that are repeated will be treated as attempted, but only will count as earned credits once. A student can repeat a course that they receive an “F” grade (fail) in, and receive aid, as many times as it takes to pass the course. A student can repeat a course that they received a “passing” grade in, and receive aid, only once. Developmental (remedial) coursework will be counted as attempted and earned as long as a minimum grade of “C” or better is achieved. Courses taken as audit are not counted as attempted or earned credits.  Examples: Credits Attempted Minimum Necessary Credits Earned 24 17 48 33 72 49 96 65  Qualitative Standards  Minimum Grade Point Average  Students must maintain an acceptable cumulative grade point average (GPA) throughout the duration of their programs.  For undergraduates, the minimum cumulative GPA shall be 2.0This will be checked at the end of every semester and/or payment period.  A student’s cumulative GPA is calculated using only those credits and grades earned at Stritch.  The GPA is computed by multiplying the credit hours for each course by the quality points earned for each grade received. The quality points for all courses recorded are totaled, and this number is divided by the total number of semester credits graded.  All courses are included in the computation except those in which grade of “W” (Withdrawal), “WU” (Unofficial Withdrawal), “S” (Satisfactory)”, “DV” (Developmental Credit), “I” (Incomplete), and “AU” (Audit) are received.  Please note, while a grade of “W” or “WU” are not included in the GPA computation, a grade of “WF” (Failing Unofficial Withdrawal) is.  A grade change will cause a student’s GPA to be recalculated.  A student should notify the Financial Aid office to have their SAP reevaluated in the case of a grade change.   Students taking “DV” (Developmental/Remedial credits) must receive a “C” grade or better in those courses to be considered in good SAP standing.  Undergraduate level prerequisite courses taken as part of a graduate degree program are not included in calculating the GPA.  For courses that are retaken by a student, the grade awarded for the course the first time it was taken remains on the transcript, but is no longer counted in the GPA.  Students who are Changing Majors or Degrees/ Students Pursuing a Second Degree  When a student changes his/her major, any courses taken under the old major will be included in the SAP calculations for the new major.   When a student changes his program or degree track any coursework from the old program/degree track that applies to the new program/degree track will be included in the SAP calculations.    When a student is pursuing a 2nd degree, any courses that were taken during the 1st degree that are transferred in to apply to the student’s 2nd degree will be included in the SAP calculations.   Consequences of Failing to Meet SAP Standards  Financial Aid Warning Status  Any student who does not meet satisfactory academic progress during a given semester or payment period will be put on financial aid warning status for the following semester.  A student may receive financial aid while on warning.  No appeal is necessary for students on warning status.   A student will be notified in writing that his/her financial aid is now in a warning status.   Page 18     Financial Aid Probation Status  If after a semester of financial aid warning a student has not reestablished eligibility based on the qualitative or quantitative standards described above, the student has lost eligibility for financial aid. The student may submit an appeal to the Financial Aid Office (the appeal process is described below).  This appeal will be reviewed by the SAP committee and, if approved, will allow the student to be placed on probation status (if denied, see Financial Aid Suspension Status below). If it is determined that a student cannot regain eligibility after one semester/payment period on probation, an academic plan may need to be established. Failure to adhere to the academic plan would result in the student being placed on a financial aid suspension status.  A student will be notified in writing that his/her financial aid is now in a probationary status along with any conditions associated with this status.  It is the student’s responsibility to meet these conditions. Conditions may include (but are not limited to) weekly meetings with Academic Support, check-ins with a student’s advisor, etc.  Financial Aid Suspension Status  Any student who is failing the SAP standards and who does not appeal, has an appeal denied, or does not agree to adhere to an academic plan (if necessary) as part of their probationary status, will be placed on financial aid suspension. A student on suspension has lost eligibility for financial aid. The process for re-establishing eligibility is outlined below.  A student will be notified in writing that his/her financial aid is now in a suspended status and how to reestablish financial aid eligibility.  Re-establishing Financial Aid Eligibility  If a student loses eligibility for financial aid, he or she will need to obtain a minimum 2.0 cumulative GPA (undergrad) or 3.0 cumulative GPA (graduate), and re-establish a completion percentage of at least 67% for attempted coursework while not receiving financial aid at the University. He or she will have to notify the Financial Aid Office once the above minimums have been achieved to verify if eligibility for financial aid can be reinstated for further coursework. A student who transfers to another institution and then reenrolls at the University will need to have sufficient transfer credits to obtain the above quantitative standards in order to reestablish eligibility for financial aid.  Appeals and Reinstatements  Students are able to appeal the loss of financial aid eligibility due to their failure to meet satisfactory academic progress standards after a semester or payment period on financial aid warning status.  Students are also able to appeal the 150% rule if they feel there are extenuating circumstances that prevented them from completing their program of study within this defined limit.  Circumstances that may warrant an appeal include, but are not limited to, the following examples: medical reasons, full-time employment, or being out of school for a long period of time.  Previous non-receipt of federal financial aid funds does not qualify as an extenuating circumstance.  As part of the appeal, a student is required to provide information regarding why he or she failed to make satisfactory progress, and what has changed in the student’s personal situation that will allow them to demonstrate satisfactory academic progress at the end of his or her next semester or payment period.  A student who is failing SAP would address this appeal to the Financial Aid Office.   Appeals will be reviewed by a SAP committee on the second and fourth Thursday of every month.  The SAP committee will be comprised of two members of the Financial Aid team (with one member representing either the Director or Associate Director), a member of the Academic Advising team, and a member of the Registrar’s Office. This committee will be responsible for reviewing the appeals and either reinstating eligibility for financial aid via the financial aid probationary status, or placing a student in financial aid suspension status.  The decision of the committee is final.  Students will be notified in writing of the appeal decision within approximately two weeks of the committee’s meeting.  STUDENT CLASSIFICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID The criteria used by the Financial Aid Office for determining student classifications for financial aid eligibility differs from the criteria used by the University. For financial aid purposes, the following criteria will be used:  Freshmen 0-23 credits  Sophomores 24-47 credits  Juniors 48-71 credits  Seniors 72 and more    FEDERAL AND STATE GRANTS    Page 19    The following grants are awarded based on the student’s/family’s financial need (as determined by the FAFSA – Free Application for Federal Student Aid).

To be eligible to receive any federal loans, students must follow the general application procedures.   William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program (Subsidized and Unsubsidized)  This program enables students to obtain long-term, low-interest loans to help meet their educational expenses. Any student who is enrolled at Cardinal Stritch University at least half time in a degree or eligible certificate program, who is a citizen or a permanent resident of the U.S., and is not in default on another federal student loan may apply. Applicants must maintain satisfactory academic progress. A student’s financial aid package must be completed prior to approving the amount of the loan since loan amounts are dependent upon other aid received. The Subsidized Direct Loan is a need-based loan where interest on the loan is paid by the federal government while the student is in school at least half time. The Unsubsidized Direct Loan is available regardless of need, but interest will accrue while the student is in school. Students can make arrangements to pay the interest as it accrues or they can defer that interest and it will be capitalized prior to repayment. The interest rate for both loans is fixed.   Federal Direct Loan Limits – Dependent Students Per academic year, freshmen may borrow up to $5,500 of which no more than $3,500 can be subsidized; sophomores may borrow up to $6,500 of which no more than $4,500 can be subsidized; and juniors and seniors may borrow up to $7,500 of which no more than $5,500 can be subsidized.  The cumulative maximum amount of loan money for undergraduate students is $31,000 of which no more than $23,000 can be subsidized. For both subsidized and unsubsidized loans, repayment begins six months after dropping below half-time enrollment or leaving school.   Federal Direct Loan Limits – Independent Students  Independent students may be eligible for an additional $4,000 in an unsubsidized loan as freshmen and sophomores, and an additional $5,000 in an unsubsidized loan as juniors and seniors. These funds are in addition to the dependent student loan levels. The aggregate loan limit for independent students is $57,500 of which no more than $23,000 can be subsidized.   Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students (PLUS loan)  PLUS loans enable parents of dependent undergraduate students to borrow funds for educational expenses from the Department of Education. This loan is available to credit-worthy parents regardless of need. Parents may borrow up to the cost of education minus other financial aid (as determined by the Financial Aid Office). Repayment of these loans begins 60 days after disbursement. Repayment may be deferred as allowed by the Federal government. The interest rate is fixed. Dependent students whose parents are denied a PLUS loan may have access to additional Unsubsidized Direct Loans.   STUDENT EMPLOYMENT The Student Employment Program at the University is designed to engage students in intentional personal and professional development while they are working on-campus in a variety of roles.  On-campus jobs are available for students with and without financial need, with preference given to those students with financial need who are enrolled full-time. Those students with financial need who are enrolled for fewer than 12 credits but more than six credits are also eligible.  Students are required to register for the Student Employment Program with the Experiential Learning and Career Education office.  Please note that there are a limited number of student jobs available, so students need to be proactive in their search. Students interested in locating part- or full-time employment can schedule an appointment with a career professional to develop a job search strategy. Student worker opportunities are posted at http://www.stritch.edu/Student-Experience/Career-Education.

Policy Regarding BYU Foreign Language Achievement Testing Service (FLATS) Brigham Young University’s FLATS program offers testing options for students in a wide range of languages, including many for which Stritch students do not have ready access through Webcape or our own faculty.  Students may use FLATS to   Page 29    demonstrate foreign language competency in a language not supported by WEBcape or Stritch’s Modern Languages and Cultures department and fulfill the university’s foreign language requirement according to the following guidelines:  Students must register for and complete the proctored exam at Stritch, whether administered online or on paper  The student must pass at or above the Second-Semester level to fulfill the requirement  No credit will be awarded for passing the FLATS exam at any level  The exam may be retaken once and in accordance with BYU’s retake policy, requiring a six-month waiting period between attempts.  An official score report must be sent from FLATS indicating the test results.  Students may schedule an exam through the Modern Languages and Cultures department or the office of Prior Learning Assessment.  Foreign Language Placement Examination  A student who has either previous coursework that is unable to transfer or a linguistic background in Spanish, French or German is required to take the WEBcape placement exam.  The exam measures a student’s ability in a foreign language, and the results of the exam place the student in the appropriate course, equal to the student’s level of comprehension. The placement exam may only be taken once and must be taken before students complete their first modern language course at Stritch. Students may not take the exam after taking a course at Stritch because the results will no longer be accepted by the department. If a student takes the exam and places at a level indicating proficiency (third semester placement), the student is considered to have fulfilled the foreign language requirement and will not be required to take any foreign language courses. The Webcape Exam is not a replacement for a foreign language course. It is recommended that students complete their foreign language requirements before they have earned 64 credits for their undergraduate bachelor’s program.  Webcape Score  Placement 0-280 101-level/first semester 281-383 102-level/second semester 384-491 201-level/third semester 492-599 202-level/fourth semester 600 and above Fifth semester and above   Retroactive Credit—Foreign Languages  Retroactive credits may be awarded only by the Modern Languages and Cultures Department.  Students can earn retroactive credits only if they place into a foreign language course higher than the 101 level through the online placement exam and then take that course at Cardinal Stritch University and receive a grade of “B” or higher. The number of retroactive credits earned is determined by the course level at which the student begins foreign language study at the University, and a student can earn a maximum of 14 retroactive credits.   Retroactive credits can be used to fulfill the foreign language requirement. However, if students receive a grade lower than “B” in their first college-level foreign language course (not at the 101 level), they will not earn any retroactive credits.   Retroactive credits count towards the total credits required for graduation.   Culminating Experience A departmental culminating experience successfully accomplished within the student’s respective field of concentration is required of each student in a bachelor’s degree program to fulfill requirements for graduation. This may take the form of a research paper or project, a written or oral examination, a capstone course or some other comprehensive and culminating experience that helps students integrate knowledge about their major field. It rests with the department to decide upon the format of the culminating experience.    Page 30    ACADEMIC POLICIES  Students are bound by the current policies governing all processes in effect during the entire time they are enrolled at Stritch even though the policies may differ from those in place when a student entered the program.   CATALOG YEAR Catalog year determines the set of academic program/curriculum requirements (Core, major, concentration, etc.) that must be fulfilled for graduation. In general, students must meet the degree requirements of the catalog in effect at the time of matriculation. However, if the degree requirements for graduation change, a student may petition to change to a more recent catalog year. A student must meet all the degree requirements for graduation set forth in the newer catalog.  A student cannot qualify for graduation by meeting degree or program requirements from two different catalogs.  To change catalog years, a student should first meet with an advisor to determine whether such a change is in the best interest of the student’s degree plan. The student will be required to submit a catalog year change request form, signed by advisor and program/department chair, to the Office of the Registrar. This form is available to students via an advisor or the Registrar’s Office.  Students who leave the university and apply for re-entry will fall under the catalog policies as outlined under admissions requirements for re-entry students.  These students must submit an appeal letter to the program chair, college dean, and Vice President of Academic Affairs if they wish to request a different catalog year.   Students are held to all other University policies (academic or otherwise) in the current catalog regardless of their catalog year as related to degree requirements.  CALENDAR  The traditional academic calendar is based on a two-semester system, with the first semester beginning in late August and ending before Christmas, and the second semester beginning in January and ending in May.   The interim period between the first and second semester affords interested students an additional block of time for study, field experiences, off-campus internships, participation in programs at other campuses, travel and study abroad. Participation in any interim activities on or off campus is optional.  Most evening and online programs run in 6-week modules with three modules in fall, three in spring, and two in summer.  The first 6-week module in a term usually begins a week prior to the traditional semester start date.     CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS  The following sections detail the specific criteria used for separating Cardinal Stritch University students into class level categories or tuition cost groups.  Class Year Classification (for students who entered as of fall 2013) All students who have been officially accepted to Cardinal Stritch University will be classified according to their number of credits earned. (Developmental courses are not included in this number.) Class year classifications are as follows: Freshmen 0-30 credits  Sophomores 31-60 credits Juniors 61-90 credits  Seniors 91 or more credits   Class Year Classification (for students who entered prior to fall 2013) Freshmen 0-31 credits  Sophomores 32-63 credits  Juniors 64-95 credits  Seniors 96 or more credits  Full-Time and Part-Time Classification Traditional Calendar and Term Degree Programs  The following table indicates the attending status of students in traditional calendar degree programs.   Page 31       Full-Time Half-Time Less than half-time Fall  12+ credits 6-11 credits Fewer than 6 credits  Spring  12+ credits 6-11 credits Fewer than 6 credits  Summer 6+ credits 3-5 credits Fewer than 3 credits  Non-Degree Seeking Students Non-degree seeking students may take up to nine traditional calendar credits per semester at Cardinal Stritch University and fall into the following categories: Personal/Professional Enrichment, Potential Degree Student and Seeking Credit to Transfer. A fourth type of non-degree seeking student is a student enrolled at a foreign institution who is taking coursework at Stritch. Students in this Foreign Exchange category may take more than nine credits per semester. Personal/Professional Enrichment students may continue as non-degree seeking students indefinitely without applying for formal admission to a degree program.  A Potential Degree student may take courses as a non-degree seeking student for two semesters before applying for admission to the University as a regular student. Students classified as Seeking Credit to Transfer are those who are taking courses at Cardinal Stritch University which they intend to apply toward a degree from another institution. These students may take courses as non-degree seeking students for as long as they are enrolled at another institution of post-secondary education.  Non-degree seeking students seeking to take evening/online courses in the College of Business and Management may take a maximum of 12 credits total in this status.  COURSE NUMBERING  The course numbering system identifies upper and lower division courses and is intended to aid students in determining the level of difficulty of courses. Course numbers beginning with 0, such as 010, 011, do not carry credit toward a degree, and grades in these courses are not figured into grade point averages; however, such courses (and their assessed credit value) do count in a student’s semester credit load. Lower division courses are numbered 100-299 and usually are of a general or introductory nature. Upper division courses are numbered 300-499, with the 300 group designating junior level, and the 400 group senior level.   CREDIT LOAD  Traditional Calendar Degree Programs  Credit load is calculated by summing the credit value of each course taken during a traditional semester, with 12-18 credits considered a full load. Additional tuition payment is required for more than 18 credits.  Students who want to carry more than 19 credits must have a 3.0 GPA and special permission from their academic advisor. It is important to note that in order to graduate with 120 credits in four years, a student must take an average of 15 degree credits per semester. If students take fewer than 15 degree credits per semester, they may have to take courses in summers or attend for one or more additional semesters.   Credits earned in directed studies, independent studies, internships or courses which begin at a time other than the regular semester schedule are credited to the credit load of the semester in which they begin.   CREDIT HOUR Department of Education Regulation Definition for Credit Hour An amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than: 1. One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twelve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or 2. At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution, including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.  Cardinal Stritch University Definition of Credit Hour Credit and Time Requirements (always applicable in postsecondary institutions)  Program Lengths a.  Associate degrees require a minimum of 60 semester credits and the equivalent of two academic years. b.  Baccalaureate degrees require a minimum of 120 semester credits and the equivalent of four academic years.   Page 32    c.  Post-baccalaureate degrees require a minimum of 30 semester credits and the equivalent of one academic year and must meet additional credit and time requirements according to degree level and title. d.  Postsecondary professionally-oriented non-degree-granting programs in degree-granting institutions have semester, clock hour, and/or other time requirements commensurate with the subject matter and purposes of specific programs.  A credit hour at Cardinal Stritch University is the amount of work a typical student is expected to complete while meeting all of the learning outcomes of the course at a level of competency.  The amount of work may be dictated by the delivery methods of the course, pedagogy, calendar, discipline, and degree level and typically involves the amount of time on task, academic rigor, complexity of outcome, and resources.  The amount of work completed by the student must be connected directly to the learning outcomes of the course and be verified by evidence of student achievement, e.g., readings, assignments, study team requirements, practicum, homework, classroom attendance, examinations, laboratory work, internships, and supervised studio work.  Credit shall be awarded consistently according to the published credit policies of Stritch and in compliance with the Department of Education standards. Normally, a semester hour of credit represents at least three hours of work each week, on average, for a period of fifteen to sixteen weeks. Correspondingly, a quarter hour of credit represents at least three hours of work each week for a period of ten or eleven weeks. Credit for short-term offerings must be computed on the same basis.  In all cases, faculty contact must be sufficient to ensure the development of knowledge and skills required by each course. Normally faculty contact is greater at the foundation or introductory level.   For colleges and programs offering courses for abbreviated time periods, or in independent study, faculty must ensure that students completing such programs or courses acquire levels of knowledge, competence, and understanding comparable to that expected of students completing work in the standard time period.   All courses at Cardinal Stritch University must comply with the policy of one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for a minimum of fifteen weeks for one semester credit or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time by using commonly accepted educational standards, the work must be verifiable, and the work must be specified in the following three areas, at all levels at the institution (undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral):  1) classroom instruction (in person or online); 2) study team hours (typically outside of scheduled class time); and 3) out-of-class work, such as homework, online work (e.g., CMS), field work, practica, laboratory work, internships, and so forth.  For each of the different levels at the University the expectation is that the work quality and quantity will differ based on learning outcomes.  The traditionally formatted courses at Cardinal Stritch University adhere to #1 definition from the Department of Education and the non-traditionally formatted courses adhere to #2 definition from the Department of Education.    For example for the College of Business and Management students in a three-credit course may spend, at a minimum, 24 hours in course instruction for every three semester hours earned (4 hours weekly x 6 weeks = 24 hours).  Students spend, at a minimum, 24 hours in structured learning team activities for every three semester hours earned (4 hours weekly x 6 weeks = 24 hours).  In addition, “homework” which equals 24 hours per week in addition to class time is expected of the students through the assignments and outcomes, providing approximately 120 hours of study outside of class per course (20 hours weekly x 6 weeks = 120 hours)   Course modules document the learning team and homework requirements.  Each module requires specific, measurable individual student assignments as well as one major learning team assignment.  These published assignments/outcomes document the rigor of the course and have, historically, served to prove that “seat time” comparability exists in each six week course.  In this example, the total number of hours dedicated to a three-credit course is 144 hours.  For the College of Business and Management students in Traditional Semester programs, a three-credit course could meet twice a week for a total of 2.66 credit hours per week. During the 15 week course, the students spends a total of 40 credit hours in class. Each week, there is also a minimum of ten hours of out-of-class student work, for a minimum total of 150 hours of work outside of class during the semester. There are at least 190 total hours of work dedicated to course learning outcomes for the course.   For example, in the College of Arts and Sciences students in a three-credit course may meet in class for one hour each day for three days per week for 15 weeks in the semester for total of 45 hours in class.  In addition, students may be assigned a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work per credit, each week for approximately fifteen weeks during the   Page 33    semester, as verified in the syllabus, for a total of 90 hours of work.  In this example, the total hours of work dedicated to learning outcomes would be 135 hours for the three-credit course.  For example, in the College of Education and Leadership, the doctoral students in a three-credit course may meet for eight hours one weekend per month for 15 weeks, or four total weekends for a total of 30 hours in class.  In addition, students will be assigned a minimum of 6 hours of homework per week (80 hours total) and a minimum of 4 hours of study team work per month outside of class for a total of 20 hours per semester.  In this example, the total hours of work dedicated to the learning outcomes would be 130 hours for the three-credit course.  For example, in the Ruth S. Coleman College of Nursing and Health Sciences, the following guidelines apply: BSN traditionally formatted courses   Meets credit hours as defined: Theory        1 credit = 1 - 50 minute hour Laboratory  1 credit = 2 - 50 minute hours Clinical       1 credit = 3 - 60 minute hours Classes meet for fifteen-50 minutes periods per credit hour.  Laboratory sessions usually receive one credit for 2 contact hours for 100 minutes.  One credit of clinical is equal to 3 clock hours or 180 minutes.  RN to BSN Three and four credit theory: Meets for 6 weeks in the online or blended format.  Three credit courses= 150 hours divided by six weeks= 25 hours per week for class, activities, collaborative learning community work and homework.   Four credit courses include three credits of theory and one credit of clinical.  Clinical time is met through clinical practice experiences that involve key stakeholder input.  Clinical time for one credit equals 150 minutes per credit x 15 weeks in a traditional term that equates to a total of 37.5 hours for one credit and will be fulfilled within a six week course.  Please note that class time whether face to face in the classroom or class time online 50 minutes equals one hour of time and is already calculated into the 150 hours.  MSN Theory  2 credits = 6 weeks x 4 hours per week (24 hours) 3 credits = 8 weeks x 4 hours per week (32 hours)  Practicum 3 credits = 12 weeks (84 hours) – practicum logs document time spent 4 credits = 16 hours (112 hours) – this is part theory and part final graduate/thesis time. (no log kept)  Verification Adherence to the definitions of Credit Hours is verified by the details within the syllabi for each course.  The faculty member, department chair, and College Deans are responsible for oversight and verification of credit hours.  The department chair reviews and evaluates syllabi for all of the courses every semester.  Part of the review includes adherence to the Credit Hour policy.  In addition, the assessment tools and data are utilized (e.g., LiveText) to evaluate if the learning outcomes are being accomplished, thereby adhering to the academic work leading to the award of credit hours.    Directed, Independent Study, and Internship Guidance  Credit hours applicable for a given course or academic experience must be reasonably equivalent to the standard of 3 hours combined direct instruction and student work per week, per credit hour for a 15-week semester.   A 3-credit directed or independent study or internship should require the equivalent of 9 hours of combined direct instruction and student work per week for the equivalent of a 15-week semester. Given that the “course hour” is 50 minutes, this would be a baseline of 112.5 total hours for the course.   Specific directed or independent study and internship guidelines and forms are provided at the school/college from which the course is being taken.  Guidelines at the college/school level may include the number of directed or independent studies (or credits) and internships permitted per student for a single degree.  Course numbers are assigned as the directed or independent study. However, the general standards apply across all academic units and all levels of students.    Page 34    LIVE TEXT STATEMENT Some colleges at Cardinal Stritch University use LiveText (student subscription assessment software) to assist with student learning outcomes assessment for accreditation purposes and continuous improvement of the student experience. Students will be required to purchase a 5-year subscription when they begin their studies at Cardinal Stritch University.  LiveText will allow students to create a portfolio of work that highlights their own growth and improvement in key student learning outcomes specific to their major course of study.  ATTENDANCE  Class attendance is the foundation of the academic experience for students at the University. Student attendance and participation are the essence of all academic programs and an important expectation of faculty. Regular attendance at classes and laboratory sessions is expected. Students are directly responsible for their attendance and for work missed for any reason, including late registration and illness. Each instructor must include in the course syllabus the specific attendance requirements, including any impact absences may have on the course grade.  Some programs may have specific attendance policies (e.g., nursing and teacher education).  Students should refer to their program handbooks for this information.  Students shall not be penalized for excused absences.  Excused absences are defined as classes missed due to participation in official University-sponsored co-curricular events or University-recognized religious observances.  Students are excused from class and are permitted to make up any missed work or exams if they do the following:  Notify the instructor well in advance of the anticipated absence date so that suitable arrangements can be made;  Turn in any work due on the anticipated absence date before that missed class convenes;  Students who have excused absences are advised to obtain class notes/assignments from other students or arrange to have class audio/video recorded by another student.  Students should also realize that any absences may negatively affect “full participation” in class, especially if the class meets only once per week.  Students with excused absences must maintain an adequate performance level in the class.  Co-Curricular Events University-sponsored co-curricular events include athletic competitions, performances in the fine arts, and community engaged experiential learning opportunities (i.e. field trips). Practices and rehearsals are not covered under this policy.  Students must follow the steps above to ensure any of their absences for competitions, performances, and experiential learning are marked as excused rather than unexcused.  Religious Observances For an absence to be excused due to a religious observance, the observance must appear on the University’s official calendar of religious observances.  If it is not on the calendar, the student must request special permission from the dean or designee of his/her college for an excused absence.  Students in these situations must follow the steps outlined above to ensure their absence is excused.  Online Courses Cardinal Stritch University defines attendance in an online course to be meaningful and consistent academic participation at least once a week and comparable to the contact hours that would be required for a similar face-to-face course of similar credits.   Attendance does not include simply logging in. The student must participate in the required or supplemental activity that involves course content (e.g., a discussion, submitting an assignment, or completing a quiz) within the Stritch supported system, such as Canvas or Wolfmail/Stritch mail.   Traditional Calendar Programs  Any short-term absences (one week or less) should be reported to the respective instructors. Any long-term absences (more than one week) should be reported to the respective instructors as well as students’ academic advisors. Students are responsible for any work missed during an absence. Undocumented absence from all courses for more than 14 course meeting days may result in a student being administratively withdrawn from the University. Refer to the Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Attendance policy.  Evening/Online Degree Programs  Any short-term absences (one class period) should be reported to the respective instructors. Due to the format of these programs, extended absences cannot ordinarily be accommodated. Students should contact their respective instructors and academic advisors if extended absences are anticipated. Any undocumented absences of more than two course meeting days may result in a student being administratively withdrawn from the University. Refer to the Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Attendance policy.    Page 35    ADDING, DROPPING A COURSE Traditional Calendar Degree Programs In traditional fall and spring academic terms, a student may drop or add courses online during the first week of classes (Drop/Add period) through My Stritch. Dropped courses will not appear on the student’s academic record. For summer courses and/or courses that are scheduled for less than a full traditional academic term, a student may drop or add courses online prior to the course start date.    Evening/Online Degree Programs In evening and online degree programs, a student must drop and add courses prior to the beginning of each course. There is no designated Drop/Add period. Undergraduate students can drop and add courses online. Dropped courses will not appear on a student’s academic record.  WITHDRAWING FROM A COURSE OR PROGRAM Traditional Calendar Degree Programs After the Drop/Add period, a student may not add or drop a course. For courses scheduled in traditional academic terms, a student may withdraw from a course up to the 2/3 point of course meetings. A student must obtain a withdrawal form from their academic advisor in the Student Success Center. The form must be completed, signed and dated by both the student and the instructor of the course and returned to his/her academic advisor by the end of business hours on the last day for withdrawal as listed on the academic calendar. Once a student withdraws from a course, he/she is not allowed to “sit- in” on the course for content. The recorded date of the withdrawal will be the date the form is returned to their advisor. The student will then receive a grade of “W” for the course.   Withdrawal from all courses is the same as withdrawing from the University. To withdraw from the University, students must contact their academic advisor in the Student Success Center in person or in writing on or before the last date of withdrawal as listed on the semester academic calendar. The recorded date of withdrawal will be the date the academic advisor is notified of the student’s intent. The student will then receive a grade of “W” for all courses.   Evening/Online Degree Programs A student in an evening/online degree program may withdraw from a course up to the 2/3 point of course meetings.   Students should contact their academic advisor for course and program withdrawals. Once a student withdraws from a course, he/she is not allowed to “sit-in” on the course for content. Students will receive a grade of “W” only for course(s) that they were attending at the time of their withdrawal. Any courses scheduled into the future will receive the designation of a dropped course if the student is withdrawing completely from the University.  For all programs, the department chair can set a withdrawal deadline prior to the 2/3 point of a course when appropriate and in consultation with the Registrar’s office.  EMERGENCY/MEDICAL WITHDRAWAL POLICY (STUDENT INITIATED) Purpose Cardinal Stritch University is committed to the academic success and personal growth of its students. There may be times when students experience life situations, medical conditions, or psychological conditions that significantly impair their ability to function successfully or safely in their roles as students. In such situations, time away from the college, used for treatment and recovery, can often restore health and personal wellness to a level that will enable the student to return to the University with the best opportunity for success.   The Emergency Withdrawal Policy provides an opportunity for a student to request time away from CSU for treatment and recovery in hopes of enabling the student to return to Stritch with the best opportunity for future success without negatively affecting his/her GPA.  Policy a. An emergency withdrawal withdraws students from all classes and the residence hall (if appropriate). It is a withdrawal from Cardinal Stritch University.   Withdrawal from an individual course before the last day of class but after the last date to withdraw as listed in the current catalog without academic penalty and before grades are awarded must be authorized by the Dean of the College and the Vice President for Student Affairs. b. A student’s proxy (i.e. parent, guardian, spouse) may request the withdrawal on behalf of the student if the student is unable to request it him or herself.   Page 36    c. Emergency withdrawals are approved on a case-by-case basis and may be granted when:  A physical, mental, financial, or personal issue develops after the last day to withdraw without penalty and is severe enough to keep a student from attending classes and/or successfully completing academic requirements.  A physical, mental, financial, or personal issue develops before the last day to withdraw without penalty, but is not remedied as expected. In this case, students must document that they had been seeking a solution and/or care before the last date to withdraw without penalty; that it was expected that the student would be able to finish the session successfully, but that the expected positive outcome did not occur because reasons out of the control of the student (i.e., not because the student did not follow medical advice, etc.). d. A student is allowed one Emergency Withdrawal per degree during his/her time of study at Cardinal Stritch University. The need for additional emergency withdrawals will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Student Responsibilities In this process, the student is required to: a. Read the Emergency Withdrawal Policy and understand the process for obtaining approval and for returning as a student. b. Meet with the following individuals/departments to discuss any ramifications of an emergency withdrawal on your educational plan: advising/advisor and academic department chair (when applicable) c. Check your health insurance carrier so you can make an informed decision about whether to request an emergency withdrawal. Some health care coverage is dependent on enrollment. d. Complete the Emergency Withdrawal Form (found on the Student homepage in My Stritch) and send to the Director of Student Support within 30 days after the last date of attendance or by the last day of the term/course (in a non-term program). Additionally, supporting documentation from your health care provider must be provided and include the following:   Medical: Written documentation from your health care provider(s) should be on clinic letterhead, describe the diagnosed medical or psychological condition, and indicate when treatment commenced. It should also explain how the condition prevents you from attending classes and completing the semester. If able, the health care provider(s) should address potential health/clinical consequences if a medical withdrawal is not granted. To ensure confidentiality, the health care provider(s) may use a Release of Information form.  Personal (e.g., death in the family, family crisis, etc.): All family emergencies required official and/or notarized forms, documents, or correspondence from a state agency, governmental entity, or reputable business. For example, death of a close family relative requires a death certificate and/or obituary with the name/date of the publication.  Financial (e.g., loss of sole-supporting job, head of household challenges, mandatory job changes): Financial emergencies require the students’ employer or supervisor to document the mandatory change(s), the date of the change(s), and the organizational representative who can verify the circumstance of the job change(s), preferably a human resource professional.   Procedures  a. A student (or proxy) will complete the Emergency Withdrawal Form and send it, along with supporting documentation to the Director of Student Support.  b. The documentation will be reviewed by the Emergency Withdrawal Committee composed of the Director of Student Support, Associate Director of the Wellness Center, and representatives of the Business Office, Enrollment Services, and Financial Aid.  c. Following the granting of an Emergency Withdrawal:  The Director of Student Support will send written authorization of the Emergency Withdrawal to the Registrar, Business Office, Financial Aid Office, Student Life, and Academic and Advising.  The Director of Student Support will notify the student of the emergency withdrawal approval and outline the student’s financial obligations (A medical withdrawal does not dismiss students from their financial obligations with the University).  The Director of Student Support will place an emergency withdrawal hold on the student’s account. d. If a request is denied, the Director of Student Support will send an official denial letter informing the student that he or she may appeal the decision to the Vice President for Student Affairs.  In order to appeal, the student must submit in writing the basis for the appeal and provide evidence to support the reason for the appeal. e. If applicable, students will be required to move out of University housing within 24 hours (unless special arrangements are made with the Dean of Students).  Re-enrollment a. Re-admittance to the University will require the authorization of the Director of Student Support.  b. The student will need to present compelling evidence that the condition or emergency that precipitated the need for an emergency withdrawal has been sufficiently treated or remedied and a plan for continuing good health and/or success is   Page 37    in place to support the student’s transition back to Cardinal Stritch while ensuring the safety of the student and the University community. c. The student must submit a letter requesting reinstatement. The letter with a personal written statement and supporting documentation must be submitted 15 days prior to the beginning of the semester/course (accelerated programs only). (Course registration will not be possible until documentation is received and re-enrollment is granted.) Include the following:  What has the student been doing during time away from Cardinal Stritch?  What has changed for the student that will assist her/him to be successful?  What support systems has the student developed in order to be successful? d. Supporting documentation verifying the emergency has been remedied or the condition has been treated and a plan for continued good health is in place to support the student’s transition back to Cardinal Stritch should be included. For medical withdrawals, documentation must come from the student’s health care provider. e. The student is encouraged to follow up with the Wellness Center upon return to Cardinal Stritch University for assistance in creating and implementing a plan to ensure future academic success and personal wellness. f. The Director of Student Support will contact the Advisor and/or the Academic Department Chair when a student is granted re-enrollment. The Advisor/Chair may request a meeting with the Director of Student Support to create and implement a plan to ensure student success in their particular academic program.  ADMINISTRATIVE WITHDRAWAL  An administrative withdrawal refers to the involuntary withdrawing of students from classes by a faculty member or University administrator. Administrative withdrawals are initiated by officials of the University for compelling reasons, such as registration in violation of University regulations, failure to comply with academic requirements, failure to pay University tuition/fees on time, disciplinary suspension, non-attendance, or other such reasons deemed appropriate by the proper administrative officer. Information regarding administrative withdrawal on psychological, psychiatric or medical grounds may be found in the Administrative Medical Withdrawal policy below. Further information regarding administrative withdrawal procedures and the appeal process is available to students through their academic advisors.  The University reserves the right to administratively withdraw any student whose conduct and/or academic performance is considered unsatisfactory, or whose further attendance is not deemed to be of mutual benefit to the University and the student. For further information, please refer to the section on Academic Policies.   Administrative Withdrawal for Non-Attendance Cardinal Stritch University requires students to attend courses in order to remain a current student.  Students who stop attending some, but not all courses are considered to be “in attendance” at the University and are subject to the withdrawal policies detailed above.    Students who stop attending a course(s) prior to the 2/3 point of the course may be administratively withdrawn by the University and would be assigned a grade of “WU,” unofficial withdrawal. Students who stop attending a course(s) after the 2/3 point of the course may be administratively withdrawn by the University and would be assigned a grade of “WF,” unofficial withdrawal failing, or the earned grade (as assigned by the instructor).   Students who never attend a course (or who never attended all their courses in a traditional 16-week term) and are assigned a grade (WU, WF, F, etc.) in the course(s) have the right to appeal to have the grade(s) changed to a “drop.”  If the appeal is successful, the course(s) will be removed from the student’s record and any tuition charges for the course(s) will be reversed.  Students may submit only one such appeal in their academic career (at each degree level) at the University.  Should non-attendance be an issue in a future course or term, retroactive dropping of the course(s) will not be permitted.  Administrative Medical Withdrawal The following lists the standards and procedures for administrative withdrawal on psychological, psychiatric or medical grounds:   A student may be subject to administrative medical withdrawal from the University, or removal from University housing, if it is determined by the Vice President for Student Affairs (in consultation with the Director of Student Support and the Dean of Students at Stritch, as well as a professional counselor or local mental health care institutions and/or agencies when appropriate) that a student with a mental disorder:   engages or threatens to engage in behavior that poses a danger of causing harm to self or others; or   engages, or threatens to engage in, dangerous conduct that violates an essential provision of the student conduct code.     Page 38    In such cases the Vice President for Student Affairs and the directors referenced above may determine that it is in the best interest of the student and/or the University community for the student to be administratively withdrawn from school. In such cases, the student may be referred for evaluation by an appropriate mental health professional or an independent licensed psychiatrist or psychologist chosen by the institution. Students referred for evaluation in accordance with this procedure shall be informed in writing. A failure to cooperate with the evaluation will normally lead to the determination that the student possesses the capacity to respond to the charge.  A student suffering from a mental disorder who is accused of a disciplinary violation will not be excused from the disciplinary process unless the student lacks the capacity to respond to the charge as a result of the mental disorder.   The student’s withdrawal from the University shall not adversely affect his/her academic standing and record.   Students subject to an administrative medical withdrawal for psychological and psychiatric reasons shall be accorded an informal hearing before the Vice President for Student Affairs and/or the Director of Student Support or Dean of Students as appropriate. This meeting shall consist of a review and explanation for this action with the student and/or parents or guardians of the student if possible. The informal hearing shall be conversational and non-adversarial.   Readmission to the University after an administrative withdrawal for psychiatric or psychological reasons must be requested in writing and approved by the Vice President for Student Affairs.   A student may also receive an administrative withdrawal from the institution for serious medical reasons that do not allow a student to successfully pursue or complete academic coursework. Requests for medical withdrawals of this type should be directed to the Director of Student Support.  MID-TERM AND FINAL EXAMINATIONS In traditional calendar degree programs, mid-term examinations are administered at the discretion of each instructor. Mid-term grades may be available for traditional calendar undergraduate courses and would reflect either an estimated or an actual grade in the course at that time. These evaluations are not part of students’ permanent records but are intended to offer students a formal indication of their standing at mid-term.   Final examinations, final projects and/or presentations are required in all courses except student teaching, seminar, and directed or independent study courses.    Requests to change the time for a final exam will be granted only for legitimate reasons. Students should work directly with their instructor for any request.  GRADES AND QUALITY POINTS  General Grade Information Grades are determined by achievement in coursework, library assignments, course examinations and by fulfilling other criteria set by the instructor. For students taking traditional calendar courses, grades are posted online at the end of each semester. Students in non-traditional programs will have grades posted after completion of each course. The quality of work is indicated as shown below.   A student’s cumulative GPA is calculated using only those credits and grades earned at Cardinal Stritch University. The GPA is computed as follows: the credit hours for each course are multiplied by the quality points earned for each grade received; the quality points for all courses recorded are totaled, and this number is divided by the total number of semester credits graded. All courses are included in the computation except those in which grades of “HP” (High Pass), “P” (Pass), “LP” (Low Pass), “W” (Withdrawal), “WU” (Unofficial Withdrawal), “AU” (Audit), “I” (Incomplete) are received.   For courses that are retaken by a student, the grade awarded for the course the first time it was taken remains on the transcript, but it is not counted toward the GPA. Developmental courses are also not included in the GPA computation, but grades are included on the transcript.   Grade   Quality Points  A    4.00   Superior  A-     3.67  B+    3.33 B   3.00  Very Good  B-   2.67    Page 39    C+    2.33  C   2.00   Satisfactory  C-    1.67  D+    1.33  D    1.00   Poor  D-    0.67  F    0.00  Failure  WF    0.00   Failing Unofficial Withdrawal HP     High Pass, Not Computed P     Pass, Not Computed LP     Low Pass, Not Computed AU     Audit I     Incomplete W     Withdrawal/Administrative Withdrawal WU     Unofficial Withdrawal  Grades in Majors, Minors, Areas of Concentration and Core courses A “major” course is one that has the major departmental designation (e.g., BU or CA) and is listed in the current undergraduate catalog as a requirement for a specific major.   An “auxiliary” course is one that may be required for the major or minor but does not have the major or minor department designation; (e.g., , 113, 120, 195, 196, or any 200-level or higher MT course.  meets the core mathematics requirement for students whose major does not require any other particular mathematics course.  , 315 or 210. In addition to the 22 credits of Mathematics one needs to take  An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking (3 Cr.) This course covers a broader view of mathematics than computation. Topics include inductive and deductive reasoning, patterns in number sequences, logic, set theory and discussions of infinity, systems of numbers, graph theory, explorations in geometry, methods of counting, probability and statistics. The focus of this course is to view the nature of mathematics as an organized, beautiful body of thought. Prerequisite: Placement results or "
MT 120," is a required auxiliary course for business majors.) Auxiliary courses are not counted in the number of required major or minor department credits, unless otherwise stated. In general, grades of “C-” and above are accepted in auxiliary courses unless the individual department establishes a higher minimum grade. Unsatisfactory grades will not be considered for dismissal in the major or minor.  No grade lower than “C-” will be accepted in a student’s major courses, although individual departments may establish a higher minimum grade. A course in which a student earns a grade lower than the minimum acceptable grade may be designated as a general elective, unless the specified course is required for the major. A second unacceptable grade in the major dismisses the student from the major.  A “minor” consists of a number of specified courses determined by each academic department. A student in the general studies associate degree program may choose an “area of concentration” which requires a minimum of 15 credits in one academic area that offers a major or minor. See individual departmental listings.   No grade lower than “C-” will be accepted in a student’s minor or area of concentration although individual departments may establish a higher minimum grade for such courses. If students earn a grade lower than the minimum acceptable grade in a course required for a minor or area of concentration, they may repeat the course only once at Stritch. A second unacceptable grade in the minor or area of concentration dismisses the student from the minor or area of concentration.  The minimum grade accepted for all liberal arts core courses is “D.” A higher grade may be required in some programs. If a students earn a grade lower than the minimum grade accepted in a course required for the liberal arts core, they may repeat this course only once.  Exceptions to this general policy will be made if the course is the only core course specified in a designated area. In this latter case, the students must repeat the course until they earn a minimum acceptable grade.     Courses in which a student earns a satisfactory grade (“C-” or better) may not be repeated for credit as a general rule, unless specifically allowed elsewhere in the undergraduate catalog.   Repeating courses off campus can be allowed under extraordinary circumstances and only with the approval of the Registrar in consultation with the major/minor department. If permission is given, the student should be aware that the Stritch grade will remain on record and is calculated in the GPA. Repeating a course off campus will only fulfill the requirement of the Stritch course.  Grades in Prerequisite Courses Students may meet a prerequisite course requirement by completing one of the following options:  Successfully completing (with a grade of C- or better) a course from a regionally accredited institution. The course must be accepted in transfer and judged by the program as equivalent to the prerequisite course offered by Cardinal Stritch University.   Successfully passing the prerequisite course at Cardinal Stritch University.    Page 40      Note that prerequisites are attached to a course in an attempt to ensure that students are appropriately prepared for success in the course.  A student who passes a prerequisite course with a grade below a “C” may not be sufficiently prepared for that success and should carefully consider retaking the prerequisite course before attempting to move forward.  Students are strongly encouraged to speak with their academic advisors and instructors with any questions or concerns about readiness.  Grades in Developmental Courses Students in any course below the 100 level must pass the course with a grade of “C” or higher; a “C-” does not fulfill this requirement. The grade equivalent must be “C” or higher for a pass in a pass-fail developmental course. Students may repeat a developmental course only once in order to achieve a “C.” The course must be retaken in the following semester with no withdrawals.   A student who does not achieve a minimum grade of a “C” in a developmental course after two attempts will be dismissed from the University. Registration for any pending courses will be cancelled and any tuition paid will be refunded. Students may appeal the decision to the Vice President for Academic Affairs who may refer the appeal to the Undergraduate Academic Standards Committee. The appeal must be made in writing, no later than 30 days after the dismissal has been mailed to the student. If approved, the student is required to retake the course in the following semester with no withdrawals. (See Academic Policies/Academic Dismissal section of the catalog for further information.)   Note: developmental courses do not count toward the 30 credit residency requirement or the 120 total credits required for graduation.   Incompletes Students may be granted a grade of incomplete (“I”) if, through extraordinary circumstances, they are prevented from completing course requirements. In order to be eligible for an incomplete grade, the student must have completed at least 50% of the course work as determined by the instructor. The instructor is not required to grant a student an Incomplete and will do so only at the explicit request of the student. If a student finds it necessary to request an Incomplete in a course, arrangements must be made with the instructor prior to the end of the course. An incomplete contract must be completed by the student and the instructor specifying the work to be accomplished, and the default grade that will be issued if the outstanding work is not submitted by the due date.  The Incomplete contract must be signed by the student as well as the instructor and submitted to the Registrar’s Office.    An incomplete must be removed within six weeks of the last day of the course, although the instructor may set a shorter period. An extension not to exceed one year from the last day of the course may be granted only with written consent from the instructor and the department chair, but if the work is not completed by the end of that year, no further exceptions will be allowed. The instructor is responsible for submitting a replacement grade to the Registrar’s Office. If the instructor does not submit a grade change by the contract date, the registrar is authorized to change the incomplete grade to the grade specified in the contract.  An incomplete is not intended for retaking a course, retaking part of a course, to make up any class time or assignments with a different class at a different time. No instructor is to grant an incomplete unless the student has made this arrangement. Instructors will find the form to request a grade of incomplete from the Registrar’s Office.  Students in the traditional calendar programs may be precluded from eligibility for the Dean’s List if an incomplete extends more than 21 calendar days after the published last day of classes on the academic calendar. The Registrar’s Office will not confer a degree if there is an Incomplete on the student’s record. If a final grade is not received prior to the conferral date, the student must apply for the next conferral date.  ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC OPTIONS Pass-Fail Courses Taking a course “pass-fail” offers students in particular programs the opportunity to explore a new subject area, to broaden their interests, or to allow variety in their curriculum without concern for their grade point average.   Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may opt to take one course each semester on a pass-fail basis (with a grade of “P” or “F” recorded) only if the course is used as an elective. Pass-fail courses may not be used to fulfill any requirements in the liberal arts core or in a student’s major, minor, or area of concentration.     Page 41    To take a course on a pass-fail basis, students must obtain an application from their academic advisor and return the completed form before the add/drop deadline. Once the request has been submitted, the decision is final; the student may not later choose to take the course for a grade. Furthermore, if the student changes a major, minor, or area of concentration and has previously taken a course as pass-fail that is now required, the course cannot be changed to a graded course. The student would have to work out an acceptable alternative with the appropriate academic department. Pass-fail courses with a grade of “P” recorded do not count toward the semester or cumulative grade point average since no quality points are assigned; however, if a grade of “F” is recorded it can negatively impact the grade point average. Students should be aware that pass-fail courses may prevent them from being eligible for the Dean’s List.   To help ensure the use of consistent grading criteria, instructors should not be aware of the pass-fail status of a student. The registrar will assign a “P” or “F” grade to the student based upon the final letter grade assigned by the instructor.   Directed and Independent Study Several departments offer opportunities for student growth in self-motivation and self-education by means of directed study or independent study. A directed study is a self-directed study of an existing course to meet the student’s graduation needs or scheduling conflict.  An independent study is highly individualized study that is not addressable through any other course format through the current curriculum.  Directed and independent studies require the approval of the instructor and department/program chair, and the office of Academic Affairs.  Both directed and independent studies require a syllabus that meets University requirements including the credit hour policy.  If a student’s directed or independent study is added after the add/drop deadline or will bring the student credit load above 18 credits, it can affect his/her bill and financial aid. For more information on directed or independent study, students should see their academic advisors, who will discuss any financial impact and give them the appropriate forms. Students should then contact the chairperson/major advisor to make arrangements and complete the required paperwork.   Auditing Auditing allows students to attend courses without being required to take examinations or to complete projects. A grade of “AU” will be recorded on students’ permanent records instead of credit or a letter grade; audited courses do not count toward the semester or cumulative grade point average, graduation, or a degree.   In most cases, an audited course costs 50% of the regular tuition price per course.  If students wish to take advantage of this discount, they must indicate their intent to audit at the time of registration before the course starts. (The only exception is for students taking traditional calendar courses, who have until the add/drop deadline to change a course status to audit and still receive the discount.)   Students taking traditional calendar courses may change their registration from credit to audit up until the last day to withdrawal from a course for the semester. However, any changes made after the add/drop deadline will not result in any tuition discounts.  Once students have chosen to audit a course, they may not change to credit status after the add/drop deadline has passed.   Internships/Practica/Field Experiences Definition Internships and field experiences are work-related opportunities that allow students to apply classroom learning, theories, and experiences to professional settings, or as defined by special accreditation agencies of the University, e.g., NCATE.  An internship must be approved in writing by a representative of Cardinal Stritch University and provide meaningful learning for the student.  Purpose The Internship/Field Experience Program seeks to provide students with an experience that exposes them to a practical learning experience connected to coursework, while providing students with meaningful responsibilities.  Guidelines The Internship must:  be approved by a representative of Cardinal Stritch University in writing  provide meaningful learning with established learning outcomes that are assessed  provide at least 42 hours of work, or the equivalent, for one academic credit, per semester  be administered in an educational environment  academically benefit the intern   Page 42     ensure that the intern works under close staff supervision, which does not displace regular employees at the business/organization, and a Cardinal Stritch University liaison (e.g., faculty member)  ensure that the intern is not necessarily entitled to a job after the internship  specify if it is to be paid or unpaid; if the internship is paid, the work responsibilities must reflect both the level of pay and learning objectives  Notes:   Internships and field experiences at the University are defined for specific positions and are different than practica and clinical requirements.  Students need to complete an internship form, which outlines the roles and responsibilities for all parties.  The internship/field experience must begin in the same term in which the student registers.  Students must register before beginning the course.  It is the responsibility of the dean for each college to ensure the internship process has been followed appropriately.  Students involved in internships, practica or field experiences are responsible for their transportation to and from the site. Distance to be traveled is a consideration in placements, but the type of experience provided must be the deciding factor.   RESIDENCY CREDIT POLICY Cardinal Stritch University, like most universities, seeks to maximize the number of credits students earn here. This ensures that students absorb as much of the University’s philosophy as possible by interacting with a large number of faculty and staff, thus creating a distinctive Stritch identity for the student. It is a University requirement that the last 30 credits earned for a bachelor’s degree and the last 15 credits for an associate degree be earned at Stritch (residency requirement.)   Developmental courses are not included in this number.   All students must also have a minimum of 12 credits in courses taken at Stritch in the undergraduate major and 9 credits in a minor. Colleges may have residency requirements for the major that are above and beyond this. Program residency requirements are published in each college’s program materials.  The institution must make available the courses that students need to complete their degree requirements once they have begun a specific program of study. If a student was about to graduate and the University was forced to cancel a required course, permission could be given to take the course elsewhere. Under ordinary circumstances, once students have matriculated, they may not take courses at other institutions. Students need explicit permission to take courses at another school and transfer the credits to Stritch. Permission to take courses at another school is granted by the registrar in consultation with the appropriate department and their academic advisor on the basis of need, but will not be granted because of convenience or tuition. If the course is one required in the student’s major sequence, the permission of the department chair is also required. Normally, courses in the student’s major are to be taken at Stritch.   ADDITIONAL MAJORS OR DEGREES Double Majors To achieve a concurrently earned double major, a student must complete the course requirements for both (all) major areas and all core requirements. For students in traditional calendar degree programs, the chairs of the two departments have the discretion to determine whether the senior seminar needs to be taken in both majors. If one seminar is sufficient, the chairs may determine whether fewer than 34 credits are acceptable in the second major. In no case may the second major be fulfilled with fewer than 30 credits. If some courses fulfill requirements for both majors, they will be counted towards both areas. In this situation, a student will earn a single degree with two majors.  For education majors, Student Teaching Seminar taken concurrently with Student Teaching is the Senior Seminar of the Teacher Preparation Program, as it encompasses the licensure practice of both majors.  Two Degrees  To achieve more than one concurrently earned degree, a student must fulfill course requirements for both (all) degrees and all core requirements. If some courses fulfill requirements for both degrees, those courses will satisfy the requirements in both areas.   Completing Additional Major, Minor, or Concentration after Graduation  Alumni of the University who wish to earn a second bachelor’s degree will be considered in-house transfer students. Students will be allowed a maximum of 90 credits toward a second degree. They must fulfill the 30 credit residency and fulfill all core and major requirements as of their entry date.    Page 43     To earn a second major after graduation from Stritch, students will be considered in-house transfer students. As such, they must complete the 30 credit residency and all core requirements as of their reentry date. In this situation, a student will earn two degrees, each with one major, since the first degree has already been conferred.  To earn a minor or concentration after graduation from Cardinal Stritch University, students will not be required to complete the 30-credit residency requirement. In this situation, the student’s new minor or concentration will be noted on the transcript, but he/she will not earn a second degree.  COURSES FROM OTHER POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS  Transfer Credit Policy Transfer students bring a range of learning experiences into their studies at Cardinal Stritch University. The University’s transfer policy recognizes the value of these experiences and awards credit as appropriate to the subject matter and educational goals of the student.  Cardinal Stritch University will accept up to 90 credits in transfer for Bachelor’s degrees and up to 45 credits in transfer for Associate degrees, depending on the requirements of the degree/program. The decision to accept transfer credits is made by the specific major departments and the Registrar. Transfer courses do not automatically fulfill core or major requirements of Stritch. Once credits are accepted in transfer at the University, the credits will be applied to any college based on the college’s major/program requirements.  The following general guidelines apply to all courses taken at other colleges or universities:  Credits will not be accepted for any course with an earned grade lower than a “C-.” This includes “CD,” “Pass/Fail” or “Credit/No Credit.” It should be noted that some major academic departments have higher minimum grades required for courses to fulfill a specific requirement.  Credits will not be accepted for orientation, study skills, pre-college or remedial courses.  Only credits from regionally accredited schools will be considered for direct transfer. Credits from nationally accredited schools will be assessed per the policy described for extra-institutional learning in the various colleges.  Credits transfer; grades do not.  Only grades earned at Cardinal Stritch University will be used to determine a grade point average.  Proficiency exams and Life Experience/Portfolio awards given at other colleges and universities will not be honored at Stritch.  Department approval is required for equivalency to Stritch courses—usually by the department chair. General electives do not require departmental approval.  A maximum of 32 semester hours of technical credit may be transferred in and applied to bachelor’s programs; for associate programs, the limit is 16 semester hours of technical credits.  Students will not be permitted to transfer in technical credits after matriculating at Stritch.  Articulation Agreements Cardinal Stritch University has developed formal agreements with area two-year schools that allow graduates of compatible associate degree programs to apply their credits in or near their entirety to specific Cardinal Stritch University bachelor’s degree programs. A list of programs for which articulation agreements have been developed may be accessed on the Web at http://www.stritch.edu/articulation. Contact the Coordinator of Prior Learning Assessment and Articulation for more information.  CREDIT FOR EXTRA-INSTITUTIONAL LEARNING  Cardinal Stritch University recognizes that learning experiences can occur outside of the traditional classroom setting and that these experiences may be equivalent to college-level learning. There are several programs and methods used to assess such college-level learning and to award credit.   All credits gained through the following programs (excluding study abroad) will be considered “transfer” credits since the learning did not occur at Cardinal Stritch University. Students may earn up to 60 credits in a bachelor’s program through a combination of exams, retroactive credit, military learning and Prior Learning Assessment.   Advanced Placement Examinations (AP)  Advanced Placement Examinations are taken by high school students and demonstrate that college-level knowledge has been gained in a particular academic area. Cardinal Stritch University awards credit for Advanced Placement test scores of 3 and above in keeping with recommendations from the American Council on Education (ACE). The equivalent course for which   Page 44    credit may be applied is determined by the corresponding academic department. Due to licensure and specialized accreditation requirements, some Stritch programs may require higher scores on specific exams in order to grant credit.   In order for a student to receive University credit for any AP exam, students must request that an original transcript from College Board be sent directly to Cardinal Stritch University. Notations of the exam(s) on a high school transcript are not acceptable.   International Baccalaureate (IB) International Baccalaureate diploma programs provide instruction and assessment of learning consistent with college-level learning.  Cardinal Stritch University recognizes IB for its academic rigor and awards credit for learning as demonstrated by acceptable scores on corresponding IB exams.  A score of 4 on Higher Level (HL) exams and 5 on Standard Level (SL) exams is required in order for credit to be granted.  Academic departments determine exact course equivalencies and credit amounts in consultation with the PLA office, which monitors IB for curricular updates and coordinates with departments to ensure continued accuracy of all IB exam credit awards and equivalencies.  Students must provide an official IB transcript to receive credit.  Some academic programs may require higher scores on specific exams to meet licensure and specialized accreditation requirements.    Students awarded the full IB diploma and who earn at least a C or better on the extended essay may earn an additional three (3) credits for , 211, 450).  Check with the department for the complete list.     (minimum grade of “C”),  is determined by placements.

If a student receives a grade lower than “C” in two required and/or elective courses, he/she will be dismissed from the program. No required or elective Psychology course and no required auxiliary course may be retaken more than once.   Page 100     Required grade point average for graduation: A minimum GPA of 2.75 in psychology (required and elective Psychology courses) is required in order to graduate as a Psychology major or minor.  This consists of the six required and all elective Psychology courses for majors and the three required and all elective Psychology courses for minors.  Required grade for  with a minimum grade of “C.”  Major In Sociology With Social Work Training Certificate Preparation: 48 or 51 credits (42 department credits, 6 or 9 auxiliary credits) Required courses for major:  and  and   Sport Management Minor:  18 credits Required courses for minor:  Applied Statistics   Applied Statistics  Applied Statistics  Applied Statistics   For those students interested in taking either the CPA or CMA exams, the following courses are recommended:    Page 122    BUSINESS (BU)The Undergraduate School offers three majors leading to Bachelor of Arts degrees in a traditional semester format — Accounting, Business, and International Business, and one major leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing.  In all four majors, students are required to complete an internship.   The Business major provides the opportunity to develop the foundational skills necessary to be competitive in many different management positions in both the private and public sectors. The students will learn to apply organizational and management theories, and quantitative techniques to interpret and analyze business situations.   A student in any of the departmental majors in the College of Business may not minor in one of the other two programs, nor may a student graduate with more than one of these majors. Only minors or second majors from departments in other colleges will be accepted.

In all four majors, students are required to complete an internship.   The International Business major is designed to prepare the student for an entry-level position in a firm engaged in international business. An additional year of foreign language study and the completion of a semester study abroad are required for International Business majors.   A student in any of the departmental majors in the College of Business may not minor in one of the other two programs, nor may a student graduate with more than one of these majors. Only minors or second majors from departments in other colleges will be accepted.  Transfer students enrolled in any of the three majors must take at least 15 Stritch credits in the department including .    Plus the following requirements:  one semester of an international study abroad, foreign language and internationally related social science and humanities courses.  International study or field experience: (academic at institution of higher learning) during the junior or senior year. The program will be worked out with the student’s business advisor. International Business majors must also demonstrate proficiency in a foreign language. This can be accomplished by taking two (or more) advanced courses in language (200 level or above) and earning a grade of “C-” or better; or it may be demonstrated through CLEP examination, transfer credits, or other approved methods of certification as determined by the department chair. (6 credits) Two appropriate internationally related courses from social science and humanities areas are required.  These courses may be chosen in consultation with the student’s business advisor and may also count for the student’s liberal arts core requirement.

EN 102,".  College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and DSST  CLEP and DSST tests cover material that is commonly taught in introductory-level college courses. Through these exams, students can demonstrate acquired college-level learning in a subject area and earn undergraduate credit. Credits are awarded based on American Council on Education (ACE) recommendations. The equivalent course for which credit may be applied is determined by the corresponding academic department. Due to licensure and specialized accreditation requirements, some Stritch programs may require higher scores on specific exams in order to grant credit. Information on Stritch policies and acceptable scores may be accessed at www.stritch.edu/pla or by contacting the Coordinator of Prior Learning Assessment and Articulation. Credit may only be awarded upon receipt of an official test score report from the corresponding testing program.   Departmental Examinations  Departmental examinations are used by academic departments to verify that sufficient competency and/or proficiency has been achieved in a particular course and for which standardized national tests do not exist. Individual academic departments of the University decide whether or not a specific departmental course can be challenged by exam and set a maximum limit on the number of credits students may earn in their major through these means. Departmental exams exist for a limited number of courses. Students may contact the specific academic department for further information.   Courses from Nationally Accredited Schools  Transfer of credit will not be determined solely on the basis of accreditation. Credits earned from nationally (non-regionally) accredited schools may be eligible for direct transfer if they were earned from a degree-granting school recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA) and the U.S Department of Education (DOE), were measured in quarter or semester units, and meet the Cardinal Stritch University grade and content criteria for transferability. Students must have earned these credits prior to enrolling at Stritch. Up to 60 credits may be applied to a bachelor’s degree from degree-granting, nationally accredited schools. At the time of application, students should have all official transcripts sent to Stritch for evaluation.   United States Armed Services Records/Military Learning  The Military Education Program, working in cooperation with the American Council on Education (ACE) and the Department of Defense, assists service men and women in achieving recognition for college-level learning acquired in military life. The University will evaluate and award credit from the military (Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Navy, Department of Defense, etc.) by applying current transfer policy to ACE credit recommendations.   At the time of application, students who are or have been members of an armed services branch should have an official Joint Services Transcript (JST) sent to Stritch for review. (Air Force veterans should request official transcripts from the Community College of the Air Force (CCAF), which is a regionally accredited institution.)  Additional support documentation may include Forms DD214, 225, or 259, if applicable. A maximum of 60 of the combined 60 credits allowable for all extra-institutional learning may be awarded directly from ACE military transcript recommendations.  Prior Learning Assessment (PLA)    Page 45    Students who have completed significant corporate training programs, earned professional licenses and certificates, or completed other formal learning may have their learning evaluated for credit. The Prior Learning Assessment (PLA) portfolio is a presentation of documents that support formal, adult, college-level learning. Cardinal Stritch University evaluators review portfolios and can award credit for college-level theoretical learning shown in the documentation. Students who feel they have mastered college-level theory but cannot document formal training in the portfolio format may present their learning for assessment through experiential essays.   A maximum of 36 credits at the bachelor’s level can be earned through any combination of PLA portfolio and essay awards. Contact the Coordinator of Prior Learning Assessment and Articulation for specific processes, materials, and guidance at www.stritch.edu/pla.   Study Abroad  Cardinal Stritch University offers access to many study abroad programs. Information for participating in such programs can be obtained through the Student Life. Students will receive full credit for any courses that are satisfactorily completed while abroad as long as those courses are pre-approved by the appropriate academic departments at Stritch. Information about offerings and procedures can be obtained by contacting the Coordinator of International Education and Study Abroad.  In addition, enrollment in a semester-long study abroad program approved for credit by Cardinal Stritch University may also be considered enrollment for purposes of applying for federal student financial aid. Specific information about the financial aid process as it relates to study abroad can be obtained by contacting the Financial Aid Office.  ACADEMIC DIFFICULTIES: WARNING, PROBATION AND DISMISSAL A minimum cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 is required for the successful completion of all undergraduate degrees. Certain degree programs require a grade point higher than 2.0 as noted in the departmental sections. If a student’s academic performance becomes unsatisfactory, the department and/or the institution will take disciplinary action.   Academic Warning  When a student’s semester grade point average falls below 2.0 but the cumulative grade point average remains above 2.0, the student is placed on Academic Warning. Students will be required to discuss their academic status with an academic advisor in the Student Success Center and the chair in their major’s department, who will make appropriate suggestions to help the students remedy their academic difficulty. Students on Academic Warning are subject to the following terms:  Students may carry no more than 15 credits per semester  Students must meet with their academic advisor prior to registering for classes.   Academic Probation  When their cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0, students are placed on Academic Probation. Academic Probation will be noted on the student’s transcript, as will removal from probation. Students on Academic Probation are subject to the following terms:   Students may carry no more than 13 credits per semester.   Students must meet with their academic advisor prior to registering for classes.   Students are not eligible to participate in major extracurricular activities, such as intercollegiate sports, student government, or theatrical productions. However, a student on academic probation may be permitted restricted participation in extracurricular activities by mutual consent of the department chair or Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs. In such cases, an academic performance contract is written and presented by the Vice President for Student Affairs and must be strictly adhered to by the student.   If students leave the institution for a semester or more after being placed on Academic Probation, they will return on Academic Probation.  Academic Dismissal  Students will be subject to Academic Dismissal from the University under the following conditions (based on credits attempted at Stritch):   Students receive at least three failing grades (“F” and/or “WF”) in one grading period or two consecutive grading periods, including fall semester, spring semester and summer session.   Their cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters, excluding the summer sessions. This policy is intended to benefit the student who does satisfactory work in the summer session, but is not able to bring up the cumulative grade point average to 2.0 in the summer session by itself.   Page 46     Students are on probation and withdraw or leave the institution for a semester or more, and the cumulative grade point average remains below 2.0 in the semester in which the students return.   Students are on probation and the cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0 in the next semester, excluding the summer session.   Students do not achieve a minimum grade of “C” in a developmental course below the 100 level after two attempts.  Students who are granted conditional or probationary admission and do not fulfill the conditions or academic criteria required by their admission status.  Students who are in an accelerated/cohort degree program in the College of Business and Management who receive three failing grades (“F” and/or “WF”).  A student who has been dismissed from the University has the right to appeal for reinstatement. This appeal must be made in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs no later than 30 days after the letter of dismissal has been mailed to the student. The Vice President for Academic Affairs may refer appeals to the Undergraduate Academic Standards Committee. The student is strongly urged to appear in person before the Academic Standards Committee to present the appeal. The student may bring one other person as support to the appeal hearing, although this person may not take part in the discussion. The committee may use input from the department and/or instructor in making its decision. The decision of the committee is forwarded in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who informs the student. In matters of Academic Dismissal, the decision of the committee is final.   Students who have been readmitted to the University after receiving a grade of “C” in a developmental course after two attempts must retake the course in the semester in which they return, with no withdrawals.  ACADEMIC GRIEVANCES  If students feel that there is sufficient reason to question a final course grade or an academic disciplinary action, they may initiate a formal appeal process. Grievances of an academic nature should be handled at the department level, beginning with the instructor. This appeal must be made in writing to the instructor no later than 30 days after the final course grades have been posted. If the grievance is not settled with the instructor, the student should make the complaint in writing to the appropriate department/program chair, and associate dean where applicable, no later than 10 days after receiving the instructor’s written decision.  The department/program chair and associate dean will inform and consult the college dean on all academic grievance matters.  If the matter is not settled at the college level, the student may bring a final appeal to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.  Such appeals must be made in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs no later than 15 days after having received the written decision of the college.  The Vice President for Academic Affairs may refer grade appeals to the appropriate Academic Standards Committee.   In appeals for the change of a course grade, the student and the academic person concerned are strongly urged to appear before the committee when the case is presented. Each may bring one other person as support to the appeal hearing, although this person may not take part in the discussion. The Undergraduate Academic Standards Committee does not have the authority to change a course grade but may recommend that the instructor re-evaluate the situation. The committee’s recommendation is forwarded in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who informs the student and department/program chair, and associate dean where applicable, of the department/college in which the course was taken.   A student dismissed from the major/program, minor, or area of concentration for unacceptable grades may petition the department for readmission no later than 30 days after the letter of dismissal has been mailed to the student. The petition must be in writing. It is the department’s decision to readmit the student or not and/or to place any conditions on the readmission. Appeals of the department’s decision must be made in writing to the college dean to whom the department reports. The college dean, in consultation with the department, may make the final decision and inform the student of the outcome of his/her appeal.   ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  General Policy  Inherent in the mission of Cardinal Stritch University is the strong belief in the principle of academic integrity. Students’ actions reflect their moral character and, by extension, the University’s reputation. Therefore, all students are expected to recognize and to abide by the following policy whether attending courses in-person or online. It is a major responsibility of students and faculty to promote academic integrity. Violations include cheating, plagiarism, fabrication and other academic misconduct.   Cheating    Page 47    Students who cheat violate their integrity and the integrity of the University by claiming credit for work they have not done and knowledge they do not possess. Examples of cheating include copying answers from another’s work; permitting someone else to copy answers from their own work; using books, class notes, or any other means or devices to obtain answers to a question when not allowed; and submitting substantially the same work for more than one course.   Plagiarism  Plagiarism is the use of someone else’s words, ideas or other work without proper documentation. Students who plagiarize violate their integrity and the integrity of the University by laying claim to work that is not their own. Students should be aware that even when they do not intend to plagiarize, they might still be technically guilty of academic misconduct if they fail to document their sources properly. Both intentional plagiarism and inaccurate documentation are threats to the integrity of the student and the University because clear thinking and responsible work depend on careful treatment of evidence, respectful treatment of other writers and courteous treatment of one’s readers.   Examples of plagiarism include copying words, sentences or passages from a text, such as an internet source, book, magazine, newspaper, pamphlet, paper of another student, or paper prepared by anyone other than the student who submits the paper, without indicating the source of those words, sentences, or passages; using quotations without copying them correctly; paraphrasing or summarizing another writer’s ideas, even if one does not quote the writer directly, without giving credit to that writer; failing to give adequate bibliographical information to the reader who may need to refer to the source the writer has used; using graphs, charts, tables or other visual aids without giving credit to the source from which they were taken; and downloading and using any part of an oral presentation from a Web site without documentation or even with documentation if the entire presentation comes from that website. Students should know that documentation formats (APA, MLA, Turabian) vary from department to department, and they should consult the faculty about documentation specifics.   Fabrication  Fabrication is an intent to deceive members of the academic community through inventing information or creating the illusion of having acquired or mastered information. Fabrication can be recognized in these examples: listing bibliographic references not used; citing information not taken from the source indicated; falsely claiming to have completed a clinical, internship, field experience or course prerequisite; inventing data, materials or sources for academic assignments; taking a quiz or other examination for someone else or permitting someone else to be tested on one’s behalf; submitting another person’s work as if it were one’s own (written, illustrated, tabulated, etc.); submitting substantially the same work for more than one course; and not doing one’s agreed upon share of work in group projects.   OTHER ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT  Academic misconduct is generally understood to be any intentional violation of academic policies by which students misrepresent their achievements or interfere in some way with the grading process.  Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to collusion in activities such as entering University property to obtain un-administered tests or changing grades; stealing, buying or selling parts of an un-administered test; bribing or accepting bribery for advance information about tests.   Action and Appeal  Because breaches of academic integrity vary in degree and seriousness, actions taken against violations will, in some cases, be left to the discretion and judgment of the individual faculty member. If requested, the dean to whom the college reports will serve as a referee or mediator in any case.   When a faculty member finds cause to act upon a violation of academic integrity, the student will be notified within ten academic business days of the charge. The faculty member or designee and the student will then meet to discuss the violation and the action to be taken. Possible actions that can be taken include, but are not limited to, the following:   resubmission of an equivalent, but not identical exam, paper, project, etc.;   a grade of “F” or “zero” on the exam, paper, project, etc.;   failure of the course.   The faculty member will then submit in writing a description of the violation and the action taken against the student to the following parties: the chair of the department in which the violation occurred, the department chair of the student’s major, the dean of the college in which the violation occurred, and the Vice President for Academic Affairs. This document will be placed in a file maintained by the office of the Vice President for Academic Affairs.   The student may appeal in writing the faculty member’s decision or action to the dean of the college in which the violation occurred within 15 academic business days after notification of the violation. This written appeal should include evidence to substantiate the student’s case. Within five academic business days of receiving the appeal, the dean will arrange to meet with   Page 48    the faculty member and the student to work out a solution. If an agreement cannot be reached, the dean will decide upon a course of action and inform both the student and the faculty member in writing within five academic business days of the meeting.   If the student or faculty member wishes to appeal the decision of the dean, an appeal can be made in writing, within 15 academic business days after notification of the decision, to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who will submit the case to the Undergraduate Academic Standards Committee. This committee will make the final decision in the matter.  Serious Violations  Upon evidence of any serious and substantiated violation of academic integrity, the Vice President for Academic Affairs will convene an ad hoc group including the chair of the department in which the violation occurred, the department chair of the student’s major, the dean of the college in which the violation occurred, and the faculty member who documented the violation. The group will consider the infraction and decide upon the action to be taken against the student, which may include dismissal from the University. The Vice President for Academic Affairs will notify the student in writing of the action taken, as well as the deans, the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Registrar. Within 15 academic business days after notification of the decision, the student may appeal the decision in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who will submit the case to the Undergraduate Academic Standards Committee. This committee will make the final decision in the matter.   Multiple Violations  Upon evidence of more than one violation of academic integrity by a single student, the Vice President for Academic Affairs will convene an ad hoc group including the chair of the department in which the violation occurred, the department chair of the student’s major, the associate dean where applicable, the dean of the college in which the violation occurred, and all faculty members who had documented violations. The group will consider the infractions and decide upon the action to be taken against the student, which may include dismissal from the University.   The Vice President for Academic Affairs will notify the student in writing of the action taken, as well as the deans, the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Registrar. Within 15 academic business days after notification of the decision, the student may appeal the decision in writing to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, who will submit the case to the Undergraduate Academic Standards Committee. The decision of the committee is final.  STUDENT CONDUCT CODE  Cardinal Stritch University is committed to the holistic development of each of our students. The University strives to preserve an environment that is conducive to academic pursuit, social growth and individual discipline for all of its students. Students are expected to behave in a superior moral and ethical manner, both on and off campus. Respect for oneself, others, property and authority, as well as honesty, are key elements in this behavioral expectation. It is essential that mutual respect for, and sensitivity to, the needs of others be accepted by all members of the University community in accordance with the Franciscan values of Cardinal Stritch University.   All students are expected to act responsibly and within the regulations and standards established by the University, and all civil laws and ordinances. The University reserves the right to hold accountable those whose conduct is in violation of the following regulations on or off campus.   Conduct which is subject to disciplinary action or response by the University includes, but is not limited to, the following:  1. Cheating, plagiarism or any form of academic dishonesty as specified in the Academic Integrity Policy.  2. Forgery, alteration or misuse of campus documents, records, time-cards, or identification; knowingly furnishing false information to the University.  3. Self-destructive behaviors which impede an individual's ability to properly pursue his/her education or obligation as a student at Cardinal Stritch University.  4. Misrepresentation of oneself or of an organization to be an agent of the University.  5. Obstruction or disruption, on or off campus property, of the academic process, administration process, or other campus functions.  6. Threatening to, or inflicting, physical or psychological violence to the person or property of others, including their family members or campus visitors.  7. Theft, intentional destruction, damage or unauthorized possession/use of University property or of the property of others, including their family members or campus visitors.  8. Unauthorized entry into, unauthorized use of, or misuse of any building, structure, equipment or facility.  9.

Abuse of, or tampering with fire alarm or security systems, fire emergency equipment or any other emergency equipment.  14. Sexual or physical harassment or assault, or psychological harassment of any individual (inclusive of incidents of dating violence, domestic violence and/or stalking). See the Sexual Harassment and Misconduct Policy. 15. Engaging in degrading, lewd, indecent or obscene behavior.  16. Failure to comply with directions of or acting disrespectfully towards University officials, designated agents, law enforcement, or others in authority in the performance of their duties.  17. Conduct which adversely affects a student’s suitability as a member of a respectful academic community. Students are required to engage in responsible social conduct that reflects credit upon the University community and to model good citizenship in any community.  18. Use of technology in an unauthorized way. This includes, but is not limited to sharing or distributing music in a manner that violates copyright laws; attempting to gain access to another’s email account; use of another individual’s identification and/or password; making changes to another’s private files, or impersonating another individual; knowingly transmitting viruses, chain mail, or spam; using software that overloads the network; sending or posting illegal, defamatory, harassing, pornographic, obscene, or patently offensive sexual materials in email, web pages, individual newsgroup postings, or other electronic forms of communication.  19. Hazing, defined as an act which endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student, or which destroys or removes public or private property, for the purpose of initiation, admission into, affiliation with, or as a condition for continued membership in a group or organization. The express or implied consent of the victim will not be a defense. Apathy or acquiescence in the presence of hazing are not neutral acts; they are violations of this rule.  20. Abuse of the Student Conduct Process including, but not limited to:   Failure to obey the notice from an Administrative Hearing Officer or Student Conduct Committee to appear for a meeting or hearing as a part of the Student Conduct Process.   Providing false information pertaining to a student conduct meeting.   Disruption or interference with the orderly conduct of an Administrative Hearing Officer or Student Conduct Committee proceeding.   Attempting to discourage an individual’s proper participation in, or use of, the student conduct process.   Attempting to influence the impartiality of a member of a Student Conduct Committee prior to, and/or during the course of, the Student Conduct proceeding.   Harassment (verbal or physical) and/or intimidation of any individual, including witnesses, during, and/or after a student conduct proceeding.   Failure to comply with the sanction(s) imposed under the Student Conduct Code.   Influencing or attempting to influence another person to commit an abuse of the Student Conduct Code and process.  More information about the Conduct Code, including procedural information, can be found in the Student Handbook.   DISRUPTIVE/THREATENING BEHAVIOR POLICY Disruptive Behavior  Cooperation and mutual respect are imperative in creating and maintaining an effective learning environment where all enrolled students can receive the maximum value of the higher education experience. It is vital that student and faculty actions in University settings or activities model behaviors that promote a positive learning environment. It is the responsibility of both the students and the faculty members to ensure that disruptive behaviors do not occur.   Stating unpopular opinions relating directly to the topic under discussion is not disruptive behavior, provided it is done in a respectful manner.   Examples of disruptive behavior include, but are not limited to the following: consistently speaking without being recognized; interrupting other speakers; distracting the class from the subject matter or discussion, which may include inappropriate cell phone use; harassing behavior or personal insults; failing to maintain civility in discussions; engaging in side conversations; using the computer for non-class related functions; bringing un-enrolled parties to class, except in the case that a guide is permitted due to a disability accommodation; or refusing to comply with the directions of the faculty member.   These behavioral expectations as outlined above are also applicable to other campus settings; e.g., Library, cafeteria, etc.    Page 50     Some disruptive students may have emotional or mental disorders. Although such students may be considered disabled and are protected under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, they are expected to meet the same standards of conduct as any student. It is important that the faculty members establish the standards for their classroom and enforce them for all students.   Threatening Behavior  Threatening behavior is defined as “any statement, communication, conduct or gesture, including those in written form, directed toward any member of the University community that causes a reasonable apprehension of physical harm to a person or property. A student can be guilty of threatening behavior even if the person who is the object of the threat does not observe or receive it, so long as a reasonable person would interpret the maker’s statement, communication, conduct or gesture as a serious expression of intent to physically harm (U of Arizona).”   Campus security (at the Fox Point/Glendale campus) will generally be called for threatening behavior; however, 911 should be called first if the threat of harm is imminent.   Threatening behavior must be reported to Security, the Student Affairs (specifically the Vice President for Student Affairs and/or the Dean of Students), and the Dean of the college in which the threat occurred. An incident report must be completed within 24 hours and forwarded to Student Affairs, Security, and the College Dean, and a copy retained by the filing employee. In a case in which the threat is made about, but not to, an individual, that individual will be notified as soon as possible by Security.   Irrespective of law enforcement action, members of the Student Affairs will investigate complaints against students and will keep records of such complaints and investigations. The Vice President for Student Affairs may require a mental health assessment at the student’s expense.   Threatening incidents will be handled by the Student Affairs in a manner consistent with other violations of the student code of conduct as outlined in the Student Handbook. The University reserves the right, in appropriate cases, to suspend the student temporarily, pending determination of a hearing. The threatened person, Security, and the Dean of the college in which the threat occurred, will be notified of the outcome of the case.   After a decision has been made, either the person who made the threat or the threatened person may file an appeal with the Vice President for Academic Affairs. The appeal must be made in writing with specific reasons stated as to why the individual believes an appeal is in order. An appeal must be made within 10 working days from the time the student is notified of the committee’s decision. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs will be final.   If an appeal is filed, that appeal shall not result in a modification of the decision while an appeal is pending.  Response and Intervention  Students are expected to contribute positively to the classroom environment. That includes, but is not limited to, being on time and attentive during class, contributing in a respectful manner to the topic under discussion, and silencing all cell phones and pagers.   If faculty members ask students to discontinue behavior that they feel is disruptive, students are expected to do so, even if the students do not agree with the faculty members’ assessment. Students should not discuss it in front of the class, as that will likely escalate the situation. Rather, the students are encouraged to arrange an appointment to talk privately with faculty members.   If the disruption continues, a faculty member may ask the disruptive student to leave class. If that request is made, the student should do so quietly and without incident. In that situation, it is suggested that the student speak to or submit a written account of the incident to the Dean of Students as soon as possible.   A disruptive classroom situation may result in informal mediation, a formal contract between the student and the University outlining expected behaviors, a counseling referral, or a disciplinary action. Disciplinary action can result in a variety of sanctions including, but not limited to, disciplinary probation, behavioral requirements, suspension, or expulsion.   If a student is disturbed by another student’s behavior, the student is encouraged to speak with that student or the faculty member to explore strategies to resolve the issue. If the issue remains unresolved, the student who is being disturbed by another student’s behavior is encouraged to speak with the chair of the department in which the course resides.    Page 51    GRADUATION AND COMMENCEMENT   Graduation is the culmination of a student’s academic experience resulting in the conferring of a degree. Cardinal Stritch University confers degrees in May, August and December. Students are eligible for graduation when they have met all academic degree requirements and have submitted an application for diploma.   Commencement is the formal ceremony that celebrates the achievement of graduation.  Students are eligible to participate in commencement once they have fulfilled all academic degree requirements and have met all financial obligations to the University. Students are not required to participate in commencement in order to graduate but are encouraged to do so.   GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS  Policies governing graduation requirements cannot be changed once a student has matriculated into a program. Graduation requirements are the final set of conditions which a student must meet in order to graduate from the University.   Students are candidates for an associate degree when they have:   Earned a minimum of 60 semester hours of credit and a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in courses taken at Cardinal Stritch University (nursing students must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.25 in courses taken at Cardinal Stritch University);   Fulfilled the minimum general education requirements;   Fulfilled the requirements of their respective course sequence;   Adhered to University’s Residency Credit Policy  Been recommended by faculty vote;   Met all student responsibilities for the University outcomes assessment program; and   Applied for diploma   Students are candidates for a bachelor’s degree when they have:   Earned a minimum of 120 semester hours of credit with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in courses taken at Cardinal Stritch University (nursing students must have a cumulative grade point average of 2.25 in courses taken at Cardinal Stritch University.);   Fulfilled the minimum general education (core) requirements;   Fulfilled the course requirements of the major department;   Successfully completed their Senior Culminating Experience;   Fulfilled the Franciscan Core requirements (as required by their degree);   Adhered to University’s Residency Credit Policy  Been recommended by faculty vote;   Met all student responsibilities for the University outcomes assessment program; and   Applied for diploma   The Registrar’s Office will not confer a degree if there is an incomplete on the student’s record. If a final grade is not received prior to the conferral date, the student must apply for the next conferral date.  APPLICATION FOR DIPLOMA  It is the responsibility of the student wishing to graduate to file an application for diploma. The deadline for filing this application is March 1 for May graduation of the same academic year, August 15 for August graduation of the same academic year, and October 1 for December graduation of the same academic year. All degree-seeking students must apply for their diploma in order to graduate from the University even if not participating in the commencement ceremony. Diplomas are mailed approximately two months after the graduation date. Diplomas and final and official transcripts will not be mailed or released to graduates who have financial obligations to the University.   If students cannot fulfill their degree requirements, they must formally withdraw their application for diploma. Students must then reapply for a subsequent graduation date. It is the students’ responsibility to complete a new application and submit it by the appropriate deadline for the new anticipated graduation date.  PARTICIPATION IN COMMENCEMENT  The University holds a single commencement ceremony in May of each year in the Milwaukee area.  Any associate, bachelor’s, or master’s degree seeking student not having met all graduation requirements at the time of commencement, but still wishing to participate in the ceremony, must meet the following conditions:    Page 52      Students must have all degree requirements met by the August degree conferral date of the same year they wish to participate   Students must have no more than six credits left to complete their degree requirements  Students in the Undergraduate Teacher Education program must have completed all coursework except student teaching and associated portfolio courses  Students must have met all current financial obligations or entered into a payment plan at the time of application to participate in commencement.  Students must complete a “Request for Permission to Participate in Commencement Only” form that includes a printed and signed academic advisor-approved completion plan/advising worksheet identifying all courses that will be taken off campus or completed through CLEP or portfolio with anticipated completion dates, and written approval to take any courses off campus.  Students must file an “Application for Diploma” for the August graduation date to fulfill graduation requirements (Students in the Undergraduate Teacher Education program must file for the December graduation date)  Note: if approval is granted, it is for permission to walk across the stage at commencement, not the conferral of a degree. Participation in commencement or listing of a student’s name in a program does not guarantee degree conferral.  Doctoral degree candidates must have successfully completed all required coursework and met all program requirements as defined by the department in order to participate in the commencement ceremony.  All doctoral candidates must have met the appropriate graduate application deadline.  Student Commencement Speaker Graduating students may participate in an application process to be considered as the student commencement speaker. Application materials are provided to graduating students in all programs.   ACADEMIC HONORS  Graduation Honors  There are three grades of honors conferred at graduation for students who have earned at least 61 credits at Cardinal Stritch University in a bachelor’s program: Cum Laude (with distinction), Magna Cum Laude (with great distinction) and Summa Cum Laude (with highest distinction). To be eligible for these honors, the student must have attained a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.5, 3.7 and 3.9 respectively. These Latin honors are based on final grades and appear on the student’s final transcript and diploma.  The honor of Academic Distinction will be conferred at graduation for students who have earned between 30 and 60 credits at Cardinal Stritch University in a bachelor’s program and have attained a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.5.   Students participating in the commencement ceremony will wear honors cords as part of their academic regalia if they have achieved any of these levels of distinction:  Cum Laude and Academic Distinction (one cord), Magna Cum Laude (two cords), and Summa Cum Laude (three cords).   May graduates are given cords based on their cumulative GPA as of fall given that all final grades for spring semester are not submitted by the day of commencement.  However, actual honors are still awarded based on all final grades.  Dean’s List  The Dean’s List is made up of those students who have attained a grade point average of 3.5 or higher in any semester. To be eligible, a student must have carried at least 12 credit hours taken in a semester for letter grades.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of a student's educational records. It limits the type of student information that may be released without a student's permission. It also helps to ensure accuracy in any educational records that are maintained on a student.  What are a student's rights under FERPA? FERPA grants four central rights to students related to those records, files, documents, and other materials that contain information directly related to them that are maintained by the University.   The right to inspect and review education records maintained by the school;  The right to seek to amend these records;  The right to have some control over the disclosure of information from these records; and  The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning an allegation that the institution has failed to comply with the Act.  If students believe anything in their record is inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise violates their rights, students have the right to challenge the content of those records. If students’ suggested corrections are not made by the University, students may insert into their records a written explanation regarding the contents of such records.  The students' access and review are subject to the following conditions:  The University has 45 days to comply with students’ written requests to review their records.  All information declared confidential by the act is not available for inspection.  After reviewing their records, students may request that the unit maintaining the record remove or modify the information they believe is misleading, inaccurate or inappropriate. If students’ requests are refused, they may insert in their records a written explanation regarding the contents to which they object, or file an appeal with the President's Office, which will be heard by a person or committee designed by the President.  What information may be released without a student's permission? The following information is construed to be directory information, which may be released to the public without a student's permission.  Name  Address  Telephone listing  E-mail address  Date and place of birth  Major field of study  Participation in officially recognized sports and activities  Weight and height of members of athletic teams  Dates of attendance  Degrees and awards received  The most recent educational agency or institution attended  Photograph  Even though this information is deemed to be public information, all students have the right to inform the University that any or all of the above information should not be released without their prior consent. If students wish to restrict the release of information, they must complete a written request to that effect to the Registrar's Office. After the student has filed the required written request, the University will notify the appropriate offices and begin to comply with the request as soon as possible. The request is effective for the duration of the academic year for which it was requested.   What are the conditions under which other student information may be released without permission?  Release to school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position; a person or company employed by or under contract to the University to perform a special task, such as an attorney or auditor; a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee or a faculty/student committee; or a   Page 55    student worker. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an educational record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for the University.   Release to officials of another school, in connection with a student's efforts to enroll.  Release to federal and state educational officials, in connection with certain audits.  In connection with a student's request for or receipt of financial aid.  Release to federal, state and local law enforcement officials, in connection with certain criminal investigations.  Release to organizations conducting studies for or on behalf of educational agencies or institutions.  To accrediting organizations to carry out their functions.  Release to parents of a student who is their "dependent" within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.  To comply with a judicial order, lawfully issued subpoena, or in the case of legal action between the University and the student or student’s family.  To appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency.  Release of directory information (see section above for details on what Cardinal Stritch University designates as directory information).  To the student.  The results of any disciplinary proceeding conducted by the University against an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence to the alleged victim of that crime.  Parents of students younger than twenty-one years old may be contacted when students use or possess alcohol or other drugs.  In compliance with the U.S. Patriot Act, Stritch may be required to provide to selected U.S. government agencies the following information about international students: name, address, visa classification, academic status, and any disciplinary action taken against the students because of their participation in a crime.  Where may one call for more information? The University registrar can be reached at (414) 410-4081.  How does one file a complaint? If students believe that the University is not in compliance with FERPA, they may file a written complaint with the: Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education Washington, D.C. 20202-4605  Record of Requests for Disclosure  Cardinal Stritch University will maintain a record of all requests for disclosure of information from a student’s educational records when the student has not given written permission for disclosure and the disclosure is not to a school official. The record will include the name of the party making the request, any additional party to whom it may be disclosed, and the legitimate interest the party had in requesting or obtaining the information. The record may be reviewed by the student.   CAMPUS SAFETY AND CAMPUS CRIME REPORT Federal law requires each university to collect information concerning campus crime statistics, campus security policies and campus crime prevention programs. The law also requires each institution to make reports to the campus community on crimes that are reported to campus security or local police agencies and are considered to be a threat to students and employees, in a manner that will aid in the prevention of similar occurrences.  The campus safety information and crime report can be accessed online at http://www.stritch.edu/annualsecurityandfiresafetyreport.  COMMITMENT TO NONDISCRIMINATION Cardinal Stritch University, in accordance with applicable provisions of federal law, does not discriminate on grounds of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, age, sexual orientation, creed or handicap in the administration of any of its educational programs or activities, including admission or with respect to employment.   NONDISCRIMINATION/HARASSMENT POLICY  It is the policy of this University to foster a community free of harassment and intimidation. Students and employees are expected to conduct themselves in a respectful manner at all times. Incidents of harassment will not be tolerated and should be promptly reported to a University official.     Page 56    Harassment refers to behavior that is unwelcome and personally offensive to its recipients. There shall be no harassment on the basis of a student’s or employee’s race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, age, gender, marital status, medical condition, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability.   Prohibited harassment includes but is not limited to comments, slurs, jokes, innuendoes, cartoons, pranks, or physical harassment. Harassment also includes negative actions based upon a student’s or employee’s participation in activities identified with any group. In order to promote a non-discriminatory, inclusive environment, our University will support programs to educate its community in regard to respect for all its members.   Discrimination is defined as disparate treatment that unreasonably limits or denies access to, and benefits of, education, educational resources, co-curricular opportunities, housing, or employment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, age, gender, marital status, medical condition, sexual orientation, or physical or mental disability.  There shall be no harassment of a student or employee that is prompted by interpersonal conflict, race, color, national origin, ancestry, religion, age, gender, marital status, medical condition, sexual orientation, physical or mental disability or any other reason.  Incidents of harassment and discrimination should be promptly reported to the following university officials.

DISABILITY POLICY  Policy Statement  Cardinal Stritch University prides itself on creating a learning environment responsive to all students. The University affirms the intent of Federal Law, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, the ADA Amendments of 2008 and the Fair Housing Act (FHAct to the extent applicable to Cardinal Stritch University.  The ADA definition of a disability is: a “person with a disability” is anyone with a physical or mental condition that substantially limits one or more major life activities, such as caring for oneself, performing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working. In addition to those people who have visible disabilities—persons who are blind, deaf, or use a wheelchair--the definition includes a whole range of disabilities that are not visually apparent. These may include mental illness, learning disabilities, or some chronic health conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, cardiac problems, HIV/AIDS condition, and more. In order to offer the appropriate accommodation and assistance whenever possible, documentation of the disability is required by the University.   Policy Implementation  A. Disability Disclosure  A student or an applicant for admission may disclose the presence of a disabling condition and request the accommodations indicated in his/her documentation by contacting the Accessibility Services Coordinator within the Student Support department. In order for the Student Support department to notify a student’s instructors of disability accommodations, that student must sign a release of information form to this effect. Faculty notification does not replace the student’s responsibility to communicate directly with each instructor to discuss accommodation details. Each semester, it is the student’s responsibility to share his/her schedule with the Student Support department so that appropriate instructors may be notified.  For more information, please refer to the Student Accessibility Services webpage: http://www.stritch.edu/Student-Experience/Student-Support/Student-Accessibility-Services.  B. Confirmation of a Disability    Page 57    It is the responsibility of the student to provide medical or other diagnostic documentation of his or her disability as requested. Documentation of disabilities should be directed to the department of Student Support. Students may be required to participate in such additional evaluation of limitations as may be necessary prior to receiving requested accommodations. Each student shall be expected to make timely and appropriate disclosures and requests and to engage in appropriate levels of self-help in obtaining and arranging for accommodations or auxiliary aids, including applying for funding for specialized support services from the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation.   C. Institutional Documentation  All requests for and subsequent University response for accommodations, will be documented by the Accessibility Services Coordinator within the department of Student Support.   D. Statement of Confidentiality  Accommodation plan information will be shared within the University community on a need-to-know basis in accordance with applicable laws. Documentation of disabilities will be kept in the department of Student Support.  E. Appeal of Denied Accommodation Requests  If a student who is denied requested accommodations wishes to appeal the decision, he/she may do so in accordance with the following procedure.   F. Grievance Procedures Relating to Section 504 and The Americans with Disabilities Act  The person who believes he/she has a valid basis for complaint shall address the concern in writing with the Accessibility Services Coordinator who shall, in turn, investigate the complaint in consultation with the Director of Student Support and reply to the complainant in writing within ten days. If the complainant feels that the grievance has not been satisfactorily settled, further appeal may be made to the Special Needs Hearing Committee.   The Special Needs Hearing Committee is convened by the Director of Student Support and is composed of members of the University community who serve on the Student Affairs Committee and who have not participated in the investigation of the complaint. If the Student Affairs Committee representative of the student’s college is unavailable or has been directly involved in the situation, the chair will invite another representative to participate, in order to insure adequate understanding of the program in which the student is enrolled.   If the student needs accommodations in order to fully participate in the committee meeting, he/she should discuss his or her needs with the Accessibility Services Coordinator.   The Special Needs Committee will have access to all documentation of the complaint and will convene to hear any further information from, or on behalf of, the student who is rendering the complaint. The student is able to bring a member of the University community with him or her as a support person. This individual may not speak for, or on behalf of, the student, but may confer quietly with the student, offering support and encouragement. This is not an adversarial process, but rather a chance to gain a deeper understanding into the issues.   The committee will reply immediately to the complaint with a decision that will be documented in writing within 48 hours of the hearing. As a part of the process, the student is informed of the right to appeal and the procedures to be followed. If the student feels that the grievance has not been satisfactorily resolved, an appeal may be made to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. An appeal must be made in writing with specific reasons why the individual believes an appeal is in order. The appeal must be made within 48 hours of the decision of the special needs hearing committee.   All information previously collected on the case is turned over to the Vice President for Academic Affairs in the event that an appeal is requested. The Vice President for Academic Affairs, after reviewing the information, will decide if there is sufficient information to warrant an appeal. If the Vice President for Academic Affairs determined that the appeal is in order, he/she may uphold the original decision, modify the original decision, or make an alternate decision. The decision of the Vice President for Academic Affairs will be final.   Alternative Appeal to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR).   A student has the right to file an appeal with the Office of Civil Rights (OCR).  Information on this process is available from the: Customer Service Team - Office for Civil Rights U.S. Department of Education Washington, "
DC 2020,"2-1100 Phone:  1-800-421-3481 TTY:      1-877-521-2172   Page 58    E-mail:         ocr@ed.gov  Program Accessibility  A. General  Qualified persons will not be denied the benefits of or excluded from participation in a University program or activity because University facilities are inaccessible or unusable by persons with disabilities.   B. Existing Facilities  Each program or activity is operated so that it is readily accessible to qualified persons with disabilities through means such as:   Re-assignment of classes, staff or services to an accessible location, or;   Redesign of equipment or facilities after individual case review.   Concern with classroom accessibility and concerns of accessibility to other areas of the University should be addressed to the Accessibility Services Coordinator and/or the Director of Student Support.   C. New Construction  New facilities or parts of facilities constructed for the use of Cardinal Stritch University will be designed and built so that they and their parts are readily accessible to and usable by persons with disabilities. New construction will be planned in accordance with the “Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accessibilities Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities; Final Guidelines” and federal or state building codes or other methods which provide equivalent access to the facility or part of the facility.   D. Off-Campus Programming  Programs not wholly operated by Cardinal Stritch University that require participation in educational activities or internships (for example, in connection with student teaching assignments) will assure that these activities, as a whole, provide an equal opportunity for the participation of qualified persons with disabilities.   Since Cardinal Stritch University regularly holds classes, programs or activities in facilities other than its own, steps will be taken to use facilities which are accessible. Contractual or lease agreements will reflect efforts to ensure accessibility. It is the responsibility of the prospective enrollee to give sufficient advance notification of the need for any special accommodation or auxiliary aids in order for the accommodations to be made.   Academic Support Services  A. Academic Accommodations Students with disabilities will be supported in their efforts to meet University academic requirements to ensure that the University does not discriminate against them. These supports and accommodations cannot affect the substance of the educational programs or compromise educational standards, nor should they intrude upon legitimate academic freedom. Accommodations may include changes in the length of time permitted for the completion of degrees and adaptation of the manner in which specific course requirements are met.  B. Testing and Assessment Accommodations  Examinations or other procedures for evaluating students’ academic achievement may be adapted for students who have disabilities. It is the individual student’s responsibility to request necessary test accommodations with the Accessibility Services Coordinator and the department of Student Support at the beginning of each semester. Accommodations may include but need not be limited to: enlarged materials, extended time, computer assisted, oral testing, environment free from distractions, alternate formats, preferential seating or test reader. These services are coordinated by the department of Student Support.   C. Provides General Academic Support  The Student Support department provides academic support for individual qualified students as needed to meet course requirements. Support may include, but need not be limited to, tutoring, note taking, enlarging materials and testing accommodations.   The use of tape recorders or brailers in the classrooms or dog guides in campus buildings is not prohibited. Students or participants in University programs or activities may be required to sign an agreement that they will not release tape recordings or transcriptions of lectures.    Page 59     Other  A. Physical Education, Athletics, Similar Activities  Cardinal Stritch University will not discriminate on the basis of disability in physical education, athletics, and similar programs and activities. Qualified disabled students or participants in programs or activities will be provided with an equal opportunity to participate in physical education courses as offered, intercollegiate and intramural athletics, or similar activities as long as the University can reasonably accommodate their disability to allow such participation. All students and participants in Cardinal Stritch University programs or activities must meet the standards and requirements of behavior set by that particular program or activity.   B. Financial Aid  Cardinal Stritch University will not provide less financial assistance to students with disabilities than is provided to nondisabled students, limit their eligibility for assistance, or otherwise discriminate against them. Financial aid awards will recognize the special needs of students with disabilities, including the possible need for reducing credit loads or extending the time allowed to complete graduation requirements.  C. Advising, Counseling, Health and Placement Services  Personal, health, academic, or career counseling, guidance and placement services will be provided in an accessible setting without discrimination on the basis of disability.   D. Housing  Qualified students with disabilities upon application to the residence life program will be provided with comparable, convenient and accessible on-campus housing whenever possible.   E. Co-Curricular Activities  Before providing official recognition or assistance to campus organizations, the Dean of Students should receive assurance that the organization does not permit action prohibited by this policy.   COMPLAINT PROCEDURE Complaint Policy  In a spirit of continual improvement, Cardinal Stritch University recognizes the value of information provided by students, employees, and others in assessing the University’s performance.  Most issues of concern are resolved informally and relationally, consistent with our Franciscan values of caring community, compassion, and peacemaking.   When addressing a problem or issue informally and relationally, individuals are asked to speak to the person most directly responsible for the matter.  If the issue cannot be resolved at that level and an individual wishes to pursue the issue further, he or she may move up the “chain of command,”  one step at a time, from individual faculty or staff member, to department chairperson, and finally to the appropriate Dean or Vice President. Student Affairs is available to advise students and members of the community as to the appropriate people and procedures.  The human resources office is available to advise employees regarding resolution of concerns.     When concerns cannot be resolved informally, or additional review is required or requested, complainants are invited to file the grievance procedure best suited to their particular situation. Links to specific grievance procedures are provided below.     The formal complaint process is reserved for times when the complainant believes that informal processes have not yielded an appropriate resolution and there has been a significant violation, or exists a significant flaw, in the University’s standards, policies, and procedures such that the complainant believes he or she is not being treated fairly and/or the situation creates unnecessary hardship.  Where there are grievance procedures, the complainant is expected to utilize those first, engaging in a formal complaint only when a relevant grievance procedure does not exist, or when the formal complaint process is the final step of the grievance procedure.    The University has established grievance processes for the following issues (all of which can be found at http://www.stritch.edu/Consumer-Information/Complaint-Policy): Academic-Related Grievances, Appeals, and Concerns   Appeal of admissions decision (An Admissions Counselor will guide you through process)   Appeal of dismissal from one’s major (Undergraduate or Graduate Catalog: Academic Policies-Academic Grievances)    Page 60     Grade appeals (Undergraduate or Graduate Catalog: Academic Policies-Academic Grievances)  Appeal of academic dismissal from university (Undergraduate or Graduate Catalog: Academic Policies-Academic Dismissal)  Appeal of Plagiarism findings (Undergraduate or Graduate Catalog: Academic Policies-Academic Integrity)  Academic residency requirement waiver (asking to waive the requirement that the last 30 credit hours must be taken at Stritch) (Form available through Registration Office)  Appeal to take course at another university and transfer it to Stritch, after one is a Stritch student (Form available from Registration’s Office)   Appeal to register with an account balance (Contact University Bursar)  Emergency withdrawal (Contact the Director of Student Support)   Financial Appeals, Grievances, and Concerns  Appeal of charges (College of Business and Management)-Non medical (An Academic Advisor will guide through process)  Appeal of charges (All colleges but College of Business and Management)- Non-medical-(Contact Vice President for Business and Finance)  Appeal of charges (emergency withdrawal)- (Contact the Director of Student Support)    Financial aid appeal for failure to meet satisfactory academic progress (Undergraduate or Graduate Catalog: Financial Aid-Appeals and Reinstatements) (Associate Director of Financial Aid)  Scholarship appeal (Contact Associate Director of Financial Aid)   Appeal to participate in commencement with an account balance (Contact Business Office)   Financial aid concerns not covered above (Contact Director of Financial Aid)   Program Integrity Rule/Consumer Protection  Alleged violations of State consumer protection laws that include but are not limited to fraud and false advertising   Alleged violations of State laws or rules relating to the licensure of postsecondary institutions   Complaints relating to the quality of education other State or accreditation requirements   Ethics/Treatment of Self and Others  Harassment  Disability accommodation or grievance  Sexual abuse/assault/misconduct   Whistleblower’s policy    Veteran’s benefits    Title IX complaint: Accommodation of medically required pregnancy-related needs, gender equity in athletics or other programs (Contact the Vice President for Student Affairs/Title IX Coordinator)   Discrimination (Contact the Vice President for Student Affairs/Title IX Coordinator)    Student Life Appeals, Grievances, and Concerns   Appeal of student conduct sanction (Coordinator of Residence Life for residence hall matter,  Dean of Students within the Office of Student Life for non-residence hall matter)   Residence hall residency requirement waiver (Contact Admissions Counselor)   Medical waiver of meal plan (Contact Dean of Students within the Office of Student Life)  Housing assignment (Contact Coordinator of Residence Life and/or  Dean of Students within the Office of Student Life)   Appeal to participate in co-curricular activities while on academic probation (Contact the Vice President for Student Affairs/Title IX Coordinator)  Complaints Process The online complaint form goes automatically to Student Affairs. Complaints cannot be made anonymously.  The Vice President for Student Affairs determines if a grievance or other resolution process more appropriately applies.  Cases are referred back to appropriate grievance coordinators as appropriate, with clarification and support to the complainant.  If a formal grievance process doesn’t apply, or is exhausted and doesn’t preclude a formal complaint, the issue may be referred to the complaint committee, which is comprised of a broad range of academic and administrative areas of the University.  Filing a Complaint Individuals must follow procedures as outlined in the University’s Student, Faculty, or Employee Handbooks, and University Catalogs. The University regularly reviews its policies and procedures in each of these areas to ensure their clarity and consistent application, compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as well as best practices.  It is the   Page 61    complainant’s responsibility to familiarize him/herself with these policies and seek further clarity and assistance from the appropriate University department, where necessary. Student Affairs is available to assist students and community members in determining the appropriate process; the human resources office serves this function for employees.   Grievances and complaints must be in writing, and must not be anonymous, using the electronic submission form or by printing and mailing a completed copy of the complaint form.  Whether through a grievance or complaint process, an impartial examination of the situation will occur and a response to the complainant will be provided in a timely manner. After the decision is rendered, an analysis will be done by the department(s) involved to clarify or improve processes as appropriate.   An aggregate report, containing data from formal complaints and grievances, will be prepared annually. This report will highlight trends, and potential areas requiring further review.    Individuals filing a complaint will be treated with dignity, and their privacy honored to the extent possible to investigate and resolve a complaint.  Retaliation against an individual filing a complaint in good faith is strictly prohibited, and will result in disciplinary action for any employee or student engaging in such retaliatory behavior.     Page 62    STUDENT SERVICES   ACADEMIC AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT At Cardinal Stritch University we believe in the pursuit of community engaged academic excellence through collaboration and mutually beneficial partnerships that build stronger and more caring individuals, organizations, and communities that together serve the greater good for all.  Through Academic and Community Engagement, the University implements an array of experiential learning and career education initiatives, student internship and employment opportunities, outreach programs and special community based learning projects.   Community Partnerships Stritch is committed to a model of scholarship that puts an emphasis on having our faculty and students engage with the community in mutually beneficial, reciprocal partnerships.   We strive to fulfill our University mission and vision by educating students to be engaged local and global citizens who align their actions with the values of a Franciscan education.  We also place a primacy on identifying the compelling needs of individuals and organizations within our communities, and being responsive to those needs in ways that are both practical and academically rigorous.  Ultimately, we seek partnerships where there is shared planning and decision-making that build authentic relationships and yield measurable results.  Towards these ends, members of the campus community invest their time and resources in collaborating with over 300 community organizations and businesses to create placement, project, enrollment, and signature partnerships.   Experiential Learning and Career Education   The University affirms the importance of experiential learning opportunities embedded in the student experience.  These opportunities help students discern and develop their career readiness, mission in life, and contributions to society.  Staff members serve as a resource for students as they connect with community organizations and prepare for their experiences.  Staff continue to resource students through assisting students in processing their learning in the areas of personal and professional development.  Co-curricular and academic departments are supported as they develop learning opportunities with community partners.

On-campus jobs help students gain meaningful work experience and earn money to offset educational expenses.  Numerous departments around campus have student worker positions and will hire students as those positions become available throughout the year.  Please note there are a limited number of student worker positions available.  Each department hires students directly according to their staffing needs throughout the year, and students need to   Page 63    be proactive in their search.  The Experiential Learning and Career Education office works with the Financial Aid office, Human Resources office, and on-campus employers to manage an employment system that provides students with fair access to jobs and intentional personal and professional development essential to their career readiness.    Beginning in the 2017 – 2018 academic year, all undergraduate students interested in working for one of the on-campus departments are required to register for the Student Employment Program with the Experiential Learning and Career Education office.  Registering provides students with important human resource and financial aid information as well as access to valuable career development resources, workshop information, and on-campus job posting announcements.  Students interested in locating off-campus part- or full-time employment may schedule an appointment with a career professional to develop a job search strategy.

It is a modern science that studies diverse subject matter and has applications to all academic fields of study. Psychology investigates topics such as causes of depression, how the brain responds to drugs, management of daily stressors, how people effectively interact with each other, and ways in which gender, age, and culture influence behavior.   Psychology majors are offered a solid foundation that prepares them for careers in mental health, research, and related fields.  A major emphasis is preparation for graduate programs.  Students take one of several tracks (series of courses) that are specific to their interests.  The curriculum emphasizes comprehensive course content, experiential learning opportunities and the development of skills that promote human and animal welfare.  Students gain direct experience through internship experiences and have the opportunity to present research papers/posters at professional conferences.  Psychology student organizations provide valuable experiences outside the classroom along with the campus chapter of Psi Chi, the international honor society in psychology.  The Psychology Department offers courses that are beneficial for students in majors other than psychology.  Students in nursing, sociology, education, and business often minor in psychology because of the valuable background it provides.  Mission Statement of the Department of Psychology: The Psychology Department believes that students are lifelong learners. Through courses and experiences, Cardinal Stritch University students acquire the attitude and ability to think critically in evaluating information and making informed decisions. Sensitivity to and appreciation for diversity, respect for the dignity and worth of others, and an appreciation and understanding of differences such as those associated with age, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic status, disability, and multicultural experiences are essential.

A communication degree has no boundaries. It translates into multiple work environments with its foundations in interpersonal, small group, persuasive, oral, digital, visual, and written communication. Students develop understanding of and the key skill sets to work in non-profit, corporate, consumer, and mediated communication settings. Throughout the degree program, students build a diversified portfolio demonstrating oral and written strengths, as well as problem-solving, audience analysis, interpersonal dynamics, conflict mediation, and cross-cultural and gender understanding.  Students develop professional experience through experiential and service learning within courses and through self-selected internships. Students are encouraged to complete two internships at different sites and with different job descriptions.  A major in Communication will allow the student to develop the skills necessary to communicate with a variety of audiences in a variety of settings. Career options include entry-level positions in social media, sales, public relations, mass media, business communication, advertising, education, and public service.  Many of our graduates continue their education in graduate or law school, and many receive job offers from their internship sites.  A major or minor in Communication is a strong complement to a major in Sport Management, Psychology, Theater, Art, or Nursing.  MAJOR AND MINOR REQUIREMENTS Communication Major: 42 Credits Required courses for major:  or high school algebra II.   Intermediate Algebra (3 Cr.)

In most of our courses, students are expected to make use of computers, calculators, and other modern technologies to explore and experiment with important ideas and to develop a deep understanding of underlying concepts and problem-solving strategies. Teamwork, particularly in larger problem-solving experiences, is required in most of our courses. Students are encouraged to participate in internship opportunities and pre-professional activities.    The Computer Science major gives students knowledge and skills necessary for the 21st century technology-centered workplace. Hands-on experience with appropriate technologies is integral to the computer science program. In many of the computer science courses, students work in teams to solve larger problems. In this way, they develop skills for working on project teams, providing valuable experience for careers. Computer Science majors are strongly advised to get job-related experience through computer projects and/or internships that take place in the world beyond the classroom.  Because concepts in computer science are deeply rooted in mathematics, Computer Science majors are advised to complete their calculus requirement early in their program. The major provides the flexibility to allow students to pursue one or more concentrations as they explore the various sub-disciplines within computer science.  Teacher certification in computer science is available at the Early Adolescence/Adolescence (grades 6–12) level.    A minor in computer science complements a variety of majors, and prepares students to work in a computer-centered work environment.  Students majoring in mathematics and/or business are particularly encouraged to complete a Computer Science minor.

Each certificate offers a carefully selected mix of courses that is bound together with a common theme and teaches to the learning outcomes of Franciscan heritage and values and local and global community engagement.  Completing an advanced core certificate requires the successful completion of four of the courses offered in the certificate (one from each department). Students who complete all six courses (18 credits) in one of the identified areas will receive a minor.  All traditional undergraduate students may complete an advanced core certificate, but it is required for all students seeking the Bachelor of Arts and Fine Arts degrees.    The six Advanced Core Certificates and associated minors are, by nature and design, quintessentially Stritch.  Each interdisciplinary certificate brings together courses offered by four different programs and is more than the sum of its parts.  Rather than being a set of isolated courses, each Advanced Core Certificate consists of courses that have been carefully designed to be part of an integrated whole.  Each course teaches to the certificate’s theme through the lens of the discipline from which the course is offered and through the lens of the Franciscan value linked to the certificate.  Because the certificates and associated minors have been crafted in this way, there are no substitutions permitted in the advanced core.  This restriction includes alternative courses at Cardinal Stritch University as well as courses at other institutions – however similar they may appear to be to a certificate course.  When scheduling conflicts lead to the inability of a student to complete a certificate, they may have to complete the graduation requirement without completing a certificate (by taking four courses from multiple certificates with certain restrictions).  Students who find themselves in this position should talk with their academic advisor to discuss their options.  DESCRIPTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS Arts and Cultural Studies: 12 credits for certificate/18 credits for minor Engaging in the study of art, dance, language, song, theater, and writing, students will immerse themselves in a landscape of intercultural experiences, leading to an enhanced awareness of cultural diversity.

Concurrently, students will develop the heightened interpersonal skills necessary for impactful local and global community engagement.  Required courses:  or 235  Diversity Studies: 12 credits for certificate/18 credits for minor This certificate in Diversity Studies explores the Franciscan value of reverencing creation by providing opportunities to appreciate and respect diversity in its varied forms.  Students will explore issues of diversity, including those of culture, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality, in the United States and throughout the world, through a study of literature and film, intercultural communication, psychology of gender, and sociology.  This interdisciplinary study will lead to a better understanding of the self in juxtaposition to the other, while also teaching students to understand differences within and among human societies.   Likewise, students will develop cultural awareness that will help guide interactions with communities of diverse peoples.  This certificate will provide experiential learning opportunities for students.  Required courses:  Web Page Creation (3 Cr.)

This program allows undergraduate education students the option to obtain dual licensure in general and special education (ECMC 72-801 or MCEA 73-801 Special Education cross-categorical licensure) with additional course work, Praxis II test and student teaching. The philosophy of the program is that special education teachers need to know everything that general education teachers need to know about curriculum, classroom management, literacy, assessment and planning. In addition, they need specialized knowledge (i.e. issues of IEPs, definition, identification and instructional interventions for students with special needs) as well as supervised field experience. In a performance-based professional education developmental sequence, benchmark key assessment will evaluate undergraduate knowledge, skills and dispositions.    The UGTE program aligns with the Cardinal Stritch University mission and vision, the College of Education and Leadership/School of Education mission, and the College of Education and Leadership/School of Education conceptual framework. The Wisconsin State Standards for Teacher Development and Licensure guide the program and CEC cross categorical/disability specific standards. The specific knowledge, dispositions, and performances are further articulated in the INTASC standards for Teacher Development and Licensure.

It is concerned with the lives of ordinary women and men, as well as heroes and leaders. It challenges students not only to accept change, but to anticipate it and deal with it creatively.  The study of history at Stritch prepares rather than programs students for professional life. Historical study evokes critical thinking and reasoned judgment. It leads students to see the human dimension of issues, to view contemporary events in perspective, to deal critically and positively with conflicting points of view, and to weigh alternatives. Historians bring to the business world the ability to cope effectively with a great deal of material, to distinguish what is important from what is inconsequential, and to synthesize data and represent it in a concise and clear fashion.  The department’s goals are pursued within the philosophical context of Stritch’s mission to enable students to integrate their learning into a purposeful value system that gives moral direction, professional viability and enrichment to their lives and the lives of others.  Students have an opportunity to enhance career skills through experience and training in the use of technology, including the internet, computer databases, presentation software and other appropriate technology, as well as internships and service learning.  Students may obtain a major, minor, teacher certification (elementary, minor, and secondary broad field social studies major), and pre-law preparation.

The Department regularly offers courses in Spanish, French, Italian and German.   The objectives of language studies are to enable students to communicate effectively through the development of skills in understanding, speaking, reading and writing the language and to understand and appreciate the values of cultures and world-views that are different from their own. Modern language study also increases students’ awareness of their own values and beliefs. In addition to helping develop valuable reading and critical thinking skills, classes in literature and civilization acquaint students with the masterpieces in the foreign culture.  When coordinated with studies in other departments, the major will satisfy students with widely differing career goals: working in international business, law, or industry; performing government service; teaching in elementary or secondary schools; continuing language studies in graduate school; working for museums; doing research in original languages; serving in the tourism industry; working in the health care or social service professions.  A Spanish immersion experience is required for all students who have declared a major, minor or a certificate in the Department. Under the guidance of a faculty member and approval of the department, the student will be able to choose from a variety of options to fulfill this requirement. Some of the options include: studying abroad, volunteering or completing an internship in a Spanish-speaking country or at a local community organization. This immersion experience will allow the student to apply learned language skills to real life situations and will be tailored to meet the academic needs and professional interests of each student. In the past, Stritch students have studied abroad or volunteered in Mexico, Spain, Argentina, Guatemala and Costa Rica.  Others have worked for immigration offices, nonprofit organizations, television stations, or teaching Spanish to children and adults in schools and language programs in the Milwaukee area. This requirement is usually satisfied during the junior or senior year in either the fall or spring semester and can be taken as a pass/fail option or for credit (1-4 credits).   The Modern Languages program also offers a Certificate in Spanish Interpretation and a minor in Spanish Translation. The Spanish Interpreting certificate (16 credits) and Spanish Translation minor (21 credits) are designed to enhance students’ language expertise and to prepare them for an interpreting/translating career in the legal, business and health care fields. The course work involves the study of theory and techniques for interpretation and translation as well as terminology and regional language variations. At the same time, students will gain a better understanding of the interpreting and translating field by participating in workshops for students seeking national accreditation, by speaking with professionals in the different areas and by completing an immersion experience.  Retroactive credits for previous language study are available. Students who have studied a foreign language for two or more years are encouraged to seek retroactive credits. Retroactive credits fulfill University credit requirements for graduation.  Students who have taken language classes during high school are required to take the placement exam (WebCape) before they complete their first modern language course at Stritch. Students may only take the exam once; exceptions will be made under certain circumstances and with permission of the chair of the department. The purpose of the WebCape exam is to place the student in the correct course; it is NOT a replacement for a foreign language course. Students may not take the exam after completing a course at Stritch because the results will no longer be valid nor will they be accepted by the department.  For transfer students, the minimum number of credits required in major courses taken at Cardinal Stritch University is 12, including Senior Seminar. The minimum grade for departmental courses in the major is “C.”  For post-baccalaureate students seeking certification in Spanish, a minimum number of three credits must be taken in the department.

Through Religious Studies courses, the student is challenged to examine the religious dimension of human existence, especially with the Franciscan intellectual tradition in mind. The student is asked to explore the manner in which religious traditions and symbols have provided and continue to offer an interpretation of human life. Offerings include courses that explore foundational elements of the broad Christian (Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, etc.) tradition as well as World Religious traditions.  The student will also find courses on Christian Scripture and morality as well as specific courses on Judaism and Islam.  These course offerings allow students the opportunity of exposure to a variety of religious traditions.  The Religious Studies offerings provide a balanced selection of upper division courses that enable students to acquire a more in-depth background as a major or minor in Religious Studies. Students who major in Religious Studies are prepared to pursue various careers ranging from teaching to parish or societal ministries.  MAJOR AND MINOR REQUIREMENTS Requirements for the Religious Studies major are built around four learning outcomes all students should achieve:  Demonstrate familiarity with various religious traditions by articulating a foundational knowledge of the Christian tradition and an introductory knowledge of a tradition other than the student’s own  Begin to apply various critical lenses of awareness (e.g., historical, cultural, contemporary, ethical, spiritual, scientific, secular) in religious/theological thinking and ritualizing  Relate and apply religious understanding and Franciscan values to contemporary issues and problems of human concern  Understand religious diversity as a dimension of a globalized society  Religious Studies Major: 36 credits (12 courses) Each course in the Religious Studies major has been identified with one of the learning outcomes listed above.  The student may choose which courses to take to fulfill the learning outcome requirements.  Note: The required religion course for the Liberal Arts Core will be counted toward the major.  Religious Studies majors are also allowed to take one other 100-level religion course in addition to the required course for the liberal arts core to be counted toward the major.   3 courses from Learning Outcome 1:  Internship (3 Cr.)

Peace requires that society is built upon justice for all members. Most of the world’s religious traditions include teachings on how the truly religious person should care for the poor and the needy in society. A society that strives for just relationships and equality is one in which peace is possible. This course will explore and note convergences in social justice themes between diverse religions such as Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, Native American traditions and Far Eastern traditions.

Students draw upon their professional experience in classroom discussions and in small-group projects in order to integrate theoretical knowledge with the demands of the workplace.  A key objective of each program is to integrate values and ethics into the process of developing competency — an essential ingredient in managing today’s world of rapid global economic and technological change.  ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS General Admission Requirements  All students must have proficiency in the English language as determined by the office of admissions. Proficiency is usually demonstrated by two years of successful academic work in the United States at the high school or college/university level or by passing the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with a score of 550 or better.  All students must meet the work experience requirements specific to their program. The academic assessor has the responsibility for verifying the work experience requirement for students seeking admission to all College of Business and Management degree and certificate programs.  Students who do not meet the specific admission requirements can have their applications reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Good standing (Full Acceptance):  Applicants who meet or exceed the University and College of Business and Management admission requirements are admitted to the University in good standing, without conditions or stipulations.  Provisional: Students who have completed all admission requirements but whose official current transcripts (less than one year old) from all other schools attended have not yet been received may be admitted provisionally.  Students are allowed to remain in a provisional admission status for up to 4 credits.   Provisional students would be responsible for tuition.  During the first course for which the student is registered, the student’s admission file will be checked. If it is complete and all requirements are met, the student will receive notice of acceptance or denial.   Page 113     If the file is not complete after the student has completed four credits, or if the evaluation shows deficiencies, the student will be allowed to complete the current course, and the coursework will be graded, but the student will be withdrawn from the program and the student's provisional admission status would be rescinded.  The student would pay tuition for the course. The student would be eligible to receive an official transcript after all tuition and fees have been paid.  When the file is complete and the deficiencies have been made up, the student is granted admission as a degree seeking student.  Conditional:  Students who have been suspended or dismissed from another college will not be considered for admission until the period of suspension has expired and facts relating to the dismissal or suspension are provided.   Prospective students whose final academic status was probationary at the college last attended are placed on probation for the first four courses in their program (excluding remedial and developmental courses, but including prerequisite courses) and are subject to all policies of probation at the University.    Students not meeting their conditional admission requirement will be dismissed from the University and will be sent a letter of dismissal from the University by the Vice President for Academic Affairs and may not be allowed to continue in the program. Students may submit an appeal to the Vice President for Academic Affairs no later than 30 days after the letter of dismissal has been mailed. For students on conditional admission, completion of the first four courses with a “C” or better in each course (as required in the letter of acceptance) will give the student full acceptance and eligibility for continuation in the program.  Students admitted conditionally who are given a grade of Incomplete in one of their probationary courses may not proceed to subsequent courses until they have removed the Incomplete. If they have already begun their next course before receiving the Incomplete grade, they may complete that course, but may take no other courses until the Incomplete grade is removed.  Evaluating Students Who Delay Starting Their Program Once students have been admitted to the University, permission to enroll in the College of Business and Management will be in effect for one year. During that time, students may enroll in the program to which they have been admitted without submitting new transcripts or admission materials to the University, unless they have attempted additional course work for credit at another institution since they were admitted to the program. However, if the admission takes place prior to the beginning of the academic year on August 1, and enrollment is delayed until after August 1 and there have been changes in the academic requirements for the program, the transcripts will be reevaluated by the University Assessor and a new advising worksheet will be completed. Students are responsible for notifying the University regarding any additional college coursework attempted since the original application. If additional coursework has been attempted, the transcripts will be reevaluated.

We approach teacher education as a reflective, rigorous process through which teacher candidates learn about themselves, their students, and educational practice so our graduates can make the decisions necessary to impact student learning positively across all contexts and with all students.  The education of teachers is a joint venture of the University and the public and private schools.  The UGTE program at Stritch provides early and continuing experiences in public, private and professional development schools. The theme of “bridging knowledge, practice and service” is woven through all elements of the programs. Program outcomes are grounded in the Wisconsin content and teacher standards for licensure.

The checks are done previous to experiences in the field in P-12 schools to ensure protection to our partner schools and pupils.  The criminal background checks need to be completed prior to the start of the candidate’s first field experience course and again before the student teaching semester.  A complete background check as prescribed under Wisconsin’s law includes:  A completed self-disclosure Background Information Disclosure Form;  An electronic criminal history search from the Department of Justice Crime Information Bureau  If the criminal background check should show a criminal background, the candidate is informed that this may prevent him/her from placement in P-12 school environments and affect his/her completing clinical course requirements and eligibility for licensure.  Districts or schools which request information on the results of the background check are provided with a summary of the candidate’s history so that they may decide whether to pursue additional background checks.  Major Dismissal Process and Policy Students who receive more than one grade of a C- in a major course will be dismissed from the major. Students will receive an electronic letter outlining their dismissal and their major will change to Undeclared. Students who wish to be readmitted to the major must write an appeal letter to the Program Chair outlining why they were dismissed, how they will improve, and what their goals are as a teacher candidate.    Page 129    Students who receive one grade of a C- in a major course will receive an electronic letter warning them of the dismissal policy. No dismissal is enacted at that time.   Page 130    EDUCATION STUDIES This course experience provides education professionals with the opportunity to integrate their understanding of educational concepts and processes learned throughout the program of study, specific to the InTASC Core Teaching Standards.

The assigned readings are designed to fully engage the reader towards a critical exploration of the trope of the American Dream. Many of the readings interrogate the idea of the “dream” and expose the racial prejudices inherent in the nationalistic and mythic notions of what constitutes material success and promise in the United States. The literature offers a protest against the political, economic, artistic or social mistreatment of U.S residents of African descent. These texts describe and denounce U.S institutions that uphold racial discrimination. As well,   Page 241    the texts offer a rich example of African American cultural contribution.
