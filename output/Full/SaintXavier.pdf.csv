Founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1846 and charteredin 1847, Saint Xavier's historic roots make it Chicago's oldest college and one of the first institutions of higher learning inIllinois.Founded as Saint Francis Xavier Academy for Females, Saint Xavier inaugurated college classes in 1915, became co-educational in 1969 and gained the status of a university in 1992.Now, the University serves a diverse population of 4,000 students and offers 44 undergraduate degree programs andnearly 26 graduate degree program options.UNIVERSITY HISTORY10WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201911Vision of Our Catholic and Mercy IdentitySaint Xavier University, founded and sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, extends the teaching ministry of Jesus Christ tothose seeking higher education. As an officially recognized ministry of the Catholic Church*, the University grounds itscore activities of teaching, learning, scholarship, and service in Catholic theological principles that affirm the goodnessand value of all creation and posit a view of human persons as created in the image of God and thus free, rational,relational and endowed with inherent dignity.As a Catholic university, Saint Xavier University challenges all the members of its community to search for truth,especially religious truth, and to engage in a dialogue between faith and reason that ultimately leads toward thecontemplation of God's creation and social action for the common good. This search for truth demands carefulobservation, critical analysis, vigorous debate, personal and communal theological reflection, and ethical and engageddecision-making leading toward a life that respects both the inherent dignity of another and the worth of all creation.Setting the context for the search for truth, the University encourages its community, especially its students, to becomefamiliar with the richness of the Catholic intellectual tradition and the imperatives of Catholic social teaching. Respectingacademic freedom, the University strives to be a place where the vigorous discussion of ideas can occur, especially asthey relate to its mission as a Catholic university. In the spirit of respectful and critical discourse, the University welcomesthe breadth of the Catholic tradition as well as the voices of other religious and non-religious communities.As a Mercy university, Saint Xavier University challenges its community members to teach, learn, research, and act notonly for themselves but also for others. Thus, a seminal characteristic of the University is its commitment to service.Ideally, such service, whether direct or through the University's efforts to understand and remediate unjust systems,reflects the spirituality of Catherine McAuley, the founder of the Sisters of Mercy. This spirituality is grounded in thetheology of the Incarnation, animated by the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, and expressed through acts ofcompassion that embody the spiritual and corporal works of mercy**. In particular, the University community expressesspecial concern for those who are economically poor, especially women and children. In so doing, the University goesbeyond simply passive expressions of heartfelt concern, and even willingness to stand with those who suffer. It seeks toright what is wrong and restore what is broken, thereby promoting human dignity, justice and the common good.Saint Xavier University signifies and celebrates its Catholic and Mercy heritage in its symbolic, sacramental and liturgicalexpressions, and in its communal and collegial ethos. The University offers many opportunities to reflect, pray, worshipand access the sacraments. It symbolizes its rich faith tradition through the appropriate placement of religious symbolsand artwork. Further, it observes liturgical seasons and feasts central to its Catholic and Mercy heritage, and providesorientation and mentoring programs that educate the community about this identity.Recognizing that the search for God and the celebration of God's presence is ubiquitous, the University providesopportunities for those of other faith traditions and those on a personal journey of faith to study, to express, to worship, tocelebrate and to discuss their religious beliefs in a climate that is respectful, hospitable and open to all.To summarize, offering the opportunity for higher education within a Catholic and Mercy context, Saint Xavier Universityhonors Jesus Christ whom it recognizes as "the Way, the Truth and the Life," the motto of the University inscribed on itscoat of arms.Approved by the Board of Trustees - March 30, 2008. Reaffirmed by the Board of Trustees - September 11, 2017.*In its governance, Saint Xavier University is a Catholic and Mercy institution because its sponsors, the Sisters of Mercy,hold certain "reserved powers" consonant with their canonical (Church) and civil responsibilities for the University. These"reserved powers" are outlined in the University's articles and bylaws, and with limited exceptions, are exercised on behalfof the Sisters of Mercy by the Conference for Mercy Higher Education. It is through this governance relationship with theSisters of Mercy that Saint Xavier University is recognized by the Roman Catholic Church as a Catholic institution andministry.**Based largely on the gospel of Matthew, chapter 25, the works of mercy are as follows: Spiritual Works of Mercy:Instruct the ignorant. Counsel the doubtful. Comfort the sorrowful. Admonish the sinner. Bear wrongs patiently. Forgive allinjuries. Pray for the living and the dead. Corporal Works of Mercy: Feed the hungry. Give drink to the thirsty. Clothe thenaked. Shelter the homeless. Visit the sick. Visit the imprisoned. Bury the dead.The Sisters of MercyFounder and sponsor of Saint Xavier University, the religious congregation of the Sisters of Mercy originated in Dublin,Ireland. Today, nearly 10,000 Sisters of Mercy, along with Mercy Associates and Companions, serve in more than 40countries around the world on every continent except Antarctica.Within that global Mercy community, the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas accounts for 4,000 Sisters andsome 3,000 Mercy Associates and Companions working in almost a dozen Central and South American nations, theCaribbean, Guam, the Philippines, and the United States. Through its Conference for Mercy Higher Education, the Sistersof Mercy of the Americas sponsor or co-sponsor 16 colleges and universities in the United States, including Saint XavierUniversity. These Mercy institutions of higher education serve over 34,000 undergraduate and graduate students.A Brief HistoryFounded in 1831 by Mother Mary Catherine McAuley, and quickly dubbed "the walking Sisters," the congregation ofRoman Catholic women now known as the Sisters of Mercy moved beyond convent walls to walk amid and serve thepoor, the sick and the uneducated of their day. Such "secular" work outside the convent was unusual at the time becausemost communities of women religious were cloistered, working only within convent walls. The availability of these newSisters of Mercy, to carry the works of mercy to those in need, caused the congregation to spread with unusual rapidity.These were women "capable of combining personal spirituality with a pioneering spirit of initiative and independence," asthe American founder Mother Frances Xavier Warde once put it.In 1843, seven Sisters of Mercy left Ireland for Pittsburgh, the first Mercy Foundation in the United States. In 1846, theeducational needs of Irish immigrants and others drew the Sisters of Mercy from Pittsburgh to a pioneer town calledChicago.Under the guidance of Mother Frances Xavier Warde, for whom the Warde Academic Center at Saint Xavier Universityis named, five Sisters of Mercy, all under the age of 25, arrived in a diocese that was barely three years old. The first andonly group of women religious in Chicago for the next 10 years, the Sisters quickly established St. Francis Xavier FemaleAcademy, the forerunner of Saint Xavier University and Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School.Within eight years of their arrival, all but one of the original group of SXU founders had died, most as a result of thenursing care they gave to victims of the epidemic diseases that periodically swept through the city. But other women hadjoined the Sisters of Mercy, devoting themselves to spreading the Good News of the Gospel by their good example, theirprayer, their tireless acts of compassion and hospitality, and their institutional ministries.Since 1846, Saint Xavier University has benefited from the continuous support of the Sisters of Mercy. The names of theChicago Mercy pioneers, of Saint Xavier's Sister of Mercy Presidents, and of all the Sisters of Mercy, living and dead, whohave served at SXU since its 1956 move to the current Chicago campus are inscribed in the Mercy Heritage Walk leadinginto McDonough Chapel. These names recall the respect, compassion, hospitality, service and excellence with which theSisters of Mercy have endowed SXU. Today, together with their lay faculty and staff colleagues, who increasingly andmost ably share the responsibility for grounding the teaching and learning mission at Saint Xavier University in its Catholicand Mercy heritage, the Sisters of Mercy continue their mission of serving "the poor, the sick and the uneducated" in thename of Jesus Christ.University Celebrations of MercySaint Xavier University celebrates its Mercy heritage throughout the year, but especially through its annual SeptemberSpirit of Mercy Day program, First Friday occasions of charism education, formation and social action and on MissionHeritage Day in March.Spirit of Mercy Day: SeptemberCatherine McAuley opened the original House of Mercy in Dublin, Ireland on the September 24 Feast of Our Lady ofMercy. Mercy institutions and ministries throughout the world recognize this day when Catherine McAuley realized herdream of creating a place where the poor, especially women and young girls, would find safe lodging and instructionin their faith and in skills that would lead to honorable employment. This work at the House of Mercy eventually ledCatherine to establish the Sisters of Mercy in 1831.THE SISTERS OF MERCY12WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201913Each year Saint Xavier University brings together the traditional opening of a new academic year Liturgy of the Holy Spiritwith this foundational feast of the Sisters of Mercy and creates a Spirit of Mercy Day. Liturgy and programs scheduledfor the day highlight the values central to Mercy heritage. Hospitality extended to and by Sisters associated with theUniversity is a part of each Spirit of Mercy Day at SXU. Service, especially the service of leadership, is honored andencouraged with the formal commissioning of representative leaders from all segments of the University community-sponsors, trustees, administrators, faculty, staff, students and alumni. The Spirit of Mercy Day leadership commissioningtakes place alongside the Academy Bell, a campus site richly symbolic of the Mercy spirit. Pre-dating the Chicago fire in1871, the Academy bell regularly called the Sisters of Mercy to prayer and to teaching during Saint Xavier's early years asan Academy. Left behind but secretly salvaged by a savvy Sister of Mercy when Saint Xavier moved to 103rd Street, theAcademy bell was returned to Saint Xavier University and installed near the main entrance of the Warde Academic Centerin 2004.First Fridays: October-AprilSelect First Fridays during each academic year provide opportunities for the University community to imbibe, embraceand embody the practical spirituality of Catherine McAuley, Frances Xavier Warde and early Sister of Mercy pioneers inliving the corporal and spiritual works of mercy. Some First Fridays focus on why we tell the story of Mercy through timeso that members of the University community become increasingly familiar with the history and heritage of the Sisters ofMercy. Other First Fridays are opportunities to engage is some form of social action that speaks to one of the Sisters ofMercy Critical Concerns. Every First Friday includes a time for shared hospitality and the legendary sharing of a cup of teain comfort.Mission Heritage Day: MarchThe University annually honors Sister of Mercy Mother Frances Xavier Warde, the founder of the Sisters of Mercyin America in 1843 and the woman who brought the Sisters of Mercy to Chicago in 1846. Each year's ceremoniesinclude a Eucharistic liturgy in which "The Heritage Litany" has a prominent place. Guest speakers often enhance theday's festivities, which lead, finally, to the annual Mission Awards ceremony. This is a day whereby all members of theUniversity community reflect on and renew their commitment to an educational mission that has persisted through morethan 170 years of changing curricula and diversifying student populations. Mission Heritage Day weaves the strandsof history into the current moment challenging the University community to celebrate its lush past and honor its legacyinto the future.

In all programsof study, the University encourages the examination of fundamental questions of human concern, respectful dialogue inthe context of diverse points of view and experience, as well as the search for truth and justice.In an atmosphere of intellectual rigor made possible by academic freedom, University faculty develop and teach coursesin their areas of advanced study, extend research in their disciplines, produce scholarly and creative work and serve theUniversity and community. Faculty are also responsible for academic policies and the design and content of the Universitycurriculum. In teaching, scholarship and service, faculty represent one of the most visible examples of the intellectual lifeof the University.Students at Saint Xavier encounter a wide range of coursework, co-curricular activities, community experiences andsupport services designed to enhance their learning at all levels, and to help them develop more fully as confident,contributing citizen leaders of an ever-increasingly complex and global community. The University seeks studentsof diverse talents, experiences, knowledge, interests and cultures who are willing and prepared to learn and to seekexcellence in themselves and others.Vital to the success of teaching and learning are the dedicated members of variously skilled academic support servicesand the administrative leadership charged with fostering strategic planning, institutional assessment and effectivestewardship and deployment of University resources.The enduring fellowship of alumni, emeriti faculty, Sisters of Mercy sponsors, trustees and other friends and contributorsin the community at large demonstrates their continuing faith in the central mission of Saint Xavier through various acts ofgiving, prayer and support.Infusing this community of shared concern are the distinctive qualities and values of Saint Xavier University, including thebelief that faith and reason can interact in mutually fruitful ways. Therefore, the University membership encourages a fullsearch for truth, including religious truth, while respecting freedom of personal expression. It also promotes a vigorousand compassionate dialogue among the various faith traditions, and between them and the academic disciplines. At itsfoundation, teaching and learning at Saint Xavier are premised upon and committed to the fundamental dignity and uniqueworth of each human person.Accepted by Faculty Senate, March 28, 2006Approved by the Board of Trustees, May 10, 2006Approved by the Corporate Member, May 25, 2006Reaffirmed by The Board of Trustees, September 11, 2017.Degrees AwardedThe University by its charter of 1847 is authorized "to confer on such persons as may be considered worthy, suchacademic or honorary degrees as are usually conferred by similar institutions."Saint Xavier University awards undergraduate students Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Business Administration(BBA), Bachelor of Music (B.M.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.) or Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degrees.Graduate students are awarded Master of Applied Computer Science (MACS), Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Arts inTeaching (MAT), Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Science (M.S.), or Master of Science in Nursing(MSN) degrees.DEGREES AWARDED16WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201917Accreditation and MembershipsAccreditationThe University is accredited at the institutional level by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Associationof Colleges and Schools (230 South LaSalle Street, Suite 7-500, Chicago, Illinois 60604-1411; 1-800-621-7440 or1-312-263-0456).Both the baccalaureate and graduate programs in the School of Nursing and Health Sciences are accredited by theCommission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).Both the baccalaureate and graduate programs in the Graham School of Management are accredited by the Associationto Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB).The Education Department is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE).

All other students are assigned faculty advisors within the department of their major.Changes of major or staff advisor are arranged through the Office of Records and Advising. In order to request a changeof an advisor who is a faculty member, the student must make the request of the department chair of their current major.All undergraduate students must have their advisor's approval to register for fall and spring classes. All students in theEducation Department, both graduate and undergraduate, must have their advisor's approval to register for all terms andsemesters. Advisors provide information about core and departmental requirements, transfer credit, academic status,academic policies, articulation agreements, procedures and University services. Students are encouraged to make regularcontact with their advisors on matters of academic planning and progress. Students should regularly check their programevaluation in Self-Service for accuracy and progress towards graduation. The ultimate responsibility for making decisionsabout educational plans consistent with policies of the University rests with the student.Academic Catalog PolicyPart-time and full-time students enrolled in a continuous program must adhere to the program requirements stated in thecatalog at the time of their matriculation into the University. The only exception to this practice occurs when state-certifiedprograms, such as education, change requirements and require a definite time for implementation.Student's who leave the University for more than two consecutive semesters must adhere to the program requirements ineffect at the time they are readmitted to the University.ACADEMIC CATALOG POLICY72WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201973Academic DismissalThe academic records of students who have earned a grade point average below 2.0 are reviewed at the end of the fall,spring and summer terms. A determination is made if the student is dismissed or allowed to continue for another semesteron strict academic probation. Each dismissed student will receive official notification via U.S. mail and through his/herSXU email account. All future registrations will be removed and/or blocked. Academic dismissal will be noted on thestudent's official transcript and will be part of the student's record.A dismissed student may appeal the dismissal to the associate provost during the period of time specified in the dismissalletter. The appeal, stating the reasons for which the student considers the review justified, must be submitted via SXUemail to the associate provost. The development of an academic plan in consultation with an academic advisor is requiredas part of the dismissal appeal process. The appeal will be reviewed by the associate provost in consultation with thedean, associate dean and program director. If the appeal is granted, notice will include the terms and conditions ofcontinued study, and the student's status will be changed to strict academic probation. If the appeal is not granted, noticewill include recommendations if the student plans to apply for readmission at a later date.Academic IntegrityA commitment to academic integrity is at the heart of Saint Xavier's mission as an intellectual community, dedicated,in the words of the University Philosophy Statement, to the examination of fundamental questions of human concern,respectful dialogue in the context of diverse points of view and experience, as well as the search for truth and justice. Forfaculty and students alike, the scholarly enterprise requires clear and rigorous argument, acknowledging the sources ofour ideas, the quality of the evidence that supports them and taking responsibility for the errors we have made.The efforts of students to cultivate these academic skills and intellectual virtues in turn requires formative evaluation,accurately and justly assessing student progress. In order to achieve this, instructors must be certain that students' workis their own and that all records of accomplishment are authentic and reliable. In this context, when students misrepresenttheir knowledge or abilities, they are more than simply breaking the rules of academic conduct. Such behavior underminesnot only the student's own academic progress, but the integrity of academic evaluation itself. For that reason, it mayresult in failure for the assignment, failure for the course, suspension from the University or permanent dismissal from theUniversity.The principles of academic integrity should govern all forms of academic work, from the content of papers, projects andpresentations to one's conduct before and during examinations. These principles -- and thus the very possibility of honestevaluation -- can be jeopardized by a number of actions, including but not limited to:•Cheating on an examination, including but not limited to, using cheat sheets or unauthorized materials,copying from peers or obtaining copies of tests through unauthorized means;•Unauthorized collaboration with one's peers on assignments, exams, projects or presentations;•Plagiarizing, which may include:•copying phrases or sentences word for word from a source without enclosing thecopied words in quotation marks and indicating the actual source;•changing the wording of a source slightly, but still incorporating all the ideas of thesource without indicating the source;•altering the wording significantly but still incorporating the main ideas from othersources without indicating, through standard forms of documentation, whichsources have been used, thereby implying that the ideas are one's own;•Unacknowledged and unauthorized resubmission of work completed in other courses;•Using unauthorized or falsified instruments of identification with the intent of academic fraud;supplying false academic records (transcripts, grade reports, etc.) to any official of the University;forging, altering or making unauthorized use of University records or documents;•Hindering one's peers by removing, misplacing or defacing library or other instructional materials.Faculty and administrators who discover such violations should compile evidence sufficient to document the incident andmay impose penalties appropriate to their purview. When the offense and proposed penalty entail suspension or dismissalfrom the University, the violation must be addressed in consultation with the appropriate dean and the provost.Students who believe they have been wrongly accused and penalized may initiate a Course Grade Grievance, asdescribed in the Course Grade Grievance Procedure.ACADEMIC INTEGRITY74WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201975Academic LoadUndergraduate students carrying 12 credit hours or more per semester are classified as full-time students. Full-timeclassification for summer is 12 credit hours.100 and 200-Level CoursesConsidered lower-level undergraduate courses300-Level CoursesConsidered upper-level undergraduate coursesGraduate students may not apply 300 level courses toward graduate degree requirements.400 to 999-Level CoursesConsidered graduate-level coursesUndergraduate students may enroll in graduate courses only with the written permission of the dean/director of theprogram in which the course is being offered.Academic Minor Requirements1.Satisfactory completion of the requirements for the minor, as designated by the academic program.2.Student's transferring from other institutions and working toward a minor must:a.Satisfy all the standards and requirements of the corresponding minor at SaintXavier in order to be awarded a minor at Saint Xavier University.b.Complete a minimum of 9 credit hours of minor requirements at Saint XavierUniversity.Requirements for minors at Saint Xavier University may not exceed 24 credit hours, unless necessitated by professionalcertification requirements.ACADEMIC MINOR REQUIREMENTS76WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201977Academic MisconductStudents are expected to conduct themselves in compliance with the Code of Student Conduct. Because "determinationof whether a student is being disruptive in class is left to the sole discretion of the faculty member leading theclass" (Student Handbook), faculty have the right to dismiss a disruptive student from a particular class meeting withoutprior notification. In cases of repeated disruptive behavior on the part of the same student, a faculty member mayrecommend to the program director, chair or school dean, in writing, that the student be removed from the course forthe remainder of the current semester. The chair, program director or school dean will attempt to mediate the situationbetween the student and faculty member.In the College of Arts and Sciences, if the program director or chair agrees with the faculty member's recommendationthat the student be removed from the course, he or she will notify the dean of the school. The dean will attempt to mediatethe situation between the student and faculty member within a reasonable period. In all schools, if the dean affirms therecommendation to remove the student from the course, the dean should forward the recommendation and a summaryof the reasons to the provost. The provost should attempt to resolve the matter through discussion with the concernedpersons. The provost will notify the student by traceable mail either of his/her removal from the class, and the reasons, orthe conditions under which he/she may remain in class. Should the determination be removal from class, the provost willnotify the director of records and advising, director of financial aid, dean of students and the student's academic advisor.The student may appeal this decision in the following manner:1.The student may submit a written grievance to the provost within five days.2.The provost then constitutes a Student Academic Grievance Committee (SAGC). The SAGC iscomposed of three members: two faculty members and a student. One faculty member will be servingon and selected by the academic policies committee, another will be appointed by the provost and thestudent will be selected by the dean of students, from among the members of the Saint Xavier Council(formerly Student Government). The academic policies committee representative will serve as chair ofthis committee.3.The provost then forwards the grievance, and the SAGC must notify the faculty member and thestudent and hold a hearing. The SAGC must submit its written recommendations to the provost within15 working days after its formation.4.Within five days after the provost has received the decision of the committee, the provost mustannounce the decision to the student and faculty member.Academic ProbationThe academic records of all enrolled undergraduate students are reviewed at the end of each semester and summerterm. The University reserves the right to dismiss any student whose cumulative grade point average (GPA) falls below2.0. Any continued student whose cumulative GPA is less than 2.0 will be placed on academic probation. Second-semester freshmen who have a GPA below 2.0 and who have been allowed to continue for the spring semester mustattend the rebound workshop that focuses on academic recovery, during the spring.A student on probation must achieve a cumulative GPA of 2.0 within the next term of enrollment at the University. If,during the probationary period, the 2.0 cumulative GPA is approached but not reached, a student may be placed onstrict academic probation for one semester. A student who has not reached the 2.0 GPA standard at the end of the strictprobation period is subject to the dismissal policies of the University. (See section on academic dismissals.) Any studenton probation may be required to carry a reduced course load. Probationary status is removed at the end of any gradingperiod, provided the student has achieved a 2.0 cumulative GPA.Completion of coursework for which a grade of Incomplete has been given will not result in recalculation of cumulativeGPA during that term. Any change of academic status will not take place until the end of the semester or summer duringwhich the work has been completed, unless the potential GPA is less than 2.0.ACADEMIC PROBATION78WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-201979Academic Status Grievance ProcedureA student notified of being suspended or dismissed for academic reasons may request a review by the provost. Thewritten request must clearly indicate a substantive reason for the review. The provost, after consulting with the associateprovost, and others as necessary, will notify the student in writing of the outcome of the review. The decision is final.Academic YearThe academic school year is comprised of two 16-week semesters, the first ending mid-December, the second endingearly May. Some classes are offered in shorter time frames within the semester. Classes are also offered in the summerduring a variety of time frames.

It is anticipated that, in most cases,this discussion will suffice and the matter will not need to be carried further. Schools and colleges that have departmentalchairs (e.g., Arts and Sciences) will require students to meet with the chair of the department prior to Step 2.Step 2: MediationIf the student grievance is not resolved through discussion with the instructor, the student may submit a Course GradeGrievance Form (hereinafter referred to as the "grievance form"), along with any documents that the student believessupport the grievance. The grievance form and supporting documents must be submitted to the dean's office. Thegrievance should be filed in the school, in the office of the dean in which the course is being offered within the first 20business days after the completion of Step 1.Note: The grievance forms will be housed in the dean's office of the School of Nursing and Health Sciences, College ofArts and Sciences and the Graham School of Management.Once the grievance form is received by the dean, the formal course grade grievance process begins and the dean sendsthe paperwork to a mediator, selected by the dean for the case (a mediator may serve more than once). The mediator has15 business days from receipt of the grievance form in which to complete Step 2.If the mediator determines that a student grievance is not eligible to be resolved under this course grade grievance policy,the mediator indicates "Ineligible" on the grievance form, completes the rationale section and distributes copies of theform to the student, the faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the dean.The student can provide a written appeal of the mediator's decision to the dean if applicable. The dean will either upholdthe mediator's decision or grant the appeal and begin Step 3. The dean will send official notification of the decision to thestudent, the faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the mediator.Eligible Course Grade GrievanceIf the student submits a grievance that is eligible to be resolved under this course grade grievance policy, the mediatorshould inform the student of the course grade grievance process.The mediator sends a copy of the student's grievance form and the supporting documents to the faculty member, so thatthe faculty member can respond to the grievance. The mediator is expected and encouraged to converse with the student,the faculty member and any other individual that might need to be included to help resolve the grievance. The mediatoris encouraged to bring those specifically involved in the grievance together when the mediator believes such a meetingwill help resolve the issue. The mediator has the latitude to request documentation and set deadlines for receipt of suchdocumentation, as deemed necessary.If the grievance is resolved, the mediator describes the resolution on the grievance form and distributes copies of thecompleted form to the student, faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and the dean.If the grievance is not resolved, the mediator indicates "not resolved: requires an Ad Hoc Committee review" on thegrievance form and copies the student, faculty member, the faculty member's immediate administrative superior and thedean. At that point, the mediator is no longer involved. As a courtesy, the mediator would be notified of the outcome at theconclusion of the process.Step 3: Ad Hoc Course Grade Grievance CommitteeThe role of the Ad Hoc Course Grade Grievance Committee is to make a final decision on all course grade grievancesthat are not successfully resolved at the mediation level. The Ad Hoc Course Grade Grievance Committee will hereinafterbe referred to as the Ad Hoc Committee.Structure of the Ad Hoc CommitteeFormation of the Ad Hoc CommitteeThe dean will form an Ad Hoc Committee (only after step 2 has been completed) within 10 business days of receiving thegrievance form. Within these 10 business days, the dean will send the provost a notice of the committee formation and willsend each committee member the following:•written notice of the committee formation, date of the formal charge, date by which the committeeshould have its recommendation formulated, names and contact information of committee members;•a copy of the grievance file that was established at the mediation level;•written description of the Ad Hoc Committee function, timeline and process, as excerpted from thefaculty and student handbooks.Upon confirmation of willingness to serve by the three ad hoc committee members, the dean will formally charge thecommittee with the task of reviewing the case and coming to a conclusion. The conclusion must be decided within 25business days of the formal charge of the committee. The dean will inform the student, faculty member and facultymember's immediate administrative superior in writing about the committee formation and timeline.The Ad Hoc Committee will consist of three tenured or tenure-track full-time faculty members whose primary responsibilityis teaching and who have no conflicts of interest with the case at hand (at least one member of the committee must bea tenured faculty member). These full-time faculty members need to be within the discipline of the course grade beinggrieved, or in programs where there are few or no full-time, tenure-track or tenured faculty, the dean will select facultyfrom within a closely allied field or within the school in which the grade is being grieved. One of the three members mustbe within the discipline or a closely allied field. The chair of the Ad Hoc Committee must be a tenured faculty member andwill be designated as chair by the dean.Guidelines for the Ad Hoc CommitteeOperation of the Ad Hoc CommitteeThe Ad Hoc Committee chair will convene the committee as soon as possible after each member receives the chargeand grievance file. Committee members will review the file and meet to discuss the merits of the matter. The chair ofthe committee will appoint someone with the sole responsibility of keeping minutes of meetings, and such minuteswill become part of the grievance file. The committee will deliberate and achieve a simple majority decision as to itsrecommendation regarding the course grade in question.The Ad Hoc Committee may or may not permit new information from those specifically involved in the grievance. Thosespecifically involved in the case may also request permission to submit new information pertinent to the case.

In general, one credit hour representsone hour of class or two to four hours of laboratory work a week for a semester. Variations from this general plan ofequivalence are typical in such instructional modes as seminars, independent study and credit-by-examination. Thequality of work is indicated by grade points:GradeDescriptionGrade PointsAExcellent4BGood3CAcceptable2DPoor1FFailure ***Requires last date ofattendance0IIncomplete0PPass (D or better)0RRepeat0WWithdrawal0XStudent did not attend0CICourse In Progress0Pass/Fail GradingStudents who have established and maintained a 2.0 grade-point average after completion of 15 hours at Saint XavierUniversity may take their elective credit hours on pass/fail grading. It is understood that instructors will allow a student totake any course that is an elective in the student's individual program on a pass/fail basis.Pass/fail grading may not be taken in:•any course fulfilling General Education requirements•any course in the major field•any course specified as required in a major program, even if that course is in a department other thanthe majorThe P grade does not carry any grade points; therefore it does not affect the cumulative grade-point average.The F grade does affect the cumulative grade-point average.The responsibility for finding out whether a course is required in an individual student's program rests with thestudent, not with the instructor of the course. Students should review their program evaluation on Self-Service toensure that courses apply to their program.A student wishing to elect courses on a pass/fail basis should acquire a form from the Office of Records and Advising(A-203), secure the signature of the instructor and submit it to the Office of Records and Advising no later than Monday ofmid-term week of the section.A student who chooses pass/fail grading may not revert to regular grading after pass/fail has been elected.

The student and instructor agree on requirements and timelimit for completion of the course. The agreed upon date is then entered by the instructor during the grading process.Requirements must be completed no later than the 10th week of the following semester (fall or spring). Failure to meetthe stated requirements will result in an automatic grade of F. If a student carries more than one incomplete grade intothe following semester, his/her course load should be reduced.

The disposition grievance forms are housed in the officeof the Department Chair of the Education Department.Once the dean receives the grievance form, the formal disposition grievance process begins, and the dean sends thepaperwork to a mediator, selected by the dean for the case (a mediator may serve on more than one case).Step 2: MediationThe mediator has 10 business days from receipt of the disposition grievance form to initiate mediation. The role of themediator is to be informed of the needs of both parties and to work with both parties to identify potential solutions. Themediator will submit a report to the department chair that includes an overview of the process and a recommendation.If the mediation is not successful, the mediator will provide a written report to the department chair. The candidate canprovide a written appeal to the mediator's recommendation to the dean. The department chair will either uphold themediator's recommendation or uphold the appeal.

Therefore, these experiences:1.Connect candidates with the community and provide them with learning experiences in a variety ofeducational environments with exposure to diverse cultures and encouraging candidates to celebratethe diversity of students in American schools2.Connect with professional courses and are designed to sequentially complement and expand uponUniversity course content3.Are assigned by the Director for School Partnerships and take place in selected educational settingsthat have written contracts with the University, which serve to establish a professional developmentrelationship4.Typically take place during daytime school hours5.Recognize NCATE, ISBE and institutional standards and follow the state of Illinois and Saint XavierUniversity Education Department policiesThe field experiences associated with each program are noted as part of the course descriptions. Candidates are requiredto complete all field experience requirements associated with Education Department coursework prior to clinical practice.Candidates who intend to complete their clinical practice in private schools must complete a minimum of 60 hours of fieldexperience in public school settings.Criminal Background InvestigationsState law (Illinois School Code 5/10-21.9) prohibits a school board from employing a person convicted of certain felony,sex, narcotics and drug convictions, and the Education Department has made a commitment to local area schools torequire criminal background checks for all candidates in programs with field experiences.Movement through the program may be suspended for failure to comply with the background check requirements. It is theresponsibility of the candidate to refer to the Illinois School Code and/or seek legal counsel if it is suspected that his/hercriminal history may bar licensure or employment in a school district or agency.Education Department Fingerprinting PolicyField ExperienceIt is the responsibility of the SXU Education Department to verify to our school partners that teacher candidates assignedto school sites for field experiences and/or clinical practice have not been convicted of any illegal activity. To ensure theaccuracy and current nature of this information, all Education Department candidates must complete the Chicago PublicSchools fingerprinting/background investigation process through Accurate Biometrics prior to any course related fieldexperiences.Accurate Biometrics is the fingerprinting vendor for the Chicago Public School (CPS) system. If the CPS fingerprintingprocess is followed and the appropriate CPS fingerprinting form is used at an Accurate Biometrics location, thefingerprinting process produces both an FBI and an Illinois State Policebackground check report. The fingerprintsare checked against the databases of both agencies (FBI and Illinois state police). Once processed by both agencies,the background check results are generated directly to CPS. If any subsequentconvictions occur (HIT) after the initialfingerprinting, CPS would receive thereport and notify the SXU Education Department accordingly, if any actionisnecessary.Other fingerprinting agencies do not share updated reports with the SXU Education Department. SXU EducationDepartment candidates pursuing licensure in Illinois must complete the Accurate Biometrics CPS fingerprinting process toensure that all of our candidates are currently free of any convictions each time they enter our partner schools.Exceptions:•Education Department candidates currently employed as certified teachers, substitutes orparaprofessionals in the Chicago Public School (CPS) system. If CPS currently employs a candidate,the candidate needs to notify the Education Department; we then verify their employment with our CPSliaison.•Students-at-large (e.g., certified student teaching mentor teachers taking a free course) if they areenrolled in a course requiring field experiences and those field experiences will be completed in theschool/school district in which they are currently employed. However, if field experiences are to becompleted in a setting other than the current school/district of employment of the student-at-large, theAccurate Biometrics CPS fingerprinting process must be completed.Student TeachingA second fingerprinting/background check is required prior to student teaching as per an Illinois law that went into effectJanuary 1, 2016:PA 99-021 became effective on January 1, 2016. Pursuant to this Public Act, each student teacher (defined to includethose completing required internships) is required, prior to starting a student teaching or required internship experience, toauthorize and pay for the school or school district where the student teaching is to be completed to conduct a fingerprint-based criminal history records check of that individual. Institutions should verify all student teaching candidates are awareof the background check (and its cost) prior to student teaching, and practice open communication with the school ordistrict regarding the completion of the background check prior to the candidate beginning student teaching.Reference: Student Teacher Background Checks Go Into Effect January 1CRIMINAL BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS158WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019159Early Childhood Education ProgramThe undergraduate Early Childhood Education Program prepares candidates to work with children from Birth throughGrade 2.

Most department courses satisfy University generaleducation requirements in history and/or social sciences. Some courses fulfill general education requirements in foreigncultures, diversity or global studies. The department offers majors in history, political science, political communication andadvocacy, leadership and public administration, social sciences education and international studies. It offers minors inhistory, political science, international studies, digital humanities and public administration.Secondary Education StudentsThe History and Political Sciences Department has designed its programs to align with the Illinois Content Area Standardsfor Educators established by the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), and the Standards of the National Council forSocial Sciences (NCSS). Students who wish to become high school history teachers must seek licensure in the area ofsocial sciences with a disciplinary specialization in history. They must pass the content examination which covers a widerange of concepts from history and the social sciences. The department offers a Social Sciences Education (SOCSC)major intended to prepare students for licensure under these policies. This program satisfies the Illinois Content AreaStandards and leads to licensure in social sciences with a history specialization. The Social Sciences Education majorprovides a strong grounding in history but also allows students to develop a breadth across the social sciences. Interestedstudents should discuss the program with advisors in the department. Students seeking secondary licensure must also beadmitted to the Education Department, which requires maintaining an SXU grade-point average of 3.0 and meeting thebasic skills requirement. Students in the SOCSC Education major must achieve an overall SXU grade-point average of3.0 and complete all major courses, all general education courses, and all professional education courses with a minimumgrade of C to be admitted to student teaching. Students considering this major should be aware that they might face acompetitive job market as prospective secondary social science teachers. Success depends upon strong mastery of thecontent area as demonstrated by superior grades in coursework as well as the development of professional dispositionsappropriate to teachers.FacultyM. Costello, Chair; K. Alaimo; C. Fojtik; P.N. Kirstein; A. Lopez; G. Peck; R. TaylorAdmission to DepartmentFor admission as a major in one of the department's programs, a student must have completed at least six (6) credit hoursin the intended major with a grade-point average of 2.5. The student must also have an overall grade-point average of 2.5.Interested students should apply for admission to the department chairperson. Once admitted to the department, studentswill be assigned an advisor with whom they should consult each semester about their course of study. Department majorsand minors must earn a grade of C or better in all major courses, all general education courses and all professionaleducation courses. Courses in which a student earns a grade of D will not count toward the fulfillment of departmentprogram requirements except by written permission from the department chair.History MajorsThe immediate objective in studying history is to gain an understanding of what happened in the past. Such anunderstanding is essential for comprehending how society has evolved, and for critically reflecting upon both theaccomplishments and limitations of today's world. The study of history involves acquisition of knowledge andunderstanding, cultivation of perspective, and development of communication and critical-thinking skills. Learning toassess the credibility of evidence and to formulate interpretations based on evidence are central concerns in the studyof history. Historical skills are useful in preparing for many professions. Majoring in history can help students preparethemselves for careers in secondary teaching and for graduate study. The major provides excellent preparation forstudents planning careers in law, government service and journalism. History students also find career opportunitiesin museums, libraries, archives, tourism and travel, historical preservation, business research and marketing. Finally,the study of history is an essential part of liberal education, encouraging critical and responsible citizenship and lifelonglearning.The history (HIST) major is a 36 credit hour program that provides a general grounding in the historical discipline forstudents seeking a liberal education.*All courses are 3 credit hours each unless otherwise noted.Requirements for the History MajorDepartmental Requirements (36 credit hours)*NOTE: 9 credit hours count toward University General Education requirements in history and social sciences.Required Courses (18 credit hours)•-2019179Requirements for the Political Science MajorDepartmental Requirements (30 credit hours)*NOTE: three credit hours count toward University general education requirements in social sciences.Required Courses (12 credit hours)•-2019181•-2019183Capstone (6 credit hours)The capstone project will be the senior project or thesis in either Communication (-2019185Public Administration MinorStudents must complete 18 credit hours as follows:Required Courses (12 credit hours)•-2019187take responsibility for their learning, both by having to negotiate criteria appropriate for an honorsdesignation and by developing a creative plan within the course framework.5.Honors Capstone Project, 3-6 credit hours.

The faculty in the Language and Literature Department iscommitted to exploring the inextricable links that exist between language, literature and rhetoric in the contexts mostrelevant to students, and they work closely with their majors to offer courses that deliver a rigorous and purposefullearning experience. The department offers four majors for students to choose from, two with alternate concentrations:•An English major with a choice of two concentrations:•Global literatures•Rhetoric and writing•An English Secondary Education major for students preparing to teach grades 9-12•A Spanish major with a choice of two concentrations:•Spanish language, Literature and Civilization•Spanish for the Professions•A Spanish Education major for students preparing to teach grades K-12In addition, the department offers minors in English, writing, Spanish and Latino/Latin American Studies.When students engage in the study of language and literature, they encounter the very expression of human experienceand humane values and gain insights into what it means to be a citizen of the world. Throughout their undergraduatecareer, our students learn about the significant cultural, historical, political, and sociological forces that drive the creationand evolution of language and literature over time; indeed, they come to understand language and literature as productsof the society that creates them rather than a monolithic expression of the individual. In essence, the Language andLiterature Department provides its majors with the tools needed to succeed in a world in which information proliferatesendlessly, a world in which knowing how to interpret and evaluate the words, images, and texts that abound will help themto navigate the society in which they live.FacultyA. Bonadonna, chair and English education coordinator; K. Kaiser Lee, writing program director; S. Ambrose; N. Boyer; J.Gutowski; A. Karim; G. Rossetti; M.B. Tegan; O. Vilella, Latino/Latin American studies program directorEnglish and English Secondary EducationEnglish, like every language, is more than a means of communication. It is both a way of thinking about the world anda world in itself, a place where the imagination and intellect combine to teach us about the most important subject ofall: ourselves as human beings. The study of English in both majors of the department promotes study, reflection, andappreciation of language, literature, and rhetoric in this larger sense. How do the words, the thoughts, the persuasions,and the stories of our cultural heritage lend insight into what it means to be human?Over the years, majoring in English has been a route to rewarding careers in business, publishing, education, law, andgovernment. The reason for this success is simple: employers have come to realize that English majors have learned tobe innovative, articulate critical thinkers. They also realize that as society continues to grow more technical and complex,key personnel will be needed to help people communicate with each other. As long as we depend upon language to makeourselves understood and to get things done, majoring in English will always be practical.The English secondary education major integrates a full professional program with the department's linguistic, literary andrhetorical foundations. The best teachers of English are also scholars of English -- and the most empowered teachersare those who can navigate the mandates of the profession from the perspectives of a scholarly formation while alsounderstanding the art of teaching young adults.Majoring in English also leads to a wide variety of professional graduate programs. Master's and doctoral programs inEnglish accept students who want to prepare for college teaching and research. Historically, law schools have drawn theirstudents from both political science and English. MBA programs and medical schools have also begun turning to majorsfrom the liberal arts, such as English, for students. The English major at Saint Xavier University is flexible enough to allowfor the addition of those basic courses in business or science needed for admission into professional programs.LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE DEPARTMENT188WWW.SXU.EDU / SAINT XAVIER UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019189All English and English secondary education majors at Saint Xavier University begin their course of study by takingintroductory coursework in literary and rhetorical theory and practice.

It recommends courses to better prepare students for the Law School Aptitude Test(LSATs) and provides advising, mentoring, various activities and resources to support academic and career planningefforts.Saint Xavier University provides a Pre-Law Handbook (PDF) for students considering the legal profession, or legal study,and for candidates applying to law school. This handbook (PDF) is designed to help students at every stage of theirundergraduate studies at SXU.A legal career can be a rewarding profession. At its best, legal practice challenges the intellect, demanding the exercise ofreason and judgment. The ethics of the profession requires attorneys to promote justice, fairness and morality; thus, legalcareers can bring particular satisfaction to those who seek to work to promote social justice within the law.Recommended Courses for Pre-Law StudentsAccording to the American Bar Association, there are no recommended undergraduate majors or groups of coursesdesignated as "pre-law" education. Students are admitted to law school from almost every academic discipline. However,undergraduate students who consider entering a law school and pursuing a legal career are encouraged to take an areaof study that interests and challenges them, while taking advantage of opportunities to develop their research and writingskills. An excellent way to prepare for a legal education is to take a broad range of difficult courses. These courses includethose which cultivate and enhance basic skills of analytic problem solving, critical reading, writing, oral communication,general research, and task organization and management. Also strongly recommended are those that offer a broadunderstanding of history and the development of American society, a fundamental grasp of political thought and thecontemporary American political system, some familiarity with mathematics for financial and evidentiary analysis, a basicunderstanding of human behavior and social interaction, and fundamental knowledge of international institutions, worldevents, and globalization.The following courses are highly recommended; many of them may be taken as part of general education coursework.For Basic Skills•-2019215Psychology DepartmentThe Psychology Department 's curriculum offers to students the opportunity to study in the field's core domains: biological,developmental, cognitive, and social.

With a bachelor's degree in psychology, thestudent might expect to find work in such fields as education, sales, marketing, social work, social services, real estate,data analysis, public relations, administration and many more.Earning a bachelor's degree in psychology also may position students for further study at the graduate level. For instance,by earning a master's degree, students may pursue employment in community counseling, school counseling, marriageand family therapy, management, and other occupations in public and private industry. Many graduate programs inpsychology require students to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) for admission. Students consideringgraduate training are therefore encouraged to take courses in skill areas emphasized by the GRE. These skill areasinclude language/verbal skills, mathematical skills and analytic skills.FacultyT. Ritchie (Chair); C. Broadbridge; J. Deisinger; J. Miller; A. Pirlott; E.

In addition, the departmentoffers a minor in biology and a secondary education licensure in biology. Biology majors are prepared for advancedstudies in graduate or professional schools, or to use their biology training in the workplace after graduation.Each student majoring in the biological sciences is assigned an advisor in the department. Together the student andadvisor plan the program that will best meet the professional goals of the students. Students graduating with a B.S. inbiology must maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA in their biology coursework.Courses in biology utilize the diverse resources in the Chicago area, including museums, zoological parks, naturepreserves and Lake Michigan. Students may take classes that are offered through the Associate Colleges of the ChicagoArea (ACCA) consortium. Saint Xavier University is a member of the Reis Biological Station consortium. Membershipallows faculty the use of the station for field trips/courses and gives the SXU student access to all summer field coursesoffered by any of the consortium schools.

Who can vote? Who makespolicy decisions? Will we go to war? Have universal health coverage? Subsidize loans for college students? These are alldistributional, and hence political, questions. As Harold Laswell put it, politics is about "Who gets what, when and how?"Political science focuses on both institutions and behaviors to explain how social power is distributed, and how that poweris used to distribute other goods.The study of political science is vital to a liberal arts education. Through a critical encounter with political structures andprocesses, we learn to think critically, to develop and evaluate arguments and to remain open to new ideas. Throughreflection on significant events, ideas, movements and passions that have shaped the political world, we come tounderstand better our own values, to refine our beliefs.Majoring in political science prepares students for careers in public administration, politics, journalism, education, non-governmental organizations, public relations and business. It is an excellent major for those considering law school.The political science program offers students a well-rounded undergraduate education within the discipline. Coursesare offered in all the major sub fields of the discipline: U.S. government, international relations, comparative politics andpolitical philosophy.

Mathematics serves as aninvestigative tool for the natural sciences, social sciences, business, education and psychology. It also plays an importantrole in the development of human thought. Mathematics forms the bridge whereby the student enters the realm of abstractand precise scientific thinking.The Mathematics Department offers three major programs of study: mathematics (MATH), actuarial science, andmathematics with secondary education licensure (MATH/SED). Decisions concerning the nature of each student's studyof mathematics are made with particular attention to previous preparation and individual educational plans. Students whomajor in mathematics are prepared for entry into graduate schools as well as entry into business and industrial positionsthat require a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Students who major in Actuarial Science will be prepared to take the firsttwo Society of Actuaries exams (P-probability and FM-financial mathematics). Students who major in mathematics withlicensure in secondary education fulfill the requirements for teaching high school, middle school, or junior school levelmathematics. Courses in computer science, natural science, physics and business may be taken to fulfill the applicationrequirement of each program. The department also offers a minor program of study in mathematics that will complementmany majors at the University, especially majors in business, computer science, education and science.FacultyA.
