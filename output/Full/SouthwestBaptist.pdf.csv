Students may choose from a variety of programs of study as they pursue a liberal arts based, career-oriented education.  The University is comprised of six colleges: Robert W. Plaster College of Business and Computer Science, College of Science and Mathematics, the College of Education and Social Science, The Courts Redford College of Theology and Ministry, the Geneva Casebolt College of Music, Arts and Letters, and the Mercy College of Nursing and Health Sciences.  Areas of certification and professional areas of study are also offered.  Mission of the University (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, May 1997) Southwest Baptist University is a Christ-centered, caring academic community preparing students to be servant leaders in a global society.  Vision Statement (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, October 2003) Southwest Baptist University fulfills its mission with specific care to guard its Christian distinctives and Baptist heritage as it demonstrates continuous improvement; enlarges its ministry through consistent growth in student enrollment, retention, and ethnic and racial diversity, markets the institution and its mission regionally and nationally; fosters an environment of open communication and service to others; and cares for employees through competitive compensation and benefits packages.  Core Values (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, October 2003) In fulfilling the University’s mission and vision through its strategic planning process, Southwest Baptist University is committed to the following core values:  Christian Distinctiveness Southwest Baptist University is Christ-centered.  From its inception, the University has been a distinctively Christian and Baptist institution in terms of worldview and ideological commitments.  A Christian worldview which is grounded in the Old and New Testaments contains these beliefs:   God is creator and sustainer of the universe and the ultimate source of all truth, beauty and moral value wherever they are found.  Humanity chose to rebel against God and lives in a fallen state which he or she is incapable of righting.  God sent His Son, Jesus the Christ, to pay the penalty for the sin of mankind. He died on the cross and was resurrected on the third day. All who repent of their sin and put their trust in Jesus are delivered from the eternal consequences of sin.  God both judges and redeems humanity, thereby inviting men and women to define their relationship with Him, with fellow human beings across the globe and with history.  All people are to be treated with respect and dignity since they have been created in the image of God and have innate worth.  Human beings have sufficient capacity and freedom of will to develop their intellectual, physical, social, psychological and spiritual well-being.  Christians are to be change agents in society, sharing the Christian message and lifestyle; Christians are responsible for their relationship with God, with fellow human beings and with their environment.  Christians must exercise responsible citizenship.    4 Southwest in Profile 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    Baptist Heritage Southwest Baptist University has a long history of association with Baptist work, both in Missouri and throughout the world. The academic foundations of the University are built upon historical Baptist traditions. The implications of this tradition for Baptist higher education are:  The acknowledgment of God as the ultimate source of all knowledge and truth.  The commitment to scholarly endeavor under God.  The desire for open inquiry and responsible scholarship, and the freedom to promote the results of this scholarship.  The freedom of others to hold and to promote differing scholarly views consistent with a Christian worldview.  The acknowledgment of an ongoing relationship with the Missouri Baptist Convention. Compassion and Care for SBU Family  Southwest Baptist University is a caring community.  Scripture teaches that all people, regardless of their socioeconomic, physical, mental or spiritual condition, are individuals of worth in the eyes of God.  It exhorts Christians to look out for the welfare of other people, to be good stewards of the possessions God has given and to be honest with one another.  The University values all members of the University family and seeks to demonstrate the highest standard of respect for people exemplifying a Christian commitment to living with one another.    Academic Excellence Southwest Baptist University is an academic community.  Southwest Baptist University pursues excellence in teaching, scholarship and service by encouraging each member of the University community to live a Christ-centered life:  Treating each person as an individual valued by Christ;  Integrating liberal arts, research and professional studies;  Preparing students through appropriate educational and ministry opportunities to meet the challenges of a global society; and  Integrating Christian faith and biblical values within each academic discipline in accordance with the University's Baptist heritage. The University recognizes that academic excellence can be achieved only through continuous evaluation and assessment of curriculum, teaching and student learning.  Social and Spiritual Development Southwest Baptist University encourages the social and spiritual development of the University family, preparing servant-leaders for the global society.  The University recognizes a responsibility to assist all members of the University family to grow spiritually, intellectually and emotionally.  The University responds to that responsibility by offering opportunities for education, ministry, encouragement and worship.  As a distinctively Christian and Baptist institution, Southwest Baptist University believes it should demonstrate how the life-values commanded in Scripture can be integrated with academic instruction.  These values include sensitivity to the needs of the larger community; a commitment to justice, mercy and personal integrity; a desire for moral growth; and a sense of mutual accountability.  The moral values of the University are guided by an understanding of Scripture and a commitment to its authority regarding all areas of Christian faith, learning and living.  An important aspect of social development and servant leadership is a commitment to service.  Service and engagement at SBU promote learning beyond the classroom and encourage faculty, staff, and students to exemplify a caring academic community.  Service and engagement activities can be defined as those that share the love of Christ, contribute to the public and university good, promote community and civic involvement, enrich scholarship and research, or improve the quality of life for others.  Personal Wellness The University recognizes its responsibility to assist all members of the University family to establish and maintain personal wellness.  Scripture clearly teaches the importance of the body as the temple of the Holy Spirit, and the University values personal wellness as a necessary component of servant-leadership.  The University responds to its responsibility by offering opportunities for education and activities conducive to personal wellness.         Southwest in Profile 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 5    History of the University  The University first opened its doors in 1878 in Lebanon, MO, as Southwest Baptist College.  In 1879 the college was chartered by the state of Missouri and moved to Bolivar.  Early writings recount a legacy of sacrificial giving and extraordinary efforts by Baptists in southwest Missouri to establish and maintain the college.  The founders, James R. Maupin and Abner S. Ingman, faced many difficulties as they rode horseback seeking funds, students, and an ideal college site.  The college faced many hardships in its early years and actually closed from 1908 to 1913 to regain financial solvency and to recover from a devastating fire that destroyed the college’s only building.  The efforts and prayers of area supporters and Missouri Baptists brought results, and the college reopened in 1913 as a two-year junior college.  The University has maintained its strong Baptist heritage through its affiliation with the Missouri Baptist Convention, which provides some financial support for the University and elects the 25-member Board of Trustees which governs the institution.    The Missouri Baptist Convention approved plans in 1964 for the college to become a senior liberal arts college.  The first baccalaureate degrees were awarded in 1967.  Bolivar citizens donated a 102-acre farm on the southern edge of the city that allowed the college to expand physically beyond the small 10-acre campus located near downtown as part of its growing academic expansion.  Another milestone occurred in 1981 when the college name was changed to Southwest Baptist University.  In 1995 the University entered a joint nursing education agreement with St. John’s Regional Medical Center in Springfield, MO, to form St. John’s School of Nursing of Southwest Baptist University and in 2003 this program was elevated to College status.  Today, SBU is a thriving higher education institution with more than 3,600 undergraduate and graduate students.  The 158-acre main campus is located in the southern portion of Bolivar, a community of about 10,000 residents that serves as the county seat of Polk County.  There are 38 buildings on the main campus.  The University also operates branch campuses in Mountain View, Salem, and Springfield, MO.  The Southwest Commitment Statement of Doctrine (Formulated by a committee appointed by the President in 1979)  For more than a century Southwest Baptist University has been a community of trustees, faculty, staff, and students united in an experience of learning and living.  At this time we affirm our heritage and commit ourselves anew to Christian higher education.  Undergirding the following commitments is our belief that there is only one God, who is creator and redeemer, and that the world is sustained and ruled by Him.  We believe that God, the source of all truth, has given us His inspired word, the Bible, as the perfect treasure of divine instruction, the sole authority for our faith and practice.  We believe that the revelation of God through the life and teachings of Christ challenges us to become Christlike in all our endeavors.  1. We pledge a continuing commitment to a LIBERAL ARTS program from a Christian perspective, believing that each student needs a broad base of knowledge upon which to build larger concepts, including a Christian value system. 2. We pledge to communicate appreciation for our CULTURAL HERITAGE, providing experiences that develop aesthetic sensitivities and skills. 3. We pledge to continue PROFESSIONAL AND PRE-PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS, including those for both church-related and secular vocations. 4. We pledge ourselves to ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE as a goal.  We believe that we have the responsibility for developing scholarly competence and participating in professional activities. 6 Southwest in Profile 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    5. We pledge to WORSHIP GOD as an expression of personal reverence and public witness to the world because we believe that both private and corporate worship are essential experiences for maturing Christians. 6. We pledge to encourage SPIRITUAL GROWTH through personal Bible study and through local church and college ministries. 7. We pledge to SHARE OUR FAITH.  We believe that each Christian during and after college years is charged with making disciples. 8. We pledge to support MISSION OUTREACH in the local churches and throughout the world. 9. We pledge to practice and teach STEWARDSHIP of time, talent and material resources. 10. We pledge to promote the development of INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY to equip one for making academic, social, financial and spiritual decisions. 11. We pledge to be a CARING PEOPLE, a community in which students form lasting friendships and learn principles upon which to build Christian homes, because we believe in the dignity and worth of the individual. 12. We pledge to emphasize PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING.  We regard a balanced diet, exercise, personal cleanliness, recreation, and rest to be important to physical and emotional health. 13. We pledge to train our students in COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP. 14. We pledge through PRAYER to seek God's guidance and strength to fulfill these commitments. Because we are not only a Christian university, but also a Baptist university, we pledge to continue our support of the Southern Baptist Convention and Missouri Baptist Convention programs and Baptist principles.  Principles and Expectations (Adopted by the Board of Trustees, February 1994)  As a distinctively Christian and Baptist institution, Southwest Baptist University believes it should demonstrate how the life-values commanded in Scripture can be integrated with academic instruction.  These values include a sensitivity to the needs of the larger community; a commitment to justice, mercy, and personal integrity; a desire for moral growth; and a sense of mutual accountability.  The moral values of the University are expressed as ethical standards and are guided by an understanding of Scripture and a commitment to its authority regarding all areas of Christian faith, learning, and living.  Because of the prevailing moral confusion in our society, the University must speak clearly about Christian ethical standards.  Five statements of ethical standards have been adopted by the Board of Trustees for the University family, which is composed of students, faculty, staff, administrators, and trustees.  These standards concern Academic Integrity, Christian Lifestyle, Sexual Conduct, Marriage and Family Responsibility, and Respect for People and Property.  These statements of ethical standards guide the University in its obligations to students and others in the University family who are involved in an honest pursuit of the truth by requiring integrity in academic pursuits, by encouraging a Christian approach to sexuality, by supporting a stable family life, and by modeling responsible Christian interpersonal relationships.  The University is committed to providing education and counsel to those of its community; to extending Christian love to those involved in strife, marital discord, or the struggle for proper sexual expression; and to demonstrating the acceptance of the forgiveness for human failure, which is available through Jesus Christ.  Statement on Academic Integrity PRINCIPLE: Truthfulness, diligence and commitment are part of the very nature of God.  God's plan for believers is that their nature will become like His.  Because of this, our lives should demonstrate these qualities.  Scripture commends personal integrity and condemns that which undermines it. EXPECTATION: Academic integrity is based on truthfulness and is the responsibility both of faculty and students.  Faculty members are responsible for maintaining integrity in their academic pursuits.  Faculty members also have the responsibility for setting and clarifying academic requirements for the work of students.  Academic integrity is a personal responsibility of students to represent as their own work in reports, papers, or examinations only what they are entitled to present honestly.  Academic integrity also includes the collective responsibility of faculty members and students to ensure that all uphold the spirit and letter of this principle.  Conduct which violates academic integrity includes cheating in any form on examinations and presentations of the ideas or writings of others without proper credit.    Southwest in Profile 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 7    Statement on Christian Lifestyle PRINCIPLE: Scripture teaches that believers are set apart to God's purpose through sanctification, but will sin.  Scripture also demands that believers demonstrate a lifestyle that is distinctively different from that of non-believers. EXPECTATION: A Christian lifestyle is expected of all members of the University family.  It consists of demonstrating those attitudes produced by the gift of the Spirit, practicing truthfulness in all relationships or activities, and exhibiting our dedication to Christ through our commitment to excellence in daily work or academic activities.  A Christian lifestyle avoids such specific sins as greed; jealousy; pride; lust; bitterness; uncontrolled anger; prejudice based on race, sex, or socioeconomic status; use of alcohol as an intoxicant; substance abuse; stealing; profanity; dishonesty; occult practices; illegal activities; use of pornography; and sexual sins, such as pre-marital sex, adultery, and homosexual behavior.  Statement on Sexual Standards PRINCIPLE: Scripture teaches that heterosexual union is the only acceptable expression of sexuality and must be reserved for marriage and insists on sexual abstinence for those who are unmarried. EXPECTATION: All members of the University family should abstain from unbiblical sexual practices and from behavior which may lead to a violation of God's standards on sexual activities.  Statement on Marriage and Family PRINCIPLE: God's ideal for marriage is a lifelong covenant between one man and one woman.  Scripture views marriage as a witness to the permanent relationship between Christ and His Church and the family as God's first institution. EXPECTATION: The University has a concern over the increasing pressure being placed by external and internal forces on the institution of marriage.  It recognizes the struggle of those within the University family who strive to keep their marriages stable under these pressures.  Nevertheless, members of the University community should not enter into divorce except under the most severe circumstances and then only after pursuing all possible options, including counseling, and after considering the impact of divorce on their families, their personal lives, and their professional responsibilities at SBU.  Statement on Respect for People and Property PRINCIPLE: Scripture teaches that all people, regardless of their socioeconomic, physical, mental or spiritual condition, are individuals of worth in the eyes of God.  Scripture also teaches that ownership of property is to be respected.  It exhorts Christians to look out for the welfare of other people, to be good stewards of the possessions God has given, and to be honest with one another. EXPECTATION: The University expects behavior from all members of the University family that demonstrates the highest standard of respect for people and property and that exemplifies the Christian commitment to loving one another.  Certain behaviors are not acceptable according to this ethical standard.  These include sexual harassment, disrupting the rights of others to pursue appropriate University activities, depriving individuals of the use of their property or depriving the University of the use of its property.

Eight-week summer term: eight-week term having 31 days of class and final exams 3. Winterfest/four-week summer term: three or four week term having 15 days of class and final exams The following refund policy relates to the above structure and is applied to both online and seated courses: Financial Information 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 21      16-week 8-week 3-week or 4-week Prior to first day of class 100% 100% 100% During first 5 days of semester or term 100% 100% 75% During next 5 days of semester or term 75% 75% 50% During next 5 days of semester or term 50% 25% 0%  Classes may meet on a regular basis throughout the week or on a once-per-week basis.  This policy counts class days as if all classes were meeting each week day.  If a term or semester begins on a Tuesday then the first five class days are counted as that first Tuesday through the following Monday.  If a term or semester begins on a Monday, the first five class days are counted as that first Monday through Friday.  If a term or semester begins on a Monday and a student’s first course of the term or semester has its first class on that Friday, for purposes of the refund calculation, by the end of that Friday, the first five days of the term will have expired.  Withdrawal dates for online classes are determined by the last date the student logged into the course.  For purposes of the refund calculation, if the last log-in date is on a weekend, the last date of attendance is considered to be the previous Friday.   Other classes that meet on a term that is not defined above (one weekend, etc.) will be allowed a 100% refund if the withdrawal occurs before the first class.  Withdrawals during the term will be proportionately based on the fall/spring chart.    Special Circumstance Tuition Refunds Students may request the special circumstances refund withdrawal calculation if they must withdraw for the following reasons: 1. Illness, certified by a physician (copy of physician's request to withdraw required) 2. Students called into active military duty (copy of orders required) The tuition, room and board charges will be refunded based on the percent of the term attended.  Financial assistance will be cancelled based on institutional and federal policies. (Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid for further details).  The Special Circumstance Request Form must be submitted prior to the end of classes for the term in which the special circumstance occurs.  Cancellation of Federal Financial Assistance Students who have been awarded federal financial assistance from the University and withdraw from school or cease to attend classes are subject to the cancellation of their federal financial assistance and the removal of the awards previously credited to their accounts.  Non-attendance of classes does not constitute official withdrawal from the University.  Students must complete the official withdrawal process through the University.  Applicable refunds for students receiving federal and/or state financial aid funds will be calculated in reference to the student’s last date of documented attendance.  Warning:  Students who drop classes during the institutional refund period which causes their enrollment to be other than full-time status will be considered ineligible for full federal financial assistance awards.  Federal financial assistance credit will be removed from a student's account in accordance to the lower number of credit hours.  Cancellation of federal financial assistance will be made in accordance with current federal regulations and will be processed by the Office of Financial Aid.  For information concerning the current federal financial assistance cancellation policies, students should contact the Director of Financial Aid.  Cancellation of Other Financial Assistance and Scholarships Scholarship and other institutional awards are subject to cancellation and the removal of credit from the students account if they withdraw from school, cease to attend classes or are deemed ineligible due to their status of less than full-time.  22 Financial Information 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    (Exception: Students attending other than the Bolivar campus may be eligible to receive limited private scholarship awards if attending less than full-time.)   Before dropping a class or withdrawing from school, students should consult with their academic advisor, and contact the Office of Financial Aid to determine the financial impact of their decision.   1. Dropping Classes Students who drop a class during the institutional refund period will lose eligibility for scholarships, should that dropped class put them below the hour requirements as specified for that scholarship.  2.

"
CFR 668,".16(e)]  These measurements shall be used to determine a student’s eligibility for all federal Title IV aid and for other need-based financial assistance, unless the terms of a particular grant or funding source states otherwise.  Degree seeking students in all graduate programs are covered under this policy.  (SAP) will be reviewed at the end of each academic year, and you must be meeting SAP standards or you will either be placed on Financial Aid Warning, Financial Aid Probation, or Financial Aid Suspension.  Students on Financial Aid Suspension may be eligible to appeal their suspension. The academic policy at Southwest Baptist University is designed to enable students to achieve the degree requirements for graduation.  Degree requirements for graduation include a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 at the time of program completion.  Satisfactory academic progress (SAP) is, therefore, measured by qualitative and quantitative standards to promote this outcome.  All students must meet the requirements of both quantitative and qualitative satisfactory academic progress listed below to receive financial aid. Quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress – Students must complete 67% of the number of credit hours for which they have enrolled to remain eligible for federal financial aid.  To establish a quantitative measure, a time frame is set for students to finish a program of study.   Financial Information 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 23    Qualitative Satisfactory Academic Progress – At the end of the academic year, the student must have achieved a cumulative GPA of 2.000 or greater to maintain SAP. Additional SAP Information Maximum Time Frame – Regulations require the maximum time frame to not exceed 150% of the published length of the program, measured in the required academic credit hours.   Withdrawals, Repeats and Incomplete Grades – Courses dropped after the drop/add period will count towards attempted hours.  Repeat courses for which the student has previously earned credit will not count towards hours completed.  However, they will count towards hours attempted even if credit was not previously earned.  The highest grade will be the grade that counts towards the GPA calculation.  Credit hours for courses for which an incomplete or deferred grade is granted will not count as hours completed but will count towards hours attempted. Transfer Students – Transfer students are accepted from regionally accredited colleges and universities on the basis of transcripts and satisfactory student records. Credits may be granted upon the approval of the Academic Department and the Office of the Registrar.  Transfer students who are admitted and do not meet our quantitative and/or qualitative standard will be notified that they are on probation for their first semester. Evaluation Period – A student’s academic progress will be evaluated at the end of each academic year.  Academic years for Graduate students include fall and spring terms.  Summer is only included if the student is taking a summer course.  Financial Aid Warning – A status a school assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress. The school reinstates eligibility for aid for one payment period and may do so without a student appeal. This status may only be used by schools that check SAP at the end of each payment period and only for students who were making SAP in the prior payment period they were enrolled in or who were in the first payment period of their program. Financial Aid Suspension – Once a student has been placed on Financial Aid Warning, failure to meet SAP will place them on Financial Aid Suspension.  Students on Financial Aid Suspension may be eligible to appeal their suspension. Financial Aid Probation – A status a school assigns to a student who is failing to make satisfactory academic progress and who successfully appeals. Eligibility for aid may be reinstated for one payment period. Academic Dismissal – Students under academic dismissal are not eligible to receive financial aid and are not eligible to appeal until they have been reinstated to the University.  Reinstatement to the University does not guarantee financial aid eligibility or appeal approval. Appeal – A process by which a student who is not meeting SAP standards petitions the school for reconsideration of his eligibility for FSA funds. Automatic Termination of Aid Eligibility – Default on a federally funded student loan will result in automatic termination of aid eligibility. SAP Appeal Process  Students who have been notified that they are on Financial Aid Suspension will be required to complete a financial aid appeal.  The first appeal, if approved, places the student on financial aid probation status and they are eligible to receive financial aid.  A second appeal places a student on financial aid probation and they must complete the appeal process again with supporting documentation. The student is eligible to receive financial aid for an additional semester but must meet stipulations outlined in the appeal decision (e.g., limited hours or repeating course to raise GPA).  Students who fail to meet SAP requirements for three consecutive semesters are no longer eligible to receive financial aid.  If a student is making progress on their academic plan but is still below the SAP requirements, a student can be granted extended probation status and continue to receive financial aid as long as appeal stipulations are being met. Failure to make progress and/or failure to follow the academic plan will result in an appeal being denied and loss of financial aid eligibility. 24 Financial Information 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog     Extenuating circumstances include the death of a family member, illness or injury, or other circumstances beyond the student’s control. Appropriate supporting documentation of the circumstance must be provided. Students may not use the same extenuating circumstance for multiple appeals without sufficient documentation of ongoing issues.  Appeals must include a statement from the student explaining why they did not meet the SAP requirements, what has changed to allow them to meet the requirements in the next semester, an academic plan completed by the student and the advisor, and a statement from the advisor.  Students who have reached the maximum timeframe due to switching majors, second majors or additional degrees, will be evaluated on a case by case basis through the appeal process.  Incomplete appeals will not be reviewed.  Reestablishing Financial Aid Eligibility Students may reestablish eligibility by enrolling in one or more semesters and successfully completing the course(s) without the assistance of financial aid. When a student’s cumulative SAP progress is at or above 67% and they have met the required GPA for hours earned, then he or she will once again become eligible to receive financial aid. Disbursement of Funds Policy Acceptance and authorization to credit Federal funds to the student’s account is given by the award letter process.  Funds are credited to the student’s account on or as soon as possible after the first day of class assuming the student has been determined eligible and completed verification if necessary.   Work Opportunities  Graduate Assistantships As a service and commitment to graduate level education on the SBU Campus, the university supports the placement of quality graduate students in employed campus positions to secure real life work experience. Graduate assistants will be employed using campus employment student guidelines as directed by human resources. Graduate assistants will work no more than twenty hours per week and will receive appropriate remuneration in the form of an hourly wage and/or tuition concessions. For more information about Graduate Assistantship availability please contact the Office of the Provost for further detail.Student Life 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 25      STUDENT LIFE  All graduate students are required to abide by the following University regulations and expectations. Students should contact the appropriate graduate program director for clarification of student life regulations.  Student Responsibility  The goal of campus life at SBU is to provide a Christian community of faith and learning.  Life in such a community brings many privileges, but it also carries responsibilities.  By virtue of their enrollment at SBU, students agree to accept responsibilities of membership in the University community.  As conditions of admission, the University reserves the right and power to discipline or dismiss any students who fail to accept this responsibility.  Each student agrees that the University shall have this right and power of discipline or dismissal. Upon using the University Libraries or other libraries with which agreements are maintained, students agree to accept certain responsibilities.  Students are responsible for knowing these responsibilities and policies.  Each year the SBU Student Handbook is updated and a library guide describing services and regulations is available at the Hutchens Library reference desk.  Discipline Any member of the University community may assume responsibility for upholding University standards of conduct.  Normally, the first approach should be to advise or counsel students about the alleged misconduct.  When counseling is unfeasible or ineffective or in cases of serious violations, referral will be made for more formal counseling or disciplinary proceedings.  Guidelines for disciplinary action, along with the procedure for disciplinary appeals, are outlined in the SBU Student Handbook.  Misconduct Students should refer to the SBU Student Handbook (Student Portal Page – Menu (top left) - Student Services - Student Handbook) or (http://www.sbuniv.edu/_resources/documents/student-handbook.pdf#search=SBU%20student% 20handbook) for information regarding misconduct.  Student Housing The University provides student housing in campus dormitory and apartment facilities during the summer sessions and regular semester sessions.  In order for a student to request dormitory or apartment housing, a housing contract must be completed and returned to the Office of Student Life by the student prior to arrival on the Bolivar campus. Housing accommodations will be provided on a first-come first-serve basis.  Housing information is available through the Office of Student Life.  Prices for room and board are for actual school days and do not include holidays or periods between terms.  Graduate students must make a $100 housing/enrollment deposit if they are full-time fall or spring semester students.   Any damage for which the student is responsible will be charged to his/her account or deducted from the housing/enrollment deposit.  Cancellations must be made 14 days prior to the beginning of the semester.  If the cancellation is received after this time the housing/enrollment deposit will be subject to forfeiture.  Students who cancel housing reservations before the fifth day of classes during the fall or spring semesters will receive a 90% refund of semester housing charges.  Students who cancel housing reservations after the fifth day of classes will not receive a refund of semester housing charges.  Local motels are available in the Bolivar area for those students not wishing to stay on campus during short summer sessions.  Students are responsible for making their own hotel arrangements. 26 Student Life 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog     A variety of meal plan options are available for those students not living on campus but desiring to eat in the  Mellers Dining Commons, Sports Café, and/or Kaldi’s Coffee Shop.  For more information, contact the Office of Student Life (417-328-1885) and/or the Fresh Ideas office (417-328-1542) or visit http://www.sbuniv.edu/campus-life/living/food-services.php .  Automobiles The State of Missouri requires motorists to carry public liability and property damage insurance.  Students from other states who bring automobiles to campus are urged to carry this insurance.  Each student operating an automobile must display the University vehicle permit and obey University and community regulations regarding the care and use of an automobile.  Parking permits may be picked up from the Safety/Security office.  There is no charge for a parking permit.  Parking permits are issued each academic year beginning with the fall semester.  The permit may be used during the fall, spring, and summer terms.  Parking permits must be displayed on the left side of the rear window of a vehicle. Tickets are issued for unidentified cars parked on campus.  Disabled or otherwise handicapped persons may obtain a handicap parking decal, good for any authorized parking space, provided that approval is documented by the University Health Center.  Disabled permits may be obtained from the Physical Plant office.  For more information concerning parking on campus, please see the brochure “Motor Vehicle Regulations" available at the Safety/Security office or in college/department offices.  Student Identification Card Each student is required to obtain a student identification card for identification and library purposes from the Office of Safety and Security.  No charge will be made for the original card.  The card is revalidated each semester of enrollment.  The revalidation sticker is required for each semester of enrollment and is available from the accounting office.  If a replacement identification card is needed, the student will be assessed a $25 replacement fee and may pick up the replacement at the Office of Safety and Security during regular office hours.  Student identification cards are important for library use, entrance to the dining hall on campus, access to the campus computer network, and access to some university buildings.  Student Services Counseling Students at Southwest Baptist University have available to them one part-time and one full-time Licensed Mental Health Professional to assist with personal and emotional issues.  This service is offered without direct cost to students of Southwest Baptist University. The Counseling Center offices are located within the Behavioral Sciences Department on the second floor of the Gott Education Center.    Career Services The office of Career Services is available to assist students and alumni with career counseling, career assessments, resumes, cover letters, mock interviews and guidance through the job search process.  Career Services is located in the office suite of Mabee Chapel.    Student Health Services Southwest Baptist University offers a student health service which provides medical services for minor illnesses or injuries on a walk-in basis during the hours of operation.  This service is extended to all undergraduate students through the health fee (optional for all graduate students not in the Physical Therapy program).  The only charge made to the student is for Student Life 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 27    laboratory work.  The health center uses a referral system with local doctors when necessary.  SBU offers no student health services for students at the Branch Campuses.     The student is responsible for expenses incurred for ambulance service, calls at a local physician's office, emergency services, and other services provided by any local hospital where students may be taking classes.  All international students accepted for admission to Southwest Baptist University are required to purchase a12-month medical insurance policy from a United States based company prior to campus arrival.  Once medical insurance is purchased, the student must provide documentation verifying the health policy to the University Health Center.  A 12-month medical insurance policy must be maintained while the international student is attending SBU.  Academic Advising Each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor in the degree program the student chooses.  The advisor will assist the student in planning his/her program of study and adjusting to the academic demands of graduate studies.  Goodson Student Union The Felix Goodson Student Union is a center for student activities available for graduate and undergraduate students.  Included in the Union are the Kaldi’s Coffee, CatSnack student lounge, game room, student leadership offices, bookstore, the Office of Student Life, University Ministries, and Davis Theatre.  University Bookstore The University Bookstore, located in the Goodson Student Union, carries a complete stock of textbooks, selected trade books, supplies, and many items for personal use.

Student Organizations  Education Students in the Master's Certification program are encouraged to join the Student Missouri Student Teacher Association.  Information is available in the Office of Teacher Education.  Nursing and Health Professions The Student Organization of Health Professionals (SOHP) is a college-wide organization for students attending Mercy College of Nursing and Health Sciences.  This interdisciplinary organization is designed to enhance student leadership and service learning opportunities while attending MCONHS.  Group projects are planned throughout the year using an interdisciplinary teamwork approach.  All students become members of SOHP upon admission to the college, however participation is voluntary.  The SBU Nursing Honor Society is an organization designed to enhance continued scholarship, networking, and expand professional nursing practice in Southwest Missouri.  It invites membership to outstanding graduating nursing students and community members.  The overarching goal is to expand clinical scholarship, leadership, and continuing education opportunities to SBU Nursing Alumni, current SBU MSN nursing students, and SBU Nursing Honor Society members.  Physical Therapy Students in the physical therapy program are encouraged to join the American Physical Therapy Association.  The SBU Student Physical Therapy Association is a student organization open to all students in the professional physical therapy program.  University Life and Ministry  Graduate students are not required to fulfill the Community Life and Worship requirement.  However, graduate students are invited to participate in this spiritual experience. A listing of Community Life and Worship and Global Connections opportunities may be seen at http://www.sbuniv.edu/campus-life/spiritual-life/clw.php . Academic Regulations 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 29      ACADEMIC REGULATIONS  Grades A graduate student completing a graduate course at Southwest Baptist University will receive a final grade in the course of A, B, C, F, P, IP, or I.  A student must receive a grade of C or higher in each course on the approved program of study.    Graduate students completing the M.S. in Education or Educational Administration or the Education Specialist may only have six (6) hours of C on a graduate-level transcript.  Students with more than six (6) hours of C must retake these courses with Southwest Baptist University.    Credit earned by OLIS will not be applied toward graduate degree requirements. Work experience may not be applied as credit toward graduate degrees.  Incomplete Grades An incomplete (I) grade may be given when a student is doing passing work or has the possibility of earning a passing grade but is unable to complete all of the course requirements because of unusual circumstances acceptable to the instructor (such as illness or accident).  In no case may an “I” be agreed to unless the student has completed at least eighty percent of the class.  An “I” may not be used to permit a student to repeat a course or to improve a grade.  The instructor must complete the Application for Incomplete Grade form and it must be signed by the instructor and submitted to the appropriate department chair and college dean for approval.  The completed and signed form must then be filed in the Registrar's Office; additional copies of the form will be given to the student, instructor, academic advisor and the college dean.  Requirements for completing the course and appropriate grade designations are to be specified on the application by the instructor.  It is the responsibility of the student to satisfactorily complete all of the course requirements within one year.  If the incomplete is not cleared within this specified time limit the “I” will be changed to an “F.”  In-Progress Grades An In-Progress (IP) grade may be given for courses that usually require more than one semester to complete; e.g., readings, projects, internships or practicum courses.  Requirements for completing the course and a specific completion date are to be specified by the instructor on the application.  The In-Progress Grade form must be signed by the instructor and submitted to the appropriate department chair and college dean for approval.  The completed and signed form must then be filed in the Registrar's Office; additional copies of the form will be given to the student, instructor, academic advisor and the college dean.  It is the responsibility of the student to satisfactorily complete all course requirements, under the supervision of the instructor, by the specified completion date.  If the In-Progress grade is not cleared within this time limit, the IP will be changed to an appropriate letter grade based on the completed work.  If there are extenuating circumstances beyond the student's control, the student may request a time extension through the special academic request process.  Academic Integrity [Conduct and Academic Integrity Policy (adopted 01.31.13)] Graduate level education is a rigorous and exciting challenge. It brings with it many requirements for which the student is ultimately responsible. By accepting a position in a graduate program at Southwest Baptist University, the student voluntarily agrees to uphold the ideals, standards, and regulations set forth by the University and to respect the principles and traditions it upholds as a church related institution of higher learning. The student is responsible for all published academic integrity standards in the respective handbooks and catalogs of the department and the university. It is expected 30 Academic Regulations 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    that the student will uphold the highest level of integrity and submit original work(s) for evaluative purposes. The graduate programs collectively recognize established university conduct policies with special emphasis on class “C” violations (See SBU Student Handbook). Sanctions for conduct violations, depending on severity of the individual case, may include reprimand, disciplinary probation, suspension, immediate dismissal, and/or denial of privilege to re-enroll at the university.   Dishonesty hurts everyone and it should be a concern for the entire university community. Confronting and reporting academic dishonesty should be done in a manner most appropriate to the circumstances. Acts of dishonesty that occur within the online or seated graduate course and/or program should be reported to and managed by the appropriate person within the graduate department (instructor, department chair, dean).   Academic dishonesty is a class “C” offense and is subject to faculty sanctions which should be included in the course syllabus and may include any of the following: 1) Denying or reducing credit for an assignment or examination; 2) Requiring additional assignments and/or examinations, 3) Lowering the student’s course grade; and/or 4) Issuing a failing course grade.  Grade Appeal  In a case in which a student has a grievance regarding a final course grade, the student should first attempt to resolve the matter with the instructor.  If the grade dispute is not resolved at this level, the student may initiate a formal written appeal with the following provisions and/or guidelines: 1. Only the final overall course grade may be appealed.   2. No one may substitute personal judgment for that of the instructor in regard to the quality of the student's work; therefore, evidence must be shown of any deviation from established procedure that adversely affects the student in the assignment of the letter grade for the course. Deviation from established procedure is defined as assignment of a grade on a basis other than the student’s performance in the course, assignment of a grade to a student by more stringent or different standards from those that were applied to other students in the course, or the assignment of a grade that does not align with the grading scheme outlined in the syllabus. 3. The appeal must be initiated within six weeks of the start of the succeeding regular academic semester (fall or spring) from the end of the course that is being appealed. 4. Any grade appeal must be submitted in writing using the Grade Appeal form obtained from the Registrar's Office. 5. The formal appeal begins when the student presents the Grade Appeal form to the instructor for his/her signature. 6. The chain of appeal is: i. The student meets with the instructor to discuss the grade.  If agreement cannot be made the course instructor should sign the grade appeal form for the student who will then submit the form to the department chair. ii. The department chair/program director and dean shall collect information related to the grade appeal and meet separately with the instructor and the student.  If the department chair/program director and dean are in agreement that the grade should be overturned for the reasons outlined above then the they should change the grade and submit the form to have the grade changed immediately to the Registrar.  If the department chair/program director does not agree that the grade should be overturned then they should sign the form and give a copy to the student.  iii. If the student wishes to pursue the appeal further, they should submit the form to the Provost with a request for a full grade appeal panel.   The first two of the above stages should occur within 20 school days (days must occur within a regular semester, fall or spring) of the initiation of the appeal.    If the instructor of the course is the department chairperson or program director, the student may elect to initiate the formal appeal directly to the appropriate dean.  In unusual cases in which the course is taught by the dean, the student may elect to submit the grade appeal to the Provost who will convene the Grade Appeal Panel.  Any request for a review by the Grade Appeal Panel should be made within 20 school days (within a regular semester) of the most recent appeal decision.  This request is made by taking the Grade Appeal form to the Office of the Provost.  The Provost will send the form and any related written statements to the Chair of the Academic Advisory Committee. Academic Regulations 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 31    7. The Grade Appeal Panel is to consist of three faculty members selected at random from the current Academic Advisory Committee; however, faculty members from the department or college being affected are not to be members of the panel.  If the grade appeal is for a graduate level course then a member of the graduate council will also serve on the Grade Appeal Panel in lieu of one member of the Academic Advisory Committee.  The chairperson of the panel is to be selected at random from the panel chosen.  The Grade Appeal Panel will meet in closed session after the formal hearing for further discussion as necessary.  The Grade Appeal Panel will make its final recommendation to the Provost by simple majority secret ballot.  Both the instructor and the student should be prepared to appear before the Grade Appeal Panel to present their cases formally.  Witnesses may be called to support any evidence presented.  A faculty member from the department affected may be called to answer any procedural questions.  The instructor and the student will appear separately before the Grade Appeal Panel to present their cases formally.  Additional parties attending the hearing will be limited to those who were witnesses to any pertinent events or can provide first-hand testimony of the essential facts of the case.  In addition, a faculty member from the instructor’s department may be called to answer any questions related to the standard operating procedures of that department.  At the discretion of the chair, the panel may separately recall either the student or the instructor to clarify any discrepancies in their respective testimonies.  In extenuating circumstances, as determined by the current chairperson of the Academic Advisory Committee, previous chairpersons of the Academic Advisory Committee may be called upon to serve on the Grade Appeal Panel. NOTE: This is the highest level of appeal.  No further appeal is possible.  8. The recommendation of the Grade Appeal Panel will be forwarded to the Provost for action, with the understanding that there will be no grade change without the explicit recommendation of the Grade Appeal Panel.  If the grade is changed, the Provost will complete and sign the Change of Grade form, which will be sent directly to the Registrar. 9. All of the appeal decisions are to be made within 24 hours of the conference or hearing.  The results of the grade appeal will be put in writing and sent to the student and the instructor within two school days.  The Change of Grade form will be sent directly to the Registrar.  The entire grade appeal process should be completed within 60 school days of its initiation, unless they span over summer or Christmas break. 10. An initiated formal appeal that is withdrawn may not be resubmitted. 11. Confidentiality is  maintained at all times in accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Appeal of Academic Probation and Dismissal A graduate student desiring to appeal the academic standing designation of probation or dismissal by a respective graduate unit should send a letter (either hard or electronic copy) to the Office of the Provost. The appeal letter must clearly state and explain: a. Any unexpected, unavoidable, or otherwise extenuating circumstances that prevented the student from attaining or maintaining necessary academic progress. b. What has been done by the student to prevent further academic difficulties? c. Any non-academic grounds by which the appeal should be considered. Appeal letters must be received at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the upcoming semester. The Graduate Council will review appeals normally within four weeks of confirmation of receipt of the appeal letter to Provost and prior to the start of the upcoming semester. The Provost will preside at the review session. The chairperson of the graduate unit will provide background information for each student's appeal. The student may be invited to attend the review session. A final decision by the Graduate Council will be made in closed session. The Graduate Council may uphold or rescind the original decision and specify the new academic standing placed upon the student. The advisor of the student, the chairperson of the graduate unit, and the student will be notified in writing of the decision of the Graduate Council. This is the final level of appeal available within the University related to academic probation and dismissal.    32 Academic Regulations 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    Graduation  In Absentia Students must participate in commencement unless absence is approved by the Provost prior to the ceremony.  The reason for not participating in commencement must be explained in writing to the Provost who will grant or to deny permission to be excused from commencement.    Walking Early In order to participate in a formal commencement ceremony, all the established components of a graduate degree plan must be completed as is established in the respective course catalog.

Engage in the professional practice expectations on a diverse patient and client population throughout the lifespan. 3. Educate and communicate with appropriate stakeholders in the health care environment. 4. Serve the profession and society to promote and improve evolving health care delivery. 5. Reflectively practice the art and science of physical therapy by critically evaluating, integrating, and contributing to the expanding professional knowledge base. 6. Formulate a plan for life-long learning coupled with professional, personal, and spiritual growth.  Assessment  Periodic measurements of student perceptions, intellectual growth, clinical performance, and professional behaviors development are obtained as one means for the University to assess and improve its academic programs and student learning.  The information obtained is used to measure and develop student competencies and to determine and improve the quality of the educational experience for students.  Students are required to compile and maintain a formal learning portfolio by which the student demonstrates progress towards and achievement of the established program goals by the end of the final year of the curriculum.  Admission Requirements  Physical Therapy Requirements The following requirements must be met before being admitted to the physical therapy program at SBU (courses in progress during semester(s) applying must be documented and completed prior to admission): 1.

Completion of the following support courses (not calculated into prerequisite GPA: a. Medical Terminology - one semester is required at a "B" grade or higher; one credit hour minimum expected b. Pathophysiology - not required, but highly recommended c. Exercise Physiology - not required, but highly recommended; students demonstrating successful completion of an exercise physiology course with a "B" grade or higher will be exempt from completing the exercise physiology component of the DPT program 8. International student need to contact the department or consult the SBU catalog for additional requirements, including the TOEFL exam Prerequisite science classes must be current. Completion of each course sequence must be within seven years prior to admission to the PT program. Exceptions may be granted only if the applicant can show that knowledge of the course content is current. Applicants seeking an exception must submit a written petition with rationale for approval.  In the case of repeat prerequisite grades, the department will use the “best case” scenario for determining eligibility; however, an application penalty would be applied by reducing the overall score for each repeat grade that was present on the transcript. The grade for any science courses repeated due to the seven year rule will be substituted for the old class regardless of the first grade received.  International Students Official records of all higher education, including certificates or degrees with the dates the degrees were conferred must be submitted. All records not in English must be accompanied by an official translated record. All records should show the individual subjects studied and the grades received in each subject. International applicants are required to submit proof of adequate finances for the entire period of study before admission can be granted. Eligible applicants whose native language is not English must take the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and attain a score of at least 550.  Transfer Students Students with previous course credit in a professional phase of a CAPTE accredited PT program will be considered for academic transfer into the professional phase of the SBU entry-level DPT program if: 1. the student completes and submits a current application 2. the application meets established minimum application standards for unconditional enrollment (as if they were enrolling for the first year of the program) and the new student will be subject to the following conditions or standards: 3. No prior PT school earned grades of less than a "B-" will be accepted for transfer credit. 4. The student will automatically be placed on normal "conditional" enrollment. 5. A maximum of 1 full year of academic credit may be transferred depending on the ability to match historic courses to pending courses in the normal SBU sequence (i.e. the student must successfully complete the second and third year of the normal DPT sequence). 6. All considerations are on a space available basis and by taking a transfer student, it is in the opinion of the faculty, that SBU academic standards are not compromised. 7. Potential transfer student may be required to provide extra or special documentation or interviews as deemed necessary by faculty in order to fully consider the application request. Students who have not taken the prerequisite courses should be advised to take the specific courses or equivalents. When those courses are not available at the college / university they are currently attending, course substitutions may be allowed under the following guidelines. All substitutions submitted with the application must be made in writing and include a course syllabus or adequate description to determine equivalency. Applicants who have taken the specific prerequisite course but want to substitute another course with a higher grade may be able to do so only when the substitute course is an advanced course covering the same content. Course substitutions may be allowed when the content is met or exceeded.   Specific course substitution considerations will be handled as follows:  74 College of Science and Mathematics 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    General Chemistry - Upper level chemistry courses (e.g. organic or biochemistry) which require General Chemistry may be substituted assuming higher level sequence is completed (prior approval not required). General Physics - Upper level physics courses (e.g. calculus based) may be substituted assuming higher level sequence is completed (prior approval not required). Biology – General Zoology may also be substituted (prior approval not required). Upper level human- or animal-based biology course(s) containing appropriate content for PT may be substituted pending approval. Anatomy / Physiology - only human, comparative, or vertebrate anatomy / physiology from a science-based department (e.g. biology, zoology, anatomy, physiology) may be substituted (prior approval not required). Any other course(s) must have prior approval. Applied anatomy / physiology from non-science based departments may not be substituted. Statistics - Course meeting or exceeding expected foundational content may be substituted only if from social science, business, or math based department (prior approval not required). Psychology - Out of department substitutions will only be considered if the university does not have the expected psychology prerequisite courses from a psychology based department.  CLEP/Advanced Placement Considerations In some cases, college credit is given for coursework (e.g. CLEP, Advanced Placement) and an actual grade is not recorded. Credit will be given if needed to meet an admissions requirement, however, if no transcripted grade can be produced, it will be omitted from GPA calculations. General Admission Process Applicants must apply to the Physical Therapy Program. Students must complete the courses required for entry into the program and complete a Baccalaureate Degree in another field prior to admission to the Physical Therapy Program. Students may have courses in progress in the Spring or Summer semester prior to enrolling in the physical therapy program but all requirements must be completed prior to enrollment. Important admission dates include the following:  July 1:   Begin receiving applications.  September 1:  Begin reviewing applications (Early Decision considerations). October 1:  Begin reviewing applications (General Pool) August: New physical therapy entry-level DPT class begins in mid-August. Students accepted into the entry-level program in physical therapy will be enrolled full-time in professional graduate courses for 33 consecutive months to finish with a Doctor of Physical Therapy degree.    Admission to the University does not guarantee admission into the graduate physical therapy program. Application priority points will be given to SBU undergraduate students and recognized undergraduate articulation school students.  Ranking of applications will consider criteria including as established by the core faculty as follows: -prerequisite grade point average (30%), -overall grade point average (8%), -references (15%), -observation experience (4%), -written essay\narrative (5%), -preferred attendance (8%), -graduate record exam (30%)  Applicants are strongly encouraged to communicate frequently with the Graduate Admissions Coordinator and schedule an individual visit to campus. Starting with the initial review date, applications will be acted upon on a rolling basis and designated into one of the following categories with appropriate notification to the applicant:  1. selected for unconditional admission into the program (i.e. met all admission criteria);  2. selected for unconditional admission into the program contingent upon outstanding action items (i.e. has currently met most admission criteria with the exception of a few items, which in the opinion of the committee will not make a major negative impact upon the overall status of the application. Outstanding items must be successfully completed prior to admission in program); College of Science and Mathematics 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 75    3. placed on a waiting list to be considered for unconditional admission as space is available; 4. placed on an alternate list including but not limited to conditional enrollment status (i.e. the applicant failed to meet the established minimum GPA standards and is then scored and ranked in the applicant alternate pool. It is expected that beginning on or close to March 1 of each year, after the unconditional applicant pool has been exhausted, that applicants from the alternate pool will be considered for admission to the program);  5. held for subsequent review pending the submission of further requested or outstanding material; or 6. denied admissions.   A student may decline SBU acceptance a maximum of one time. If student wishes to re-enter the pool for another application cycle, they must first appeal directly to the department chair establishing appropriate grounds that their new application should be considered.  A student who is dismissed, denied the privilege of re-enrollment, or voluntarily leaves the program for any reason, and wishes to re-enter the program, must first appeal in writing to the department chair establishing appropriate grounds that their application and/or re-entry should be considered. The department chair will present appeal to core faculty for final decision (2/3 vote needed to approve).  High School Early Acceptance Program Selected High School students are eligible to apply on a competitive basis for early acceptance into the physical therapy program subject to the following parameters and guidelines:  1. Earn a 24 ACT or equivalent SAT score (1090). 2. Submit a completed High School Early Acceptance (HSEA) application with appropriate supporting evidence and documentation. 3. Should be a graduating high school senior or collegiate freshman with less than 30 completed undergraduate hours at the time of application. Note: This provision is aimed to not penalize students from taking dual credit courses in advance of regular collegiate admissions as an incoming freshman. 4. Once accepted into the HSEA program, all undergraduate classes must be taken at SBU with the successful awarding of a bachelor’s degree. The spirit of this provision is not to prevent the student from taking an occasional summer or correspondence course from a different college or university.  5. HSEA recipients must confirm their intent to matriculate into the professional phase of the physical therapy program by the end of January in their intended enrollment year and pay appropriate deposit. 6. Must submit current overall graduate program application. 7. HSEA recipients must earn an overall GPA of 3.00, a prerequisite GPA of 3.25, and a minimum grade of a “C” in all prerequisite courses or else forfeit their acceptance. The prerequisite GPA will be calculated with the first-time attempted course grade. Withdrawals will be considered an “F” grade. Under special circumstances, a withdrawn course can be petitioned, reviewed by the admissions committee, to be retaken for prerequisite GPA consideration.   8. Document 40 hours of observation or work hours in a physical therapy setting. 9. Participate in 50 hours of community service. 10. Complete "

Prerequisite: none. "
KIN 3073," Exercise Physiology with a minimum grade of a “B.” Note: These courses are considered support courses and are not used to calculate prerequisite GPA. Courses may be retaken if needed to earn the required grade level. 11. HSEA applications should be submitted to the department for consideration for the upcoming fall semester: 1) on or before the middle of November or January for students participating in SBU Scholars Day, or 2) before the first of April for students not participating in SBU Scholars Day. A maximum of 20 awards will be given during any one academic year. If the 20 slots are not filled during the first selection cycle, a late cycle pool will be considered during February of the academic year just prior to the selection cycle for the next academic year. If slots are not filled for any one academic year, they will not roll over or be extended. The physical therapy department recommends the completion of one of the following undergraduate degrees: Biology, Exercise Science, or Psychology. Students should carefully plan their undergraduate experience such that most prerequisites are completed prior to their senior (or application) year. Students electing to take non-recommended degree paths should make those considerations for other specific purposes and with the knowledge that those elections may increase the duration of their undergraduate experience prior to entering the physical therapy program. If there are ever any questions about the most effective and efficient undergraduate path toward entering the graduate physical therapy program, please contact the program directly. 76 College of Science and Mathematics 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog     Eligibility for awarding the HSEA is established at the point of SBU undergraduate graduation and all normal requirements must be completed at the time of recognized graduation. Successful HSEA participants will receive a scholarship upon entering the professional phase of the physical therapy program subject to the following parameters and guidelines: 1. Students will receive credit for the scholarship by attending and documenting mentoring sessions on a semester basis during their undergraduate semesters (max 8 semesters). The scholarship amount will be earned at a rate of $375 per regular semester (Fall, Spring) enrolled at SBU in which student attends the mandatory mentoring sessions. 2. The total scholarship is awarded in 3 equal installments upon entry to the SBU physical therapy program (i.e. first year, second year, and third year in equal $1000 amounts resulting in a “discount” on the annual tuition). 3. The award is not distributed as a cash award. 4. If the student does not accept the HSEA enrollment into the SBU physical therapy program, the award becomes null and void. 5. If the student does not merit entry to the SBU physical therapy program under the established guidelines as a HSEA participant, the award becomes null and void. 6. A deferment of up to 2 calendar years after earning of a bachelor’s degree from SBU may be granted upon request of the HSEA participant who otherwise meets established guidelines. The spirit of this provision is a variance given to HSEA participants who meet unexpected life events beyond their control. 7. Once enrolled in the professional phase of the program, the HSEA participant must meet established unconditional matriculation requirements or the remaining award distributions will be forfeited. A+ Recruitment Program The Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) program at Southwest Baptist University realizes and appreciates that the cost of earning a valuable degree continues to increase and this cost factor does play a role in the decision-making processes on where students elect to attend college. The program wishes to support Missouri A+ students who have a professional goal on becoming a physical therapist by establishing a path by which they can complete their A+ requirements and earn an automatic acceptance into the SBU DPT program.  A+ Recruitment Program Requirements 1. Successfully earn an Associate’s degree based on the existing parameters of the A+ program 2. Earn a Bachelor’s of Science degree from SBU in Biology 3. Have the following prerequisite courses completed by B.S. graduation and present on the transcript with at least a minimum grade of a “B” in each course (combined prerequisite GPA should be 3.25)^#: a. Biology* – one semester, human or animal-based with lab component b. Chemistry* – two semesters with lab component c. Physics* – two semesters with lab component d. Anatomy and Physiology* – two semesters with lab component e. Statistics f. Three psychology courses – general, normal growth, abnormal development g. Medical Terminology – housed in  Physiology of Exercise   ^Repeated courses will be reviewed by the admissions committee for evaluation of acceptance. It is the general guideline that courses should not be repeated unless extreme circumstances are presented. #Course in Pathophysiology is highly recommended, but not required. *Courses must be taken in sequence from a science-based department. Degree Requirements  Doctor of Physical Therapy To receive the DPT degree the student must: 1. complete all the physical therapy courses and practical exams with at least a C, and have a minimum graduate GPA of 3.00; College of Science and Mathematics 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 77    2. pass all clinical education courses;  3. earn a final passing grade on learning portfolios; and 4. participate in commencement exercises unless absence is approved by the Provost. Program of Study and Academic Regulations  Student Orientation New students enrolled in the physical therapy program attend two full days of orientation at the beginning of their first year. At this time, they receive a Physical Therapy Student Handbook which includes the policies and procedures for the graduate program in physical therapy. Students are responsible for all materials presented in the respective handbooks.  Clinical Education The purpose of the clinical education component within the physical therapy curriculum is to ensure student carry-over and integration of didactic course work into the clinical setting. To ensure a broad range of clinical experiences, each student will be required to have a clinical experience in acute care, outpatient orthopedics, and neuro-rehabilitation. These experiences appear late in the curriculum totaling 34 weeks in a residency-like format. One of the final clinical education experiences may be in an area of special interest within physical therapy that has not already been experienced by the student in a prior clinical experience. Students are responsible for all expenses for travel and living during the clinical education experiences. Students with a history of criminal actions documented on a background check may have clinical education placement options severely limited or delayed. While student input to the assignment process is valued and considered, we cannot guarantee these requests for clinical assignments will be met. The final decision rests with the Academic Coordinator of Clinical Education (ACCE), with input from the Core Faculty, and the student should be readily prepared to attend a rotation that may not have been a top preferred position on the part of the student.  Specific clinical education policies and requirements are delineated in the Physical Therapy Student Handbook.

Master of Arts in Christian Ministry  Mission of the Program  The mission of the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry program is to prepare men and women who are called to the ministry to apply theological studies to kingdom initiatives that build up the Church and contribute to the welfare of the community.   Vision of the Program  The Master of Arts in Christian Ministry is a practical theology degree.  In contrast to undergraduate programs, in which the curriculum is divided along the lines of theoretical and practical studies, the graduate program in Redford College is thoroughly integrated, combining theological studies and ministerial studies in every course.  The intent and purpose of this integration of theory and practice is to train and equip students to apply theological knowledge to practical ministry initiatives in fruitful and innovative ways.       Admission Requirements and Academic Regulations  Students may be admitted to the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry program according to the following classification categories:   1. Fully Admitted – The student meets all admission standards, has completed all prerequisites, and has been admitted to the program of study.  2. Conditionally Admitted a. Contingent Admission  –  Students who have not completed the academic program prerequisites are conditionally admitted to graduate study.  All students admitted to the 4+1 track will be contingently admitted.  Students admitted to the 4+2 track who have completed less than thirty hours of coursework in the relevant areas (see Prerequisites, below) will be contingently admitted.  (Students must have 86 The Courts Redford College of Theology and Ministry 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    completed at least eighteen hours of coursework – including nine hours in the areas of biblical studies, theology, and philosophy; and nine hours in the area of ministry – to be considered for contingent admission to the 4+2 program.)  Students contingently admitted to the program will have their status changed to “Fully Admitted” if/when their prerequisites are completed.  Students may take no more than twelve semester hours of graduate courses without satisfying program prerequisites.   b. Academic Probationary Admission  –  Students whose grade point average is less than 2.75 overall or 3.00 in their undergraduate majors are conditionally admitted to the program.  At the end of their first semester, or the completion of nine hours of graduate work (whichever comes first), students probationally admitted to the program will have their status changed to “Fully Admitted” if the grade point average for their graduate coursework is 3.00 or higher. Students who fail to meet this benchmark may be dismissed from the program.  The final decision either to dismiss a student from the program or to extend the student’s probational period will be made by the Graduate Program Director, in consultation with both the Dean and the student’s advisor.    3. Non-Degree-Seeking Admitted – The student meets all admission standards, has completed all prerequisites, and desires to take some courses in the program for credit, but does not intend to pursue the degree.  Students admitted to non-degree-seeking status may at a later time petition the Graduate Admissions Committee, in writing, to have their admissions status changed to a degree-seeking status (either Fully Admitted or Conditionally Admitted).  Such petitions are not automatically granted, but will be decided by the Graduate Admissions Committee.  (Note: Students who wish to take courses for personal enrichment, but not for credit, may audit courses in the program without meeting admission standards or completing the prerequisites.)    The following is required of students seeking full admission to the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry program:  1. Bachelor’s degree from a regionally accredited college or university;   2. Minimum undergraduate grade point average of 2.75, overall, and 3.00 within major (on a 4.00 scale).   In addition, applicants to the program must submit the following materials:  3. Completed “Application for Graduate Admission” to the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry Program; 4. Official transcripts from all colleges, universities, or seminaries attended; 5. Graduate Admission Essay; 6. Three letters of recommendation that speak to the character and academic ability of the applicant: one from a college professor, one from a pastor or mentor, and one from a fellow member of the applicant’s church.  As noted above, admission to the 4+1 track is a contingent admission.  Those applying to the 4+1 program while undergraduates at SBU must submit the same materials listed above (items 3. – 6.)  However, in the case of incoming freshmen who are applying concurrently to the SBU undergraduate program and to the 4+1 track of the graduate program in Christian Ministry, a letter of recommendation from a high school teacher may be submitted in place of a letter from a college professor, and high school transcripts may be submitted in place of college or university transcripts.    International Students International students must meet the admission requirements for the M.A. program.  Official records not in English must be accompanied by an official translated record.  All records should show the individual subjects studied and the grades received in each subject.    Prerequisites The Master of Arts in Christian Ministry program requires that students have prior knowledge in certain areas of study before fully pursuing the M.A.  The purpose of these prerequisites is twofold: (1) to promote a greater likelihood of student success in completing the program; (2) to facilitate instructors of graduate courses in designing course content (establishing reasonable expectations concerning the background knowledge of students enrolling in the courses).  To satisfy each prerequisite, students must have completed the course or an approved equivalent from a regionally accredited institution, having earned a grade of C or better.      The Courts Redford College of Theology and Ministry 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 87    The prerequisites for the M.A. in Christian Ministry are as follows:  Either (i) a major in biblical studies, theology, philosophy, ministry, intercultural studies, Christian studies, or religious studies, or (ii) 30+ hours of undergraduate coursework (2000-level or above) in these areas.    The coursework completed in the aforementioned areas must include the following courses or some transfer equivalency:  "

Violation of the SBU Drug and Alcohol Policy.  Attendance Class attendance is mandatory. The student is responsible for attendance at all class sessions and meetings. A pattern of repeated absence or tardiness will be reported to the faculty advisor and may result in development of a remediation plan by the PT Review Committee. Students must notify the instructor directly in writing (e.g. email) or by calling office in advance for any absence except for emergency or unavoidable circumstances. If the instructor is not available when the student calls, a voice message should be left. In the case of unavoidable circumstances, students must contact the instructor on return from absence and if possible, prior to the next class session to ensure completion of assignments. Additional assignments may be required. Faculty will give make-up exams and modify deadlines for assignments only for excused absences with appropriate documentation. The student is responsible to get notes for any class missed whether excused or unexcused. Students missing 3 unexcused lecture or lab sessions during the regular fall or spring semesters, or 10% of total class hours in Jan term and summer courses will have their course grade reduced by one letter grade.  Each additional missed lecture or lab will result in an additional letter grade reduction. For tabulation purposes, lecture and lab sessions are counted as individual sessions (even if on same day). Any student who is late for class will be counted as missing a minimum of 1 class hour. Course specific policies are determined by each instructor and must be in compliance with the SBU Catalog and SBU Student Handbook.  The student may request excused time off for special once in a lifetime events (e.g. weddings; graduations) only if by missing the scheduled class, the otherwise unexcused absence would have a detrimental impact on a course grade (e.g. at least lowering of final course grade by one letter).  Appeals The faculty of the Department of Physical Therapy realizes that occasionally some circumstances may prevent a student from performing optimally in every course during each term. Any student wishing to appeal a decision by an individual faculty member or by the Physical Therapy Review Committee or Department Chair must first appeal to the decision maker then to the next level within the department. If the student is not satisfied with the Department's decision, he/she may appeal as described in the SBU graduate catalog. The grade appeal process is described in the SBU graduate catalog. It is plausible that the successful appeal process creates a natural delay in matriculation due to the lockstep nature of the curriculum. Under rare circumstances, a student who was normally admitted to the program, is discovered to either knowingly or unknowingly mislead, misrepresent, or falsify elements related to admission standards. If this circumstance is discovered, regardless of when it is discovered, the status of an enrolled or admitted student is automatically revoked and the student forfeits any rights to appeal and any claim on monies already paid to the institution in the form of tuition and fees.  Official Communications All official notices from the department will be sent to the official student local address on file with the university and/or the official SBU email provider. College of Science and Mathematics 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 81    COURSE DESCRIPTIONS  . .

Students must also submit an individual learning portfolio for formal annual assessment and earn a final passing grade at the end of the curriculum.  Students earning a grade of “F” or “non-credit” in any given course will not be able to enroll in courses listing the failed course as a prerequisite. Any student who is unable to meet these requirements is subject to review by the Physical Therapy Review Committee which will in consultation with the student, determine a plan for further action which may include academic probation with a specific plan for remediation or dismissal from the program.  College of Science and Mathematics 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog 79    Students will be expected to satisfactorily pass each practical examination and course. Students having difficulty will meet with course instructor and advisor to determine a plan of remediation. The Physical Therapy Core Faculty will, as part of the curriculum/program evaluation, monitor the standards.  Graduate level physical therapy repeat courses are permitted only under the supervision and recommendation of the PT Review Committee for remediation purposes. Students passing a physical therapy course will not be permitted to retake the course for academic grade or transcript purposes unless otherwise directed by the PT Review Committee. If the course is successfully repeated (as defined by the PT Review Committee), then the new earned grade will replace the previously earned failing grade for matriculation and transcript purposes and the previous grade will not enter into grade point average (GPA) calculations from that point forward. The Registrar will replace the original earned failing grade with a designation that the original grade was failing, but has now been successfully repeated (e.g. RF).  Exams will be based on course objectives. Criteria for projects, papers, and/or assignments will be stated in the syllabus for the students. Criteria and determination of grades for each course will be established by the core or adjunct faculty member who is leading the course. The policy and expectations of each instructor will be stated in writing in the class syllabus and explained to the class within the first few class sessions.

Program of Study  The Master of Arts in Christian Ministry is a non-thesis, 42-hour degree, culminating in a Ministry Project Capstone.  The program is designed for students who have (or are seeking) a bachelor’s degree in Christian ministry, biblical studies, intercultural studies, Christian studies, religious studies, theology, or philosophy, and who desire advanced study in ministry in order to serve the Church more purposefully.    Students must complete four CORE courses (12 hours), nine electives (27 hours), and the Ministry Project Capstone (3 hours). The program of study will be designed by the student and faculty advisor, informed by the student’s ministry goals and the courses offered.  A typical full-time student will enroll in nine to twelve credit hours per fall and spring semester (with 88 The Courts Redford College of Theology and Ministry 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    a reduced course load for the final semester, in which the Ministry Project Capstone takes place), three credit hours per summer term, and three credit hours per Winterfest term.  No more than twelve credit hours of graduate coursework will be allowed in a single semester.    There are two tracks for pursuing the M.A. degree in Christian Ministry: a “4+1” track and a “4+2” track.   The 4+2 track is for students who have already graduated with a bachelor’s degree.

Students may concurrently enroll in up to twelve hours of specially designated upper-level Redford courses that will count for both their undergraduate and graduate requirements (see Concurrent Enrollment Courses, below).  The following is a typical program of study for those on the 4+1 track:  Second semester junior undergraduate (80+ hours completed)  Spring: 3 hours (concurrent enrollment) Senior undergraduate Fall: 3 - 6 hours (concurrent enrollment)  Spring: 3 - 6 hours (concurrent enrollment) First year graduate Summer: 3 hours   Fall: 9 - 12 hours  Winterfest: 3 hours  Spring: 9 - 12 hours Summer: 3 hours (Ministry Project Capstone)   Concurrent Enrollment Courses SBU undergraduates who have been admitted to the program (4+1 track) and have completed 80+ hours of coursework and all course prerequisites are eligible to enroll concurrently in the following courses.  Students who successfully complete these courses will receive both undergraduate credit (appearing on the student's transcript as a 3000 or 4000 level course credit) and graduate credit (appearing on the student's transcript as a 5000 level course credit).  Students may earn up to twelve hours of graduate credit through concurrent enrollment.

MIN 5983,") and project serves as both an application and a substantive assessment of what the student has learned from the Master of Arts in Christian Ministry program.  It is comprised of an in-class component and an off-site component.  The former is a team-taught course involving regular meetings throughout the semester in a classroom setting.  The latter is a student-designed project, developed in consultation with the student’s advisor, the Graduate Program Director, and an on-site supervisor at a church or parachurch organization where the ministry will take place, and guided and evaluated by the student’s Capstone Committee.   Initially, the project proposal will be developed by the student and presented to his/her advisor at the time of the portfolio review.  The portfolio review must take place within two weeks of the beginning of .  The portfolio consists of all major assessments, including midterm and final papers, along with any exams that the student was allowed by his/her professors to keep.  The student will discuss the portfolio with the advisor, addressing in particular the issue of how the proposed ministry capstone project will build upon the body of knowledge and work that the students has completed up to that point.  The proposed ministry project must involve a minimum of 200 hours of field work, and the proposal must include a timetable for completion of the project.   90 The Courts Redford College of Theology and Ministry 2018-2019 Graduate Catalog    Once the advisor is satisfied that the project is viable and well-conceived, the student will consult with the Graduate Program Director, who will either approve the project, or, if the project is judged to be deficient in some way, send the student back to the advisor for further consultation.  In the event of the latter, the Director’s reservations must be expressed in writing, and copies sent to both the student and the advisor.  The process will then repeat until approval of the proposal is granted by the Graduate Program Director. Once the project has been approved, the student will begin the project in accordance with the agreed upon timetable.  Guidance for the project throughout, and evaluation of the project at its completion, will come from the student’s Capstone Committee.  The Capstone Committee is comprised of the student’s advisor, the  Graduate Program Director, and one of the faculty members co-teaching  during the semester in which the student’s project takes place.  (In certain cases, two of these roles could be fulfilled by the same individual, in which case the student’s Capstone Committee will be comprised of only two members.)   Immediate oversight for the project will come from a designated individual at the church / parachurch organization with which the student is working. Students must make arrangements with the organization for this oversight to take place, and details of the arrangement must be included in the proposal and thus approved by the student’s advisor and the Graduate Program Director. This on-site supervisor is not a part of the Capstone Committee, but will advise the Committee on the student’s progress and quality of work.  The supervisor will be asked to give a monthly report to the members of the Capstone Committee, who will consult with the student in the case of any concerns.  Further guidance will be provided by the classroom meetings of , in which ideas, insights, challenges, concerns, etc. associated with the students’ developing ministry projects will be shared, discussed, and addressed. At the completion of the project, the student will write up an evaluation / self-assessment of the project, and will then meet with the members of the Capstone Committee for a final review. Following the review, the members of the Committee will meet to decide on a grade for the ministry project / capstone course, which the Director will then report to the student.     The following is required for successful completion of the requirements of the Ministry Project Capstone: 1. Assemble a portfolio of all assignments for the M.A. program. 2. Create and implement a Master’s Ministry Project in a (typically local) church or parachurch organization. 3. Evaluate and present the Master’s Ministry Project.

Faith Integration  Faculty in the College are committed to the University and College mission statements, which explicitly direct instruction of the College disciplines from the context of a Christian worldview.  In addition to providing a strong and rigorous curriculum in each of our specialties, our duty as Christian scholars is to help frame both our discipline and the practice of that discipline within a biblical and more specifically, a Christian context.  This commitment to integrate discipline with Christian faith and practice occurs throughout the courses taught within the College.  Furthermore, the College has adopted Psalm 15 as a guiding principle for our students.  The College is specifically dedicated to producing “Psalm 15 Professionals” for servant leadership roles in business and computer science.  Using Psalm 15 as a basis, eight character traits that should be hallmarks of students and graduates of the College have been identified.  These character traits are highlighted each semester and include: Integrity, Service, Respect, Charity, Faithfulness, Truthfulness, Humility, and Perseverance.  Psalm 15 Lectures are held each semester featuring guest lecturers who speak on the specific theme for that semester and relate personal experiences that highlight integrity and a Christian worldview for business leaders.    Assessment  The College faculty believes assessing educational outcomes in business is important. Outcomes assessment is a way to evaluate College programs and academic achievement of students in relation to similar colleges.   Therefore, all graduates 102 Robert W.
