Most people in all societies learn and use their native language or languages with apparentease - but don't be fooled: languages are highly complex, and speaking and understanding languagerequires some amazing feats of mental acrobatics. Thus there are many opportunities for difficultieswith language, which is the focus of our field. Understanding difficulties with speech, language, andhearing require first understanding how processing works when language is successful - thepsychological (behavioral) and neurobiological (brain) factors that enable people to learn and uselanguage despite its intricacies, the structure and properties of language itself, and how knowledge oflanguage is acquired, represented, and processed in the mind and brain.PBH1Alexandra Boo, Alix KowalskiSeats (Total: 39)Th 6:30pm - 9:00pm"

Several bonding models arecovered, from the simple valence bond and ligand field models to a quantitative group theoreticaltreatment of molecular orbital theory and band structure descriptions of solids. Concepts of electroncounting and oxidation state and ligand characteristics are revisited in terms of the more sophisticatedbonding models. Finally, these models are used to analyze the reactivity, magnetic and spectroscopicproperties of inorganic coordination compounds.

This course investigates sustainability through comparing costs and benefits. Fromthis perspective, other questions arise: How can we design policies that incentivize sustainablechoices? Why might usual market functioning fail to achieve sustainability? Do we need to put a priceon the environment in order to protect it? How do we measure an economy's "success"? This courseexplores the answers to these and other related questions from an economist's perspective.0101Erin MoodySeats (Total: 20)MW 2:00pm - 2:50pmF 9:00am - 9:50amCON481Theory and Policy in Environmental EconomicsCredits: 3Grading Method: Regular,Pass-Fail, AuditPrerequisite: 1 course with a minimum grade of C- from (AREC326, ECON306, ECON326); and 1course with a minimum grade of C- from (ECON230, ECON321, BMGT230).

For the flow past ground vehicles, in theurban grid, re-entering rockets, helicopters landing on ships at sea and countless other examples, theflow is turbulent, and simulation is becoming or will one day become the methodology of choice inanalyzing and designing such technologies. The goal of this course is to give an introduction to theanalysis of turbulent flow via simulation and the modeling that is used in its development. Among thequestions to be considered: What can one hope to learn from flow simulation? What are the strengthsof the approach and what obstacles inhibit its application? What kind of physical considerations arerequired in setting up simulations? How does one analyze the results of a simulation?0101Peter BernardSeats (Total: 10)MW 11:00am - 12:15pmR01Bongtae HanSeats (Total: 8)Class time/details on ELMsONLINERE01Bongtae HanSeats (Total: 3)Class time/details on ELMsONLINEENME701Sustainable Energy Conversion and the EnvironmentCredits: 3Grading Method: Regular,AuditRecommended: ENME633.

At UMD, the Fearless Ideas campaign asks us to aimour enthusiasm for technology at big real problems. At the same time, we are coming to appreciate theincreasingly complex nature of technological systems as they become integrated into all forms ofinfrastructure, we realize they may be unpredictable, interdependent on social and biological systems,and have unintended consequences. In this midst of this complexity, people make decisions with farreaching impacts. How then do we follow our passion for technology and innovation but also stayskeptical in a way that allows us to consider the potential and shortcomings of technology?

Specific topics vary.Some parts of language acquisition are harder than others. Among the hard stuff, there are some caseswhere children seem to face a learnability problem: they have incorrect representations that result intheir grammars generating all of the sentences that adult grammars do, but also other sentences thatadult grammars do not generate. It seems that children nevertheless 'recover' from this overgenerationstate. The question is: how? In this course we will examine cases of learnability puzzles that childrensomehow manage to recover from, develop hypotheses about how children do this, and planexperimental studies that would test these hypotheses.0101Andrea ZukowskiSeats (Total: 10)TuTh 3:30pm - 4:45pm"

Students will gain an understanding ofdifferent types of data and how they are created, as well as their relative strengths and weaknesses. Akey distinction is drawn between data that are designed, primarily survey data, and those that arefound, such as administrative records, remnants of online transactions, and social media content. Thecourse combines lectures, supplemented with assigned readings, and practical exercises. In the firstsemester, the focus will be on the error that is inherent in data, specifically errors of representation anderrors of measurement, whether the data are designed or found. The psychological origins of surveyresponses are examined as a way to understand the measurement error that is inherent in answers.The effects of the mode of data collection (e.g., mobile web versus telephone interview) on surveyresponses also are examined.0101Katharine Abraham, Frederick ConradSeats (Total: 25)Meets September 11, 2017 - December11, 2017M 3:30pm - 6:30pmURV623Data Collection Methods in Survey Research(Perm req)Credits: 3Grading Method: Regular,AuditPrerequisite: SURV400; or students who have taken courses with comparable content may contact thedepartment.Review of alternative data collection methods used in surveys, such as current advances in computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), and othermethods such as touchtone data entry (TDE) and voice recognition (VRE).SVW1Christopher AntounSeats (Total: 15)Meets August 28, 2017 - November 29,2017Tu 6:00pm - 6:50pmContact instructor or department for details.ONLINEThis online section is a condensed version of the on-site section.

Restriction: Permissionof BSOS-Joint Program in Survey Methodology department.Missing data are a common problem which can lead to biased results if the missingness is not takeninto account at the analysis stage. Imputation is often suggested as a strategy to deal with itemnonresponse allowing the analyst to use standard complete data methods after the imputation.However, several misconceptions about the aims and goals of imputation make some users skepticalabout the approach. In this course we will illustrate why thinking about the missing data is important andclarify which goals a useful imputation method should try to achieve.SVW1Jorg DrechslerSeats (Total: 8)Meets September 20, 2017 - October 12,2017W 12:00pm - 12:50pmContact instructor or department for details.ONLINEThis online section is a condensed version of the on-site section.

And must havecompleted a basic statistics course in regression modeling.  Restriction: Permission of BSOS-JointProgram in Survey Methodology department.Measurement error in survey data can significantly distort analyses of substantive interest. Means,totals, and proportions will be off if the average answer people give is inaccurate. However,measurement error distorts not only estimates of means but can also severely bias apparentrelationships, conditional probabilities, means differences, and other regression-type analyses. Toremove such biases it is therefore essential to estimate the extent of measurement error in surveyvariables. This can be done using a gold standard or, in the absence of such a standard, modeling theerror. This course introduces the latter and trains students to perform regression analyses without theinfluence of measurement error.SVW1Daniel OberskiSeats (Total: 8)Meets November 1, 2017 - December 1,2017W 12:00pm - 12:50pmContact instructor or department for details.ONLINEThis online section is a condensed version of the on-site section.
