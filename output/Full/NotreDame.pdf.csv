Outcomes. Students will be able to:  Analyze and use critical thinking to solve mathematical applications.  Solve problems with mathematical competency and a willingness to find multiple strategies.  Communicate mathematical concepts clearly both orally and in written form.  Use appropriate technology to solve mathematical problems.   Creative Inquiry. In a liberal arts college, students have the priceless opportunity to explore and hone their creative abilities.  The study of music, art, theatre, or creative writing stimulates the mind and fortifies the spirit.  Students learn about the elements, forms, and styles of different media.  By doing so, they understand themselves and their engagement with others critically, thoughtfully, and meaningfully.  Outcomes. Students will be able to:  Develop both creative and analytical thinking through the exploration of the creative process.  Define and apply the vocabulary related to the elements, forms and styles of the respective media.  Literary Inquiry. By examining literature, students learn not only different genres and forms of writing, but also the complexity and beauty of the English language, all while refining their inferential and critical reading skills. Reading literature encourages us to enter new, and often challenging, modes of thinking that in turn help us understand ourselves and our relation to the global community.  Outcomes. Students will be able to:  Explore the depth and breadth of the human experience expressed in the literature of a variety of genres, times and places.  Refine skills of inferential and critical reading.  Engage in thoughtful and reasoned conversation, as well as analytical writing informed by research.  Philosophical Inquiry. Philosophical inquiry introduces students to philosophical and critical thinking by exploring timeless questions that are central to a liberal arts education. Students acquire an understanding of fundamental philosophical questions that remain central to living a life of personal, professional, and global responsibility. Students further acquire interpretive and evaluative skills necessary for assessing answers to these timeless questions, along with an appreciation for philosophical self-reflection.  Outcomes. Students will be able to:  Demonstrate knowledge of the traditional themes in the discipline of philosophy, especially those relating to the human person and the liberal arts tradition, e.g., ethics, social philosophy, aesthetics, critical thinking, epistemology, and metaphysics.  Demonstrate an ability to interpret and analyze philosophical questions and proposed answers to them carefully and critically, using historical context and logical reasoning.  Demonstrate critical thinking and analysis skills in reading philosophical texts and participate in activities that encourage students to develop an appreciation for philosophical self-reflection, e.g., Socratic class discussions, debates, journaling, reflective essays.  Scientific Inquiry. Science is more than a body of knowledge; it is also a process by which one can systematically gain knowledge of the natural world. Students will engage in methodology or the process of scientific inquiry and critical thinking, both in a classroom and laboratory. 31   Outcomes. Students will be able to:  Describe how science is a process to gain knowledge of natural phenomena (through the scientific method).  Demonstrate factual knowledge in a specific discipline (depending on the course).  Explore the role of science in society.   Critically evaluate the validity of scientific claims.  Theological Inquiry. Theological inquiry opens students to sources that have helped humans answer life’s ultimate questions. Theology guides students to use sacred texts both from Christianity and other faith traditions, as well as use critical reasoning to examine the evidence of this world and the transcendent. Students will recognize their relationship with God, global communities and all God’s creation.   Outcomes. Students will be able to:  Demonstrate skill in examining theological assumptions about themselves and the world.  Assess some responses to timeless questions about God, morality, and the life hereafter.  Compare their own beliefs with those of others to grow in clarity and depth.  Apply values of social justice to critical global issues.

Philosophical thinking can be applied in any life situation because it teaches general problem solving, clear and persuasive communication, and writing that is ordered, coherent and complete. For this reason, one can argue that a philosophy minor is an invaluable compliment to any academic discipline. Careers that are especially dependent on philosophy and philosophical thinking include law, politics, the sciences, theology, journalism, communication, management and education.  Student Learning Outcomes Students completing a minor in philosophy will be able to:  Identify, comprehend, analyze and evaluate philosophical arguments in oral and written discourse.  Understand, analyze, interpret and apply major works in the areas of the History of Philosophy, Ethics and contemporary topics.  Be able to develop and express philosophical positions using the insights of philosophers and other thinkers.

Bachelor Degree Programs Major Fields of Study The academic major deepens the student’s knowledge in a particular field while meeting intellectual and career interests. Therefore, all Notre Dame College students must choose a major area of study.  Degree candidates are encouraged to choose a major by the end of the sophomore year. In order to fulfill all requirements in four years, some majors require enrollment in major courses during the freshman year. This situation is particularly true in the natural sciences, mathematics, accounting and education.  Some programs have both entrance and graduation requirements of a specific grade point average during the time of study. See specific programs for entrance and continuation GPA requirements.  Degree Completion Time Frames Degree requirements must be completed within 10 years of the date from which the student first matriculated at Notre Dame College. Earned credits over 10 years old will only apply to a degree if the grade for that credit is C (2.0) or better and when accepted as applicable by the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs or Division Chair.  Minor Fields of Study Notre Dame College provides a wide variety of disciplinary minors. Minors allow students to have a meaningful concentration of courses in areas that may be of value in support of the major. Carefully chosen minors can be an asset in obtaining employment and in facilitating career change.  Requirements for minors generally range from 18-24 credit hours.  Double Major Some students may wish to complete two majors while at Notre Dame College. The student completes all the requirements in effect in the catalog for each major. A double major is only applicable if the two majors apply to the same degree. It is not permissible to pursue a second major that pertains to a different degree. In this situation, it is recommended the student add an applicable minor or second major which falls under the same degree. Only one degree will be granted to any student at the time of graduation.  The student must be aware that it may not be possible to complete two majors in only four years.  Graduation Fee A graduation fee is charged to all undergraduate degree applicants, and is payable prior to graduation. The fee is nonrefundable. This fee covers the cost of degree audits and evaluations, the diploma, diploma cover, and shipping supplies and expenses and the commencement ceremony.  Programs of Study Majors, minors and areas of licensure are listed here. See the indicated discipline’s section of the catalog for specific requirements.  36  A Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree is available with these majors:     Accounting (Business Administration)   Biology  Chemistry   Communication   Education   English  Criminal Justice  Emergency Management and Policy Studies (Public Service & Security Studies)  Environmental Science   Graphic Design (Art)  History (Public Service & Security Studies)   Finance (Business Administration)  Human Resources Development (Business Administration)  Intelligence Studies (Public Service & Security Studies)   International Business (Business Administration)  Management Information Systems (Business Administration)  Management (Business Administration)   Marketing (Business Administration)   Mathematics  Political Science (Public Service & Security Studies)   Psychology  Software Development (Business Administration)  Sport Management (Business Administration)   Studio Art  Interdisciplinary Majors (Bachelor of Arts degree)  Political Science (Public Administration) (Public Service & Security Studies)   Public Relations (Communication/Business)  Not all degrees are available in a fully online format.

Individually Designed Majors (Bachelor of Arts degree) and Minors The Individually Designed Major (IDM) or Minor is multi-disciplinary in nature and is available only to exceptional students (minimum 3.0 GPA) whose interests and career goals are not met by current majors or minors. A student wishing to design an IDM must work with the Office of Academic Affairs to develop a unique curriculum that does not duplicate substantial portions of existing programs. The IDM must be reviewed and approved by two faculty members. With faculty endorsement, the Office of Academic Affairs must grant final approval of the curriculum. Students interested in an IDM should inquire at the Office of Academic Affairs.  Areas of the Individually Designed Major must be available at Notre Dame College.  A Bachelor of Science (BS) degree is available in these majors:  Biology  Chemistry   Mathematics  A Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is available in the Nursing major.   37  Minors are available in these areas:   Accounting (Business Administration)  Art History (Art)  Biology  Chemistry  Coaching (Health/Physical Education)   Communication  Economics  Education: Adolescent/Young Adult (7 - 12)   English  Entrepreneurship (Business Administration)  Financial Services Management (Business Administration)  Fine Arts  Game Design (Art)  Health Education   History  International Business (Business Administration)   Management (Business Administration)  Management Information Systems (Business Administration)  Marketing (Business Administration)   Mathematics  Multimedia (Art, Information Systems)  Music  Performing Arts  Philosophy  Political Science  Psychology  Public Relations (Communication)   Sociology  Software Development  Spanish (Modern Languages)   Theatre  Theology   Women’s Studies   Writing (English)  Licensure Areas  Early Childhood Education (Pre-K - Gr. 3)  Middle Childhood Education (Gr. 4 - 9) Areas of Concentration—choose two from the following: Mathematics, Reading and Language Arts, Science and Social Studies  Adolescent/Young Adult Education (Gr. 7 - 12)  Integrated Language Arts  Integrated Mathematics  Integrated Social Studies   Life Sciences  Life Sciences and Chemistry  Multi-Age Education (K - 12) Mild/Moderate Intervention Specialist  Graduate Programs Graduate programs are offered in Education, Nursing Education, and in Security Policy Studies (Intelligence). For further information, contact The Finn Center for Adult, Graduate and Online Learning at NotreDameCollege.edu/admissions/graduate a copy of the graduate bulletin.  38   Alternative Methods of Learning Assessment Notre Dame College acknowledges the fact that learning acquired outside the traditional classroom setting can be equivalent to college-level learning. Upon careful review, and appropriate documentation, the College may grant academic course credit.  The number of credits earned through alternate methods of learning assessment may not exceed 30 semester hours. Credits earned through this process must be requested before the beginning of the academic year in which the degree is to be granted. Credits granted in this manner will be listed as part of the student’s official academic record only after all appropriate fees have been paid. All credits will be subject to the approval of the division chairperson and the Office of Academic Affairs.  Experiential Learning Credits Those who have acquired academic knowledge or skills through direct experience, in-service training or non- credit classes may have it validated for college credit. Students apply for such credits through a process called portfolio assessment. Portfolio assessment may not be accepted for credit in certain disciplines or for certain courses. A student should contact the appropriate division chairperson for more information prior to preparing the portfolio.  Proficiency Examinations Examinations to demonstrate subject matter competency may be taken for credit or non-credit validation for a small fee. Such examinations may not be used to raise an existing grade. A grade of “C” is the minimum acceptable level for credits earned through examination. A student should contact the appropriate division chairperson for more information. All credits received through the Proficiency Examination will appear as PASS on the transcript.  College Level Examination Program (CLEP) Nationally-normed CLEP examinations are accepted at Notre Dame College to validate knowledge of both general and specific subject areas. CLEP exams may not be taken in areas already successfully completed for course credits. A student should contact the Office of the Registrar for more information on courses accepted through CLEP testing and for minimal scores required for credit by NDC.  Independent Study and Laboratory Research To foster independent learning, Notre Dame College encourages talented students to pursue Independent Study Projects and Laboratory Research Projects.  A student with senior standing and a minimum grade point average of 3.0 both in general studies and in the major field of study may qualify for these options.  For Independent Study, a student works with a faculty member who helps define the project, and develop the learning objectives and the method of presentation for the project. A student who wishes to pursue a laboratory research project follows the same procedure and may choose to work with a faculty member who is carrying out a large research project.  The grade and credits earned for the project may be included in the academic major and general degree requirements for graduation. Such consideration must be addressed prior to enrollment.    39  Other Policies and Procedures  Classification of Students A DEGREE-SEEKING STUDENT is one who follows a planned program of studies at Notre Dame College leading to a degree. Minimum credit requirements for class standing are as follows: Sophomores 28 semester credits Juniors  60 semester credits Seniors  90 semester credits  A FULL-TIME STUDENT is one who carries twelve (12) or more credits per semester. A student with a high scholastic average may, with the permission of the Office of Academic Affairs, carry more than 19 credits during a given semester. Additional charges will apply after 19 credits.  A PART-TIME STUDENT is one who is registered for fewer than twelve (12) semester credits per semester.  AN AUDITOR is a student permitted to attend classes on a non-credit basis. Requirements to be met by auditors are set by individual instructors. See Advising Center staff for registration information.  Academic Dishonesty Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to the following: 1) the completion or attempted completion of any academic work by means other than those permitted; and 2) the alteration of a document relating to the grading process, including changing an instructor’s grade book or changing answers on a test after the time to complete the test is over.  Examples of academic dishonesty include but are not limited to: unauthorized collaboration; copying another student’s answers; unauthorized aids on a test; using purchased or pre-made term papers; plagiarism; and destroying another student’s work.  Plagiarism occurs when an individual presents the ideas, thoughts or words of another as his or her own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited to: using phrases, sentences or ideas from a published source, including the Internet, without citing that source; representing another’s unpublished work as one’s own; rewriting or paraphrasing the work of another without giving credit to that person by citation; and submitting a paper that has been copied, in whole or part, from another’s work as one’s own work.  Generally, the faculty decides upon sanctions for acts of Academic Dishonesty. Thus, Academic Dishonesty may carry specific penalties carried out by the faculty outside of the Judicial Procedure. Those penalties include but are not limited to: failure on the specific assignment, failure of the course, and/or a letter detailing the offense which is kept in the Office of Academic Affairs. Note that although deference is given to the faculty to handle matters of Academic Dishonesty, such action does not preclude further disciplinary action under the College Judicial Procedures.  Students with Disabilities Notre Dame College makes reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. A qualified student with a disability may request support services from the Dwyer Learning Center on a yearly basis. In order to receive services at Notre Dame College, students with disabilities must provide documentation such as a statement from a medical doctor or licensed psychologist which meets state and federal standards for indicating the presence of a disability. (See Student Disability Services.)  40  Transfer Policies for Notre Dame College All potential transfer students to Notre Dame College must submit an application to the College. Applications can be found on the College website: www.NotreDameCollege.edu.  Students applying for undergraduate or graduate programs whether on campus or online, work with the Admissions Office. Official transcripts must be sent directly from the educational institutions to Notre Dame College. If the applicant received a GED, an official copy of the certificate with the testing scores must be sent directly to NDC by the State Department of Education where the GED was earned.  Transfer students to Notre Dame College must submit the NDC application which can be found on the website, an official copy of the high school transcript or GED certificate, official transcripts from all colleges previously attended, form on felony convictions.  An appointment with an admissions counselor is highly recommended. At the appointment the counselor will do an unofficial evaluation of the transcript(s). Upon receipt of all official academic transcripts a formal evaluation of course equivalences and transcripts will be completed and provided to the student. Transfer credits will appear on the student’s Notre Dame College transcript during the student’s first semester of enrollment.  Transfer policies:  Only courses with a grade of “D” or better will be considered for transfer.  Individual courses and credits transfer; grades, quality points, and cumulative grade point average do not transfer.  Courses considered remedial (below the 100 level) will not transfer.  Credit will be given for those courses that are equivalent in content or rigor to core and major courses at NDC. Courses not considered equivalent to a core or major requirement at NDC will transfer in as electives.    Students may not earn credit for the same course twice. A course determined to be equivalent to a Notre Dame course does not need to be taken at NDC. The transfer evaluation will indicate all equivalencies.  Students must earn a minimum of 30 credits at NDC to graduate.  Courses taken at a non-regionally accredited post-secondary institution will be considered for transfer only if the institution is accredited by an agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education and legally authorized to grant specialized associate degrees or higher. Courses with a B will be considered for transfer only after review by the department chair to determine that the content is in conformity to the Notre Dame College Curriculum. A maximum of 15 credits will apply.  Courses older than 10 years will be considered for transfer on an individual basis; some may transfer in only as electives but not count toward core requirements. Computer courses older than five years will not transfer.  Nursing and education students must undergo a major review prior to admission to the major.  Students must complete 50% of their major course work at NDC.  Notre Dame College will transfer credits earned through advanced placement (AP) courses or the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) based on the scores earned. AP test scores of 3, 4, or 5 will be considered for transfer. To determine if credit will be granted, the College uses the scoring guidelines recommended by CLEP. Generally a score of 50 or above is required for credit.  No more than 30 credits earned through AP, CLEP, portfolio assessment, proficiency exams, independent study and research will be counted toward the 120 credits required for a bachelor’s degree at Notre Dame College.  The official evaluation of coursework will determine whether transfer students may enroll in courses with prerequisites.  Notre Dame College will consider credits earned through or recommended by the military, ACE, DANTES and SMART (Sailor/Marine American Council on Education Registry Transcript) on an individual basis.   41  Transfer Policy with an Associate’s Degree  Recognizing the system of preparation afforded by the completion of an Associate of Arts and Associate of Science (AA/AS) degree, and in accordance with the Ohio Articulation and Transfer policy, Notre Dame College will guarantee admission to the college and afford junior standing to all students who have earned an AA/AS degree from an accredited institution, provided their grade point average is at least 2.0 for all previous college-level courses, excluding Nursing.  Notre Dame College’s Nursing Program has separate admission requirements.   Students completing an AA or AS will be considered to have met all lower biennium general education requirements. Transfer students are required to complete upper biennium general education requirements unless they already have courses similar to these which have been approved in the admission process.    Cross-Registration Full-time students can broaden the scope of their educational opportunities through a system of cross- registration. Each term or semester, students in good academic standing may enroll in one undergraduate course at any of the participating colleges and universities in Greater Cleveland. There is no additional tuition charge, but cross registrants are responsible for their own transportation and any laboratory or special course fees required for the host institution’s course.  Grades from courses taken through cross-registration are part of a student’s Notre Dame College transcript. First-year students are not encouraged to cross-register. For further information, students should contact the Office of the Registrar.  Academic Progress Standards  Earning an undergraduate degree from NDC requires a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 both overall and in the courses of the major [note that some majors require higher cumulative GPA achievement].  In order to help students stay on track, academic progress is reviewed after every semester.  The paragraphs below describe the academic status descriptions used at NDC.  Good Standing Cumulative: Above 2.0 Semester GPA: N/A  Students who have maintained a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher or who have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher and have successfully completed any academic progress requirements as noted below are considered to be in good academic standing.  All students enter in good academic standing.   Good Standing - Academic Warning Cumulative: Above 2.0 Semester GPA: Less than 2.0 in a single semester or any two consecutive semesters   The academic warning designation is used to identify students who, although their cumulative GPA is above 2.0, are deemed high risk.  Students are placed on academic warning for one of two reasons. First, a student currently on academic probation who brings their cumulative GPA above 2.0 will be moved to academic warning status; second, earning a GPA of less than 2.0 in any one or two semesters. Maintaining a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher for two successive semesters will return the student to good academic standing.    Limited to 16 credits for upcoming semester  Register with the Student Success Center  If possible, repeat any failed courses  Meet your class attendance obligations 42   Earn a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher and demonstrate that you are making adequate progress toward earning a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0  Use the services of the Dwyer Learning Center to help you achieve a higher level of academic success.  Academic Probation Cumulative: Below 2.0 or 2 Consecutive Semesters on Academic Warning Semester GPA: N/A  A student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 is placed on academic probation. Unless the student gives evidence of scholastic improvement during the semester after being placed on probation, the student may be suspended from Notre Dame College. A student on academic probation who earns a semester GPA at or above 2.0 may be moved from academic probation to academic warning.    Limited to 16 credits for upcoming semester  Register with the Student Success Center  If possible, repeat any failed courses  Meet your class attendance obligations  Earn a semester GPA of 2.0 or higher and demonstrate that you are making adequate progress toward earning a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0    Continue to use the services of the Dwyer Learning Center to help you achieve a higher level of academic success.  Academic Suspension  A student on who does not show evidence of academic progress or any student who does not pass the majority of his/her courses during any one semester is subject to suspension. A student may be dismissed or placed on academic suspension without having been placed on warning or probation the previous semester. A student may be placed on academic suspension if both the semester and cumulative grade point averages are significantly below a 2.0, but not low enough to meet dismissal criteria.  Students who have been suspended from the College for lack of academic progress may appeal the suspension immediately or apply for readmission after one semester. To appeal the suspension, a student must sign the Final Probation Agreement and fax or email the signed agreement to the Office of Academic Affairs before the deadline stated in the Suspension letter and email.  Final Probation after Appeal A student readmitted after appeal of Academic Suspension must achieve the following criteria to be considered for Academic Probation:  Register for no more than 16 credits. If you registered for more credits, you must change your schedule. Contact the Student Success Center or your academic advisor.   Repeat courses in which you earned a grade of F as soon as possible.  Register with the Dwyer Learning Center (DLC) OR the Academic Support Center (ASC) the first week of the semester; follow all requirements set up by the DLC or the ASC.  Attend all class meetings; be on time for each class and stay the entire time.  Establish a calendar listing all assignments including papers, projects, readings, presentations and quizzes and exams. Check the calendar every day to know what is coming up; look beyond one day/week. Turn in papers and projects on time.  Meet with a representative of the Office of Academic Affairs to discuss academic progress.   Prioritize your time.  Earn a minimum term GPA of 2.000 with no Fs or Ws.    43  Academic Dismissal Previously suspended students who have been granted readmission and who continue to make less than satisfactory academic progress will be dismissed from the College for no less than one academic year. Readmission after dismissal is most unusual and only for compelling reasons. A report of scholarship grades is available to all students on the NDC portal.  Status Review A letter requesting an academic status review must be sent to the Office of Academic Affairs before the beginning of the semester in which the student seeks status review. Elements considered in evaluating scholastic improvement include the number of credits attempted and earned, and the semester GPA.    Financial Aid Recipients If a student does not achieve a 2.00 GPA, and if it is judged that the student should be permitted to continue to attend classes, the student may be eligible for certain portions of the financial aid package if the other conditions for financial aid eligibility have been met. The student must demonstrate steady improvement toward the 2.0 GPA.  Definitions of academic progress for the award of financial aid may differ from academic policies. Each student should work closely with the financial aid office to ensure that there is an understanding of those standards and their implications for financial aid eligibility. (See Financial Aid for more information)  Academic Standards and Grades Letter grades are used to indicate academic achievement in accord with the standards of scholarship maintained at Notre Dame College. The interpretation of each grade and its corresponding point values are specified below:  NUMERICAL    EQUIVALENT  QUALITY POINTS A     93-100%  4.0 per credit hour A-    90-92%   3.7 per credit hour B+     87-89%   3.3 per credit hour B     83-86%   3.0 per credit hour B-      80-82%   2.7 per credit hour C+      77-79%   2.3 per credit hour C       73-76%   2.0 per credit hour C-       70-72%   1.7 per credit hour D       65-69%   1.0 per credit hour F     0-64%   0.0 per credit hour  If a student earns an “F” as a final grade in a required course, the course must be repeated. If a student repeats a course in which an “F” or “D” grade was received, and in so doing earns a higher grade, that higher grade will replace the former in computing the GPA. A course may be counted only once toward graduation requirements. No course may be repeated more than once unless permission is obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs.  CR/NC (Pass/Fail) are grades which may be earned in specific instances. CR (Pass) means that a student has achieved a grade of “C” or higher in a course; however, the grade is not computed into the student’s grade point average. NC (Fail) means that a student has not earned academic credit. Ordinarily, a maximum of one course per semester may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis.  Change of registration from CR/NC to a letter grade or vice versa must be carried out through the Office of the Registrar during the first week of the semester.  44  Departments may declare which of their course offerings may be open for the Pass/Fail option, as well as the number of students who may be admitted on a Pass/Fail basis. The designation of “Incomplete” is not a grade. It denotes a limited period of time allotted for a student to complete a course after the end of the term because of extenuating circumstances. An Incomplete is granted only upon the student’s request and with permission of the instructor.  If the “I” is not removed within six weeks after the last day of examinations for semester courses, the letter ”I” will be converted to an “F.” The deadline to convert I’s to letter grades for online courses is four weeks after the end of the session.  Change of Grade Grades received in courses are not changed except for special circumstances in which teacher error is apparent. Grade change requests based on simple reevaluation of the instructor’s original judgment are not permitted.  Grade changes must be initiated within 45 days after the close of the term in which the grade was earned, with the exception of the spring term. Changes in the spring term must be initiated within 45 days after the fall term has begun. No grade changes may be made without the approval of the Office of Academic Affairs.  Academic Grade Appeal Processes Various protections are offered to students at the College to assure a fair and consistent treatment in academic matters. A student who wishes to contest a course grade must initiate the appeal process in writing no later than two weeks after the date the grade was issued. The form can be obtained in the Office of Academic Affairs.  The two items of an academic nature that follow have specific procedures to address concerns:  Demonstrably arbitrary and unfair evaluation of student produced course work.  Accusations of plagiarism or other forms of academic dishonesty.  The processes for each of these follow.  Demonstrably Arbitrary and Unfair Evaluation of Student-Produced Course Work Students have a right to expect fair and consistent issuance of course grades. The grading policy employed in each class, including the comparative weight of each component used to determine the final grade, is outlined in each course syllabus. It is the student’s responsibility to read and understand the grading policy outlined in that syllabus.  Students who have questions about grades on projects, tests or final grades for the semester are encouraged to meet with the faculty member to review the grades. In the case of a final grade only, if the student still does not understand the basis for the grade or believes that the composition of the semester grade conflicts with the grading policy stated in the syllabus, the student may request an additional meeting with the instructor and the appropriate department/division chairperson.   (If the appropriate department/division chairperson is the instructor in question, the concern should be directed to the Office of Academic Affairs.) This meeting must be requested within two weeks of receipt of the final grade, and must take place no later than 30 days after the beginning of the next semester.  At this meeting, the student will be asked to provide evidence to substantiate the claim that the grade was either arbitrary or unfair. The role of the appropriate department/division chairperson is to facilitate communication and clarify understandings. At the faculty member’s sole prerogative, the final grade may be modified or the assigned grade may be sustained.  No grade may be lowered as a result of these meetings. If the dispute is resolved, this meeting is the final step of the review process.  45  If the dispute is not resolved, one last step may be utilized. The student may appeal the dispute to the   Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs within one week of the initial meeting. The Vice President will consult with the appropriate department/division chairperson and will establish an appeal committee of three faculty members, one of whom may be recommended by the student bringing the appeal. A committee chairperson will be appointed by the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. The committee chairperson will notify the faculty member of the appeal and the composition of the committee.  The appeal committee will hear the student’s complaint, interview the faculty member and study the information provided by both parties. If necessary, the committee may interview other students or faculty members in its efforts to determine the facts.  The committee will make a report to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs in which it reviews the issues and recommends a solution. This report is to be made within thirty days of when the appeal was made to the VPASA. In most cases this will be a recommendation to uphold the grade awarded by the instructor or to alter the grade which the student received. In some cases the recommendation may be to present the student with other alternatives such as the completion of additional work before a final grade is determined.  The Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs after consultation with the President will inform the faculty member and the student of the recommendations of the appeal committee and will take the steps necessary to implement the recommendations.  The grade appeal process is not designed to address accusations of discrimination or harassment. If such concerns are the premise upon which the appeal is made, the student is directed to use the processes established by the College to resolve discrimination or harassment charges.  Accusations of Plagiarism or Other Forms of Academic Dishonesty Plagiarism is offering work of another as one’s own. Plagiarism is a serious offense and may include, but is not limited to, the following:  Complete or partial copying directly from a written publication or unpublished source in any form of media without proper acknowledgment to the author. Making minor changes in wording or syntax—without acknowledgment to the author— is not sufficient to avoid plagiarism charges.  Paraphrasing the work of another without proper author acknowledgment.  Submitting as one’s own original work (however freely given or purchased), the original exam, research paper, manuscript, report, computer file, Internet information or other assignment that has been prepared by another individual.  The usual penalty for academic dishonesty is failure on the assignment for the first offense. All incidents of plagiarism are reported to the Office of Academic Affairs, and a letter citing the incident is included in the student’s official file. Should a second incident of plagiarism occur during the student’s pursuit of a degree, he/she will earn an “F” in that course, and a letter regarding the incident will be entered into the student’s official file. Upon graduation, all relevant letters in the student’s file will be destroyed. Should a third incident of plagiarism occur, the student will be dismissed from the College; her/his readmission is unlikely.  In all cases of alleged academic dishonesty (such as plagiarism, cheating, claiming work not done by the student or lying) where a faculty member observes or discovers the dishonesty, the faculty member may choose to confront the student and handle the matter between the faculty member and the student, or the faculty member may choose to refer the incident to the appropriate department/division chairperson. If the appropriate department/division chairperson is the instructor in question, the concern should be directed to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. If the faculty member chooses to confront the situation alone with the student and the matter is satisfactorily resolved, the faculty member and the student should submit a joint statement of the 46  details to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs, which will be included in the student’s file. If the situation is not satisfactorily resolved between the faculty member and the student, the matter may then be referred or appealed to the appropriate department/division chairperson.  In either case, the appropriate department/division chairperson may choose to 1) resolve the matter through a meeting with both the student and the faculty member, or 2) refer the matter to the Vice President for Academic and Student Affairs. The findings, in either case, are final.  If alleged academic dishonesty is reported to a faculty member by a third party, then the faculty member will meet with the appropriate department/division chairperson to determine whether the evidence warrants an investigation, and how the investigation will be handled. It may also be decided that the faculty member will either confront the student or, assuming enough evidence is present to warrant action, turn the matter over to the appropriate department/division chairperson to either resolve or organize a hearing.  Please note: A more formalized step-by-step version of the Grade Appeal Policy is being developed and will take effect as soon as it is finalized.  Class Attendance Regular attendance in classes is expected of all students; however, some College sponsored co- curricular and extra-curricular events may occasionally be scheduled during class hours. It is College policy that students who are participants in a College sponsored event are excused from a class for the specific event. (Exceptions to this policy: students fulfilling nursing clinicals and student teaching requirements.)  All students in all ON CAMPUS courses must attend the first class meeting of each course on their schedule. It is imperative that students attend classes and it is known they are present in class. Instructors will take attendance and report absences to the Office of Academic Affairs by the end of the first Friday of the semester. Any student whose name is marked “non-attend/absent” will be removed from the class list, freeing seats for other students during the “ADD” period. The ADD period for ON CAMPUS courses will be extended to Wednesday September 5, 2018 at 12:00 noon.   We recognize that students may have a legitimate reason for not being in class. In such a case, you must contact the professor via email BEFORE THE START OF THE CLASS ON THE FIRST DAY and provide documentation upon your arrival in class.    Note: 1. Students are expected to attend each and every class meeting in its entirety. Faculty members shall maintain a record of classroom attendance throughout the semester. 2. Class absences are excused for medical reasons documented by medical personnel, and school-sponsored activities. Other situations to be recognized as excused absences include but are not limited to: athletic events, academic competitions in which the student is a participant, military duties, and death in immediate family, medical emergencies, auto accidents, etc. Verification of such absences will be required by the instructor and the student is responsible for the make-up work as required by the instructor. Make-up work is granted without penalty when the absence is excused and the work is completed with the time frame determined by the professor, however the student must initiate the request to make up work.  Participants in College sponsored co-curricular and extra-curricular events:  Are not excused for practice.  Are expected to make-up all work they miss. 47   Are not penalized by the instructor for their excused absence.  Are expected to communicate with each faculty member before the date of the excused absence.  Must meet individual faculty requirements to complete work due for each missed class.  College personnel who are responsible for the College sponsored co-curricular and extra-curricular events will inform faculty of the game/event schedules at the beginning of each semester. When weather is a factor in College sponsored events and games, an event or game may be cancelled and require rescheduling. It is the student’s responsibility to inform the faculty of any change in the original schedule.  Student-athletes are subject to the additional rules and procedures of the NCAA, Notre Dame College’s Department of Athletics and their individual coaches.  Withdrawal from Courses Sometimes students may need to withdraw from Notre Dame College or from one or more courses. However, a student may drop a course and add another only during the “drop/add” period (typically the first week of classes.) A student may drop a full semester course after the first week of classes and up until the 10th week of classes with the designation of “W” with permission of the academic advisor, the Advising Center or the Office of Academic Affairs. Short term courses have different withdrawal deadline dates and refund policies. Withdrawals could result in tuition charges and/or loss of financial aid and loss of athletic eligibility.  Different guidelines exist for students in the on-line program and in shortened sessions; please consult those applicable policies for more information.  To be official all withdrawals must be in writing and submitted to the Registrar’s Office for processing. The date the Registrar’s Office receives the written notification determines any refund.  Withdrawal from the College Students who wish to withdraw from Notre Dame College must meet with the Director of the Student Success Center to initiate the withdrawal process.  Any student who drops below full-time status may face eligibility issues for participation in intercollegiate athletics, living in the residence halls or participating in the Academic Support Center for Students with Learning Differences, as well as participation in anything that requires full time student status.  Students who withdraw from the College are subject to the refund policy established in the “refund” section of this catalogue and all other applicable financial policies. Students who voluntarily withdraw must follow the admission and re-admission standards in place at the time of re-enrollment. If a student withdraws from the College or is not enrolled for one academic year, he/she must follow catalog requirements and academic policies in effect at the time of the readmission or new registration.  Non-attendance and/or non-payment DO NOT constitute official withdrawal. If a student fails to withdraw officially, he/she will be responsible for all tuition and fee charges.  Honors and Awards Graduation with Honors. To be eligible for graduation with honors, “cum laude,” a student must earn a grade point average of 3.50; for graduation “magna cum laude,” he/she must earn an average of 3.75; for “summa cum laude,” he/she must earn an average of 3.90. Furthermore, the student must have earned at least 120 semester credits, including 60 from Notre Dame College.  48  Honors Scholars Program. Students in the Honors Scholars Program will receive the designation of Honors Scholar on the final transcript if 21 credits of honors courses have been successfully completed and the cumulative GPA is 3.5 or better.  Dean’s List. In recognition of academic excellence, a Dean’s List is compiled each academic semester. To qualify, a student must have an average of 3.50 or greater and must have completed 12 or more hours of graded course work by the end of that semester. An incomplete grade (I) precludes such recognition.  President’s List. In recognition of a superior level of academic achievement, a President’s List is compiled each academic semester. To qualify, a student must have an average of 4.00 and must have completed 15 or more hours of graded course work by the end of that semester. An incomplete grade (I) precludes such recognition.

In 1987, the Outstanding Teaching Award was instituted to recognize the excellent teaching done by part-time faculty who are a regular part of the teaching staff each year. Based on nominations from students, alumni and faculty, the criteria for selection include excellence in teaching, service, availability to students and a commitment to the mission of the College.  The Finn Center Online Programs Notre Dame College offers a variety of courses and, in some cases, entire degree programs in an online format. Online courses use the Learning Management System, Moodle, to deliver most, and often all, of the course to the student, increasing flexibility and removing geographic and time barriers that sometimes make it difficult for students to complete courses or programs. In fact, a recent study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education concluded “…on average, students in online learning conditions performed better than those receiving face-to-face instruction.” Understanding that the delivery of education can greatly enhance the quality of learning at Notre Dame College (NDC), the college is expanding the opportunities for students to participate in online learning experiences.  Online Academic Terms Online courses at NDC are offered in eight week accelerated terms designated “D” terms. There are six “D” terms in an academic year. Within the fall semester, online courses are offered in terms D-1 and D-2 where D-1 courses run the first part of the semester and D-2 courses begin midway through the semester and run for the second half of the fall semester. Similarly, within the spring semester the D-3 term runs during the first half of the semester and D-4 begins midway through the spring semester and runs during the second half of the semester. Term D-5 and D-6 are summer online terms. Full semester online courses are denoted as AD or BD in the course section.     For students taking online courses along with traditional semester courses, it is important to bear in mind that if a D-2 or D-4 course is scheduled, the first part of the semester will seem relatively light since the online course will not begin until midway through the semester. Several weeks prior to the start of a D-2 or D- 4 course, students will receive email reminding them of the upcoming course. Students should be prepared for the increased workload the online course will create during the remainder of that regular semester. To increase the probability of academic success, students are not permitted entry into accelerated online courses after the term has begun.  Student Verification and Attendance in Online Courses Regular attendance and participation are important contributors to student success in online courses. To comply with federal mandates for the college’s management of financial aid, certain kinds of student activity may or may not count as participation sufficient to qualify as “attendance” in online courses. For a copy of the latest version of these federal mandates, please see the Federal Student Aid Handbook.  51   For verification of enrollment in online courses, students must log in during week 1 of each 8-week “D” term. All students who have not logged in to their class by the end of the 1st week of each 8-week “D” term will be automatically dropped from their course (effective on the last day of 100% refund) and billed a $150 cancellation fee.   Any student enrolled in an online course at Notre Dame College must complete one of the following academically-related activities within their online course in order to be marked as having attended and actively participated in the online course(s):   1. Post to a discussion board  2. Submit an assignment  3. Submit a quiz or exam  4. Submit some other assessment as assigned.   This means that simply logging into a course and navigating within the virtual classroom will not constitute participation; the student must complete one of the above academically-related activities.    All students who logged in to their course, but who have not participated academically by the end of the 2nd week of the “D” term will be automatically dropped from their course (effective on the last day of 100% refund) and billed a $150 cancellation fee.  Please note that there are a significant number of other academically-related activities required when taking online courses, such as reading discussion boards, reading course materials and lectures, and messaging instructors, but these activities are not considered as student participation.     What is an Online Course Like at NDC? Online courses at Notre Dame College are accelerated and intensive, covering in eight weeks the same material the course normally covers during a 15 week semester. Most students find online courses more challenging than regular classroom courses because of the accelerated nature of the online course. The same objectives and academic content are taught in the online course, but the time in which one completes the workload is accelerated.  Most online courses are designed and scheduled as eight (8) week term courses. A student can expect to engage in the course, online, a minimum of 1 ½ hours per credit hour that a course earns, per week. The average student should plan on spending a minimum of 8-10 hours per week of work (inside and outside of an online course) for a three credit course (not inclusive of field or lab work).  Student Engagement: Online courses must engage students in as much contact time as equivalent face-to- face courses. An eight week online course must engage students for a minimum of 4.5 hours per week in Moodle, in addition to reading textbook material and crafting assignments for submission.  What counts toward course engagement?  Time reading lesson lectures in the course outline.  Time spent participating in surveys, quizzes and exams that are contained in the course  Time spent posting in forums  Time spent in synchronous activities such as live classrooms or chats  Group work that normally would be conducted in-class   52  What does not count toward course engagement but is required activity of courses?  Reading required materials (textbooks, articles, etc.)  Composing written assignments  Work on projects  Group work that normally would be required outside of face-to-face class  Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Online courses that have activities requiring students to be logged into a course at a specific day and time are referred to as synchronous. Most commonly, the synchronous activity in NDC courses is a virtual classroom that allows real-time voice, text, and in some cases, video chat between instructors and students. Most online courses in the Division of Education contain synchronous activities and students should plan their schedules accordingly. In the course schedule booklets, courses with synchronous activities will list the days of the week and times students are expected to log into the online course.  Asynchronous courses are online courses where students do not have to log into the course at a specific time. Students still engage with the instructor and other students on a regular basis using activities such as forums (online threaded discussions) where, based on material in the lessons, students post an initial response to a question and then interact with the instructor and other classmates to develop their knowledge and ask questions. In course schedule booklets, asynchronous courses will list “NA” in columns for days and times.  Synchronous Classroom A secondary external system that students may be using is one referred to as either the Live Classroom or Meeting Room. This is where students will go when the course is meeting in real time for class discussions, etc. All meeting rooms are linked within the course, and the instructor will provide additional information regarding the live meeting.  All Education program courses (ED) have a scheduled, live meeting each week during the online term. Students are expected to login, attend and actively participate in all scheduled meetings. NOTE: Students will need to speak and hear the live instruction. Some computers have built in microphone function and some students choose to use a headset with a microphone. It is imperative that students are able to speak live in their course and hear the instructor. Use of a microphone is mandatory in synchronous online courses. Technical Support for Online courses There is a 24/7 help desk available for fully online courses. The technical support line for Online Moodle is 800-985-9781. Students can access all of the training without a login ID. At the left-hand side of the screen there is a hyperlink “Launch Help Center.” When the link is clicked, a new screen will open. There are several links on this page. Go through each; they don’t take long. Recommendation: begin with the link labeled “Browser Settings”; this helps set up the computer.  How do I know if I can succeed in an online course?  Succeeding in accelerated online courses is much different from succeeding in traditional classroom courses. A different set of skills and habits is required for students to be successful in any accelerated course, especially those that are taken online. Research conducted over the years has demonstrated that students who can identify with most of the characteristics listed below are likely to be successful in accelerated online courses:  They are self-starters who do not procrastinate  They are good at meeting deadlines  They are motivated to read, write and participate in class activities  They have the ability to work independently and in teams  They are resourceful in solving routine technological problems  They are strong in reading, writing and English language grammar skills  They schedule specific time each week to participate in online courses 53   They don’t delay in asking questions when they don’t understand something  They have reliable and consistent access to the internet  They are proficient in basic computer and email skills  They are disciplined in managing their time and daily schedule  What do I need to participate in an online course?  Taking online courses at NDC is rewarding and fulfilling; however, to succeed students must be highly organized and disciplined.  Online faculty and the Finn Center monitor student engagement and participation in online courses. Students who do not log in their courses at the beginning of a term, may be administratively withdrawn.  Minimally students need the following:  A desktop or laptop computer purchased in the last few years  A recent version of Microsoft Office products including Word, PowerPoint and Excel  An internet browser (Highly Recommended: Google Chrome)  A recent version of Adobe Acrobat Reader (available free online)  A media player such as Quick Time or Windows Media Player  Reliable high speed (cable or DSL) internet access  A backup plan in the event the computer crashes  How do I register for an online course?   Depending on a student’s status, the approval process required to register for an online course differs slightly.  Traditional Students in Good Standing.  Traditional students with a good academic standing at NDC are permitted to register for one online course each online term. To enroll in an online course, traditional students must complete the Online Registration Request Form located on My NDC in the Registrar Forms area under the Academics Tab. The Office of the Registrar will enroll students in the online courses and communicate if there are any issues. There is an additional fee for online courses.  Traditional students wanting to take an online course from the Division of Education must also have approval from the Chair of the Division of Education.  All Other Students. Students not classified as traditional (i.e. TEEL®, Adult, Graduate, etc.) do not need approval from the Finn Center to register for online courses. It is strongly recommended that anyone new to online courses at NDC complete the training module entitled, “Is Online Learning for Me?” located at moodle.ndc.edu prior to registering for an online course.  After registering for an online course, students will receive a welcome letter prior to the start of the course. The welcome letter will contain detailed information about accessing and logging into the course(s) for which the student has registered. Students will also likely receive email from the course instructor with introductions and other information regarding the course. All information is sent to students using NDC email accounts. Students will NOT receive email from NDC at alternate email accounts.  Online Course Access You will be able to access your online course(s) through MyNDC using your NDC issued network login. If you do not know how to login to MyNDC, please be sure to contact the 24/7 Help Desk at 800-985-9781 as the Online Educational Services office is not able to assist with this process.  Once logged into MyNDC, you will need to view your schedule to access the course. If you are viewing your schedule prior to the official start date, you will need to view “Future Courses”. Once the term is launched, you 54  can view “Current Courses”. A listing of all registered courses will appear and the course number will be hyperlinked. Use this link to access the course content.  Virtual Bookstore Required textbooks for all semester and online courses can be purchased through the Notre Dame College Bookstore at NDC Virtual Bookstore. Students are expected to have the required materials PRIOR to the first day of all online courses.   Enjoy your Online Course! Online courses are a great alternative for many traditional and non-traditional students. Whether you are a working adult trying to juggle many life demands or a traditional student who needs flexibility for part of a term, online courses can provide the same quality educational experience in an accelerated and proven format. A great deal of technical and advising support is available to students taking online courses. Within each course is a link to a help center that provides immediate 24/7/365 access to assistance via phone, live chat or email. Online instructors are also experienced with most aspects of the course and can help students with many basic questions. The Finn Center is also available to assist students with any questions or concerns regarding online education at NDC.

After direct admission, students in the nursing major are expected to abide by the same progression policy as other nursing majors in order to retain their status in the nursing program. The following are the criteria for direct admission to the BSN Program at Notre Dame College:  Completion of a College Preparatory Curriculum in high school;  o 4 units of English, 3 (4) units of Science (including chemistry, 3 (4) units of Mathematics, 3 units of Social Studies, 2 (4) World Language,1 unit Physical Education, remaining units representative of visual arts, communication, technology or performing arts.    Minimum cumulative high school GPA of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale (i.e. unweighted GPA)  Composite ACT score of 22 or higher (or equivalent SAT scores)  Completed, with a grade of C or higher, the following high school courses: chemistry,  and mathematics  Once directly admitted into the BSN Program, students in the nursing major must successfully complete, with grades of C or higher, all prerequisite and support courses required of pre-nursing students. Direct Admit BSN students must maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.75 or higher during their freshman year at NDC. If those criteria are met, Direct Admit BSN students will progress to the first year (sophomore level) of the BSN program. Conditional acceptance for students in the Pre-Licensure track may be given for those students who are currently enrolled in nursing program prerequisites at the time of application. All nursing course prerequisites must be completed with a grade of C or better and all other requirements must be met for full acceptance into the program. Students in the Pre-Licensure Track will be notified of final acceptance into the program once grades are received for spring semester and the cumulative GPA is determined.   169  Physical and emotional capabilities required for applicants to the Nursing Program include (but are not limited to):  Visual acuity with or without corrective lenses to read small print on medication labels and/or physician’s orders, calibrate equipment, perform physical assessment and recognize when a patient is in imminent danger.  Hearing ability with or without auditory aids to understand the normal speaking voice without seeing the person’s face, hear emergency alarms, student/patient’s calls for help, call bells and stethoscope sounds originating from body systems.  Physical ability to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pulling, pushing, stooping and kneeling.  Ability to communicate effectively in verbal and written form.  Manual dexterity and fine motor skills, including the ability to draw up medication in a syringe.  Emotional stability to function in stressful situations and to accept personal responsibility and accountability for his/her actions.  Pre-licensure students must have a completed criminal record and background check prior to beginning any clinical experience.

The results of the criminal background check may impact the student’s ability to complete the clinical component of the program. Clinical affiliating agencies may refuse access to clinical sites for students with a criminal record.  The results of the background check are used, along with other components of the student’s academic and personal record, to determine the ability of the person to fulfill the requirements of the program. In accordance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 Notre Dame College will make reasonable accommodations to assist a student with a disability to advance through the program.  Re-Enrollment Policy A student in the Pre-Licensure Track of the baccalaureate program who fails a nursing course or withdraws from the nursing sequence for a semester for any reason, including verified illness, personal crisis, or military service, must make a request to the Admission and Retention Committee for re-enrollment.  The written request must include a completed Nursing Division Re-enrollment form (available online or in the Nursing Division office) and an Action Plan developed in collaboration with the student’s advisor.  Students who fail or withdraw from a nursing course may not take nursing electives without applying and being accepted for re-enrollment. Re-enrollment in nursing courses is based upon a space available basis and cannot be guaranteed.  The re-enrolled student must meet current College and nursing program curriculum and graduation requirements at the time of re-enrollment to the program, regardless of the number of credits earned under a previous catalog.  Students who have two unacceptable grades in any combination of nursing courses, including nursing electives, are dismissed from the program and not eligible for re-enrollment.    Readmission Following Absence of One Year or More Policy If a student has not been enrolled in classes at Notre Dame College for one calendar year, the student must apply for readmission to the college and to the nursing program.  Students seeking readmission are expected to follow the same admission process as those prospective students who will be attending Notre Dame College for the first time. The student must meet current College and nursing program curriculum and graduation requirements in place at the time of readmission to the program, regardless of the number of credits earned under a previous catalog.     170  Grading:  A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 is required for all students in the baccalaureate nursing program.  A minimum grade of “C” is required in all nursing prerequisites, support courses and nursing courses in the nursing major. Students must achieve a minimum exam average of 75% in each nursing course and complete all course requirements as specified in the course and clinical syllabus, in order to satisfactorily pass the nursing course with a grade of C or greater.  ATI exams are included as part of the exam average. If a student achieves less than a 75% exam average in a nursing course, the student must repeat the theory, lab, and clinical component (if included) of the nursing course. The nursing program grading scale for exams differs from the College grading scale. See the Nursing Student Handbook for additional information. If a nursing course has a clinical/lab component, students must achieve a satisfactory rating in the clinical/lab component, as well as meet all other course requirements, in order to successfully pass the course.  Students who receive an unsatisfactory clinical/lab rating, but maintain an overall average of 70% or greater for ALL course assignments (including tests and quizzes) will receive a grade of C-. Prerequisite courses and support courses may be repeated only once if a grade lower than C is achieved. Two unacceptable grades in any combination of nursing courses (NR) including Nursing Elective courses will be grounds for dismissal from the nursing program.  Progression: Students must attain a final semester grade of C or better in all nursing prerequisites, support courses, and required nursing courses; must have a 2.5 cumulative GPA; and must achieve a satisfactory clinical/lab rating for their clinical/lab experience to progress in the program. See the Nursing Student Handbook for additional information about progression related to course grading policies. Nursing program students may only withdraw from the same nursing course (NR) one time due to a failing grade, that is, a course grade average lower than 75 % and/or unsatisfactory clinical performance. The withdrawal policy applies if the student withdraws from a course due to the 75% exam average policy. See the Nursing Student Handbook for additional information about progression related to course grading policies. Students will be placed on academic probation in the nursing program, by the Nursing Division, if the cumulative GPA is lower than 2.5 at the end of any semester in the program. If the student does not show progress or raise the GPA to 2.5 or above by the following semester, the student will be dismissed from the program.

Students may pursue programs leading to Ohio licensure in early childhood, middle childhood, special education, and adolescent/young adult. Those pursuing adolescent/young adult also pursue an academic major. The detailed organization of the teacher education program and its specific directives are outlined in the Teacher Candidate Handbook.  Education Unit Vision The Division of Professional Education educates teacher candidates for personal, professional, and global responsibility so that in their role as teachers they are willing to take a stand for human rights and social justice. The willingness to take a stand is critical in local communities and in a world where the disparities in access to goods and resources can threaten human relationships. This aligns with the conceptual framework for the Division of Professional Education at Notre Dame College which is driven by the institutional mission statement of educating “a diverse population...for personal, professional and global responsibility” and the College motto, "Changing the world, one student at a time." Current theory and research, state and national standards, the standards of specialized professional associations, and the concerns of the division’s P-12 partners have further aided the division in reshaping and redefining its conceptual framework of “changing the classroom, one teacher at a time.”  The major themes articulated by the conceptual framework guide candidate performance outcomes and the system by which the division, its programs, and its candidates are assessed.  While the Notre Dame College community embraces and lives out of a carefully articulated and well documented values list (Notre Dame College, 2007), four values stand out in the Notre Dame Education tradition for the Division of Professional Education. The dignity of the whole person and that individual’s right to an education are fundamental to the Notre Dame College teacher preparation program. The Division values the range of diversity among our teacher candidates, in our partnership schools, and among the core and adjunct faculty. Collaboration is highly valued in the Division as we recognize the social nature of learning and work, and we acknowledge the importance of student voice in the education process. Fairness, honesty, respect, and ethical behavior are aspects of responsible professional engagement that the Education Faculty seeks to model for and cultivate in the teacher candidates.  Admission to the Division of Professional Education Education Program admission is open to students who demonstrate that they have the intellectual ability, emotional stability, and dispositional and professional skills needed to be a professional teacher. Students desiring to apply to the Education Program must first be admitted to the College through the regular Admissions Office application process. Students planning to major in Education will be classified as pre-education until their formal acceptance into the Education program. Formal application should be submitted to the Division during "
ED 205,".  Prerequisites needed for admission to the Division of Professional Education are: /206 Psychology of Special Needs/Field Experience PY  201  General Psychology  The pre-education courses must be taken in sequence. 118   Candidates may be required to undergo an Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) background check before being allowed to participate in field experiences in /206 course.  At that time, candidates will receive a letter along with their admission status indicating whether or not they have been admitted with or without writing conditions.  Candidates will have one year to demonstrate progress in writing if they are admitted with conditions.  A third writing sample will be required, and if candidates are still struggling, they may be required to write a plan of professional development in writing and show evidence of following through with the plan before they are allowed to student teach.  Requirements for Continuing in the Program: To be retained after formal admission to the program, teacher candidates are required to:  119   Earn a B- average or better in education core classes.   Earn no more than 1 C-, C, or C+ in any education course; if a second C is earned, the candidate must retake one of the courses.  Give evidence of continuing growth in the knowledge, skills and dispositions of the program;  Maintain the 2.75 GPA and other qualifications required for admission to the program; and  Maintain work in TK 20.  Comply with College-wide Academic Policies and Procedures.  Education Unit Outcomes: The Division of Professional Education at Notre Dame College believes that teacher candidates must possess deep and rich content and pedagogical knowledge in order to successfully create, present, and evaluate meaningful learning experiences for students in grades P-12. The teacher candidates must possess the skills and dispositions necessary to engage P-12 students of diverse backgrounds and various learning needs in challenging yet attainable learning goals. This kind of professional work can only be successfully accomplished with the help of the P-12 parents/caregivers and the collaboration of all members of the school community.  Through its undergraduate licensure programs, the Notre Dame College teacher candidates follow a program of study that develops their ability to meet the expectations of the Ohio Standards for the Teaching Profession. The teacher candidates will:  Give evidence of understanding student learning and development and the ability to create learning experiences that correspond to P-12 students’ cultural, linguistic, and developmental differences.  Give evidence of depth and breadth in their content knowledge and the content specific instructional strategies to effectively facilitate learning in grades P-12.  Plan and deliver effective instruction that advances the learning of each student.  Understand, create, use, and evaluate varied formal and informal assessments to inform instruction and ensure student learning.  Create physically and emotionally safe learning environments that promote high levels of achievement for all students.  Effectively collaborate and communicate with students, parents, other educators, and administrators to support and further student learning.  Give evidence of assuming responsibility for ongoing professional dispositions, behaviors, and   ethics that are marks of professional conduct.  Create reflection papers that indicate the ability to articulate their teaching/presentation strengths and weaknesses following a teaching segment.  Apply knowledge of key educational theorists to teaching and learning contexts.  Student Teaching: Teacher candidates may only register for the 15-week student teaching experience in the  Fall or Spring semesters. All teacher candidates must have a completed criminal record and background check prior to beginning student teaching. Teacher candidates must assume all costs associated with the background checks/fingerprinting. The results of the criminal background check may impact the candidate’s ability to complete the clinical component of the program.  Teacher candidates must have completed all required coursework prior to student teaching. The 15-week student teaching experience is considered a full time, 40-hour per week position. Student teachers must attend the required seminar and successfully complete a performance assessment designed to measure their effectiveness in the classroom.   120  Students who are seeking a bachelor’s degree will take twelve (12) credits of student teaching. Students who participate in the May graduation and who plan to complete student teaching the following fall will take twelve (12) credits of student teaching. The degree earned and the diploma will be presented upon the successful completion of student teaching.  If the student teacher independently and voluntarily chooses to terminate the student teaching placement and removes himself/herself from the student teaching classroom, the candidate will not receive an additional placement during the same semester or any subsequent semesters through Notre Dame College. If a student teacher is removed from a placement due to the request of the cooperating teacher or the school, the Division of Professional Education in consultation with the Office of Academic Affairs will determine whether an additional placement is warranted.

The coursework in these areas provides students with the tools to develop communicative and intercultural competency and proficiency, so that they can interact, engage, and compete in the global community.  Arabic courses are open to all students, and the study of this language has applications for those students majoring in intelligence studies. The intelligence and law enforcement communities are seeking candidates for employment who have some proficiency in Arabic in order to effectively counter potential international terrorist threats.  Accordingly, some level of Arabic proficiency can be useful for candidates seeking employment with the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Homeland Security, and other federal, state and local agencies.  Students majoring in international business may also find Arabic study useful.    Student Learning Outcomes Upon completing 12 credits of Arabic, students will be able to:   Demonstrate sufficient comprehension to understand most factual material in nontechnical prose   Possess an active reading vocabulary  Initiate and maintain predictable face-to-face conversations and satisfy limited social demands such as travel and accommodation needs   Demonstrate understandable pronunciation  Demonstrate ability to write routine social correspondence   Produce writing that is legible to native readers  Comprehend short conversations in common social and emergency situations  SPANISH In keeping with the mission of Notre Dame College, the Spanish program offers students a minor that enables them to think critically, read analytically, and write clearly in the Spanish language while also learning about literature and culture.

The mission of the Notre Dame College Nursing Program is to prepare a professional nurse who is responsive to the health needs of a diverse global society.   This mission is implemented through fostering personal, professional, and social responsibility within the context of a values-based faith environment. Liberal arts and the sciences serve as the foundation for the professional education and the development of core competencies. The baccalaureate nursing program provides unique opportunities for service to meet the health needs of society, especially the vulnerable and underserved.  International educational opportunities are also integrated throughout the program to prepare students for practice in a rapidly changing global health care environment. The baccalaureate nursing program prepares individuals for practice in a variety of health care settings and serves as a foundation for further graduate education. Upon successful completion of the licensure examination, the graduate is licensed by the state in which they test.   Tracks: Multiple entry levels for the program are designed to meet the needs of the life-long learner. The Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) accredited Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program has two tracks. The Pre-Licensure Track is designed to prepare the student to become a professional nurse. Upon completion of the program the graduate is eligible to take the National Council Licensing Exam (NCLEX-RN®) to become a registered nurse.   The second track is the Post-Licensure RN to BSN Track. This track is designed for the registered nurse (RN) who has a diploma in nursing or an Associate of Science degree with a major in nursing and who wants to complete a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree.    Program Outcomes: Graduates of the BSN Program will be able to:  Synthesize concepts and theories from the liberal arts, sciences, and the discipline of nursing to promote the health and well-being of individuals, groups, communities, and populations.  Communicate effectively using oral, written and other forms of information technology.  Demonstrate competence in technological skills used in professional nursing practice.  Apply critical thinking to evaluate alternatives and make decisions that affect the health and well-being of self and others.  Integrate personal and professional values to practice within the legal and ethical standards of the profession.  Respect human diversity in the provision of health care to populations of different gender, socioeconomic, religious, or cultural traditions.  Demonstrate leadership and management in the delivery of health care within complex adaptive systems.  Support a commitment to life-long learning for personal and professional development.  Use evidence-based practice in the provision of health care services for individuals, groups, communities, and populations in a variety of settings.  Participate in political processes that influence the economic, legal and social direction of health care policies.  Transfer and Advanced Standing:    Transfer students must submit a nursing application to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program and must meet all prerequisites for entry into the Program.   Students transferring into the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program must abide by the College policies regarding transfer students and the evaluation of credits toward the degree. Not all  167  qualified transfer students may be accepted into the program. The best qualified applicants will be selected each year based on the number of seats available.   All courses transferred into the Nursing Program, including nursing courses, must have a grade of C or greater for transfer credit to be granted. Courses older than 10 years will be considered for transfer on an individual basis; courses may transfer in only as electives but not count toward general education requirements.   Courses pre-requisite to the major and nursing major courses completed five years or more before admission may not transfer and may need to be repeated. The Division of Nursing Chair and the Admission and Retention Committee in the Division of Nursing will determine the transfer status of such courses. The policies for transfer credits are the same for both the pre-licensure and RN-BSN tracks.   Faculty of the Notre Dame Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program will evaluate content of nursing courses to determine if the course is comparable to one offered in the Notre Dame Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program. Students requesting transfer credit must provide a course description and course syllabus as a basis for evaluation of transfer credit. Students may be required to take proficiency tests in identified subjects to validate learning.  Any student admitted to the Nursing Program with advanced standing must meet current college and nursing program curriculum and graduation requirements at the time of admission to the program.   Transfer students requesting advanced standing in the Nursing Program must provide documentation that they are a student in good standing from a nursing program in which they were previously enrolled.  Graduation Requirements Students in the Pre-Licensure Track must demonstrate satisfactory performance on a comprehensive exit examination as described in the Nursing Division Student Handbook in order to graduate from the program.

HISTORY   Mission Statement: Through the study of history, students will come to appreciate the diverse and complex nature of humankind. The development of research and critical thinking skills used to form historical interpretations, question assumptions, think imaginatively and develop clear, well-reasoned assessments will be emphasized, along with a commitment to life-long learning.   Program Description One of the most common questions History students are asked is: “Why are you majoring in History?” On the surface, this seems like a simple question, but once you think about it you may find that it isn’t all that easy to answer. History is different things to different people, and even historians debate the meaning of historical events among themselves.  Ultimately, history is personal. History is a part of everyone’s life, and it affects us in ways we may not always think about. We live in a society that is the result of generations of development. The decisions, actions, attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, fears, hopes, and feelings of people who have come before us have brought about the world we live in today. Knowing about the past can help us both appreciate the present and understand how we as a people and a society have come to this point in time. Past experience, if carefully considered, may offer lessons for dealing with present-day situations. Some might even argue that the past may offer clues to the future.  But what can you do with a degree in History? The simple answer is anything you want to do. People in widely diverse careers attribute their success to studying history as undergraduates. For example, people with undergraduate degrees in History work as attorneys and paralegals, in business, as writers and journalists, government officials, intelligence analysts, researchers, policy analysts, politicians, broadcasters, museum curators and teachers. A list of career opportunities can be found here: http://www.historians.org/pubs/Free/careers/Index.htm  History majors at Notre Dame College also have the opportunity to work in numerous internships related to these careers. NDC History majors have interned in law offices, courts, libraries and historical societies, banks, fusion centers, think tanks and foreign embassies. And many NDC students who complete their undergraduate degrees in History eventually go on to earn graduate degrees.  Students who complete a minimum of twelve credits in history with a minimum GPA of 3.1 and an overall GPA of 3.0 or better will qualify for induction into Phi Alpha Theta, the national history honor society.  Programs Outcomes Students completing a major in History will be able to:  Demonstrate a command of key historical terms and distinctions.  Use historical language in keeping with established professional usage.  Apply key historical concepts effectively.  Demonstrate the ability to use historical analogies effectively.  Analyze historical questions and issues clearly and precisely.  206   Formulate historical information accurately, recognize and evaluate key historical assumptions.  Identify and discuss fundamental historical problems knowledgeably.  Recognize and evaluate important historical implications and consequences.  Identify and compare relevant competing historical points of view, evaluate them and argue effectively in support of a specific historical perspective or interpretation.  Demonstrate excellent historical reasoning and problem-solving.  Produce clear, precise, and well-reasoned work.
