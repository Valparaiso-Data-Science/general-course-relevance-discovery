Its antecedents, all housed in what is now the Ball State Administration Building, were also normal schools, owned and operated under various names. In 1918, the Ball brothers, a prominent Muncie industrial family, bought the property and donated it to the state of Indiana, which, in turn, transferred control of the school to the board of trustees of the Indiana State Normal School in Terre Haute. In 1922, in recognition of the generosity of the Ball brothers, the board added Ball Teachers College to the school’s name. In 1929, the Indiana General Assembly separated the two colleges, naming the Muncie campus Ball State Teachers College.  On February 8, 1965, the general assembly renamed the institution Ball State University in recognition of its phenomenal growth in enrollment and physical facilities; the variety and quality of its educational programs and services; and in anticipation of the much broader role it would be expected to assume in the future.   DESCRIPTION OF THE UNIVERSITY  Ball State University is a comprehensive, publicly assisted institution of higher learning whose mission is to provide excellent education. It is located in Muncie, Indiana, a city of 70,000, fifty-six miles northeast of Indianapolis. Although its primary concern is for the citizens of Indiana, it offers programs with appeal to regional, national, and international audiences.  Ball State University offers a strong undergraduate liberal and professional education and selected graduate programs of high quality. Ball State students can choose from a comprehensive range of academic programs at the associate, baccalaureate, and master’s levels, as well as doctoral programs in areas where the university has special competence.   The university has a selective admissions policy; in some areas, such as architecture, the university is very selective. Exceptionally well-qualified undergraduate students may enroll in the Honors College for more intellectually demanding programs of study. Students who have not decided on a major or who may need to strengthen their learning skills can take advantage of the special academic assistance and intensive educational advising offered by University College.  As part of Ball State’s commitment to excellence in education, the university offers students a friendly, collegial atmosphere; a full range of out-of-class activities; and excellent, well-planned academic, residential, and recreational facilities. An impressive array of student support services contributes to the personal, social, and intellectual development of all students.  Although Ball State University is primarily a residential academic community, it also supports programs that reach students well beyond the immediate campus. Through interactive telecommunications, Internet courses, and on-site courses, Ball State distance learning students are able to take courses and entire degree programs. The university has a strong commitment to cultural diversity and international programs. It offers exchange programs with universities throughout the world and a wide variety of opportunities for students to study abroad.  VISION  Ball State University will be a national model of excellence for challenging, learner-centered academic communities that advance knowledge and improve economic vitality and quality of life.  MISSION  4  Ball State University is an innovative, supportive academic community that inspires students by:   • Offering action-oriented learning, including immersive out-of-class experiences, research, and study-abroad;  • Providing extraordinary access to and collaboration with professors who create scholarship to advance  knowledge, improve teaching, and transform learning; and  • Engaging state, national, and international communities to enhance educational,   economic, and cultural development.  THE BENEFICENCE PLEDGE  Members of the Ball State University Community . . .  pledge to maintain high standards of scholarship and excellence To work with students, faculty, and staff to strengthen teaching and learning on campus.  pledge to practice academic honesty To model and uphold academic integrity, to honor their peers and earn the trust and respect from all members of the community.  pledge to act in a socially responsible way To treat each person in the Ball State community with civility, courtesy, compassion, and dignity; to respect the property and environment of the campus.  pledge to value the intrinsic worth of every member of the community To respect and learn from differences in people, ideas, and opinions.   ADMISSIONS    By statute, the Ball State University Board of Trustees is authorized to “prescribe the conditions for admission of students to the university, provided that graduation from a commissioned secondary school or its equivalent shall be required.” Specific admissions policies and practices are subject to change as the institution adjusts to enrollment patterns.  In order to maintain high academic standards and to ensure that students receive the best education possible at Ball State, the university limits enrollment to students meeting specific admissions requirements. In addition, the university reserves the right to determine the semester to which students are admitted on the basis of students’ academic qualifications as well as availability of space. The university also reserves the right to limit the number of nonresident students.  To be considered for admission to Ball State, a student must have graduated or be on track to graduate from an accredited secondary school or have earned a General Education Development (GED) and/or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) certificate. Students who are not high school graduates may be considered for admission to the university after they have presented evidence that they have earned GED/TASC certificates.  Both the quality and the content of secondary school academic programs are important in admission decisions. Students graduating from high school in Indiana are required to complete the academic component of the Core 40 high school curriculum. Students from other states should pursue strong college prep curricula. All students are encouraged to complete state academic honors diplomas where available. For questions related to curricula, email us at askus@bsu.edu or call the Office of Admissions at 800-482-4BSU; 765-285-8300; or TTY users only, 765-285-2205.  Applicants should obtain the most recent edition of Ball State University’s Admissions Viewbook which is available from their high school guidance offices or from Ball State’s Office of Admissions. Interested applicants should apply online at bsu.edu/admissions/apply.  Ball State University is not responsible for problems that may arise if students fail to submit complete admissions materials, including official transcripts from other institutions. Ball State class placement and registration may be impacted if complete transcripts of course work are not received in a timely manner to evaluate. All admission materials submitted, including transcripts, become the property of Ball State University.  Note: Ball State University practices rolling admissions. Admission to a particular semester may depend on date of application and space available. When enrollment goals are met for each term, admissions will close.  Admission to the university does not guarantee admission to a particular academic program. Consult the section of this catalog that applies to the appropriate department to determine admission requirements for specific programs.  PROCEDURES FOR APPLICANTS  Students with No Previous College Experience 5  Students who have had no previous college experience, after high school graduation, will be considered for admission to Ball State University after the Office of Admissions has received the following:  1. An application for admission. Applicants submit a completed application for admission before March 1 for priority consideration for fall semester, before December 1 for spring semester, and before April 1 for summer semester. Applications submitted later than the priority deadlines will be considered as space is available. Applications may be submitted up to one year in advance.   Students seeking admission to academic programs in art, dance, music, theatre, or the first-year program in the College of Architecture and Planning (CAP) will be required to provide additional information within the online application to be considered for admission to those programs. Students will also be required to provide additional information within the online application to be considered for admission to the Honors College. For information about the supplemental application process, students should contact the Office of Admissions. Students are strongly encouraged to apply early, as a limited number of students are admitted to these programs. 2. A $55 nonrefundable application fee. Applicants must pay a $55 application fee before they will be considered for admission. The fee can be paid by a credit card or electronic check process included in the online application for admission. In cases of financial difficulties or other approved reasons, a request can be made to have the application fee waived. Supporting documentation must be sent to Ball State University Office of Admissions documenting the reason for the fee waiver request on behalf of the applicant.  3. Secondary school record (official transcript) or GED/TASC certificate. Students should ask their high schools to send official copies of the secondary transcripts to the Office of Admissions, including lists of courses in progress. Students who have been home schooled or who have attended unaccredited high schools may be required to submit an official General Education Development (GED) and/or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) certificate. Transcripts or GED/TASC certificates must show that applicants meet the standards for certification as secondary school graduates. If schools send partial transcripts, students must make certain that complete official transcripts showing the specific date of graduation are submitted as soon as possible after graduation. Failure to do so will result in a registration barrier and university hold placed on the student’s record. Students who have not produced certification of high school graduation are not eligible to receive federal financial aid. If admitted, the quality of students’ academic achievement must remain the same or improve, or the admission classification may be changed or admission rescinded. 4. Standardized test scores. Applicants under the age of twenty-three must take the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and/or the American College Testing Assessment (ACT). The test scores should be sent directly to the university. Some students 23 years old or older may also be required to take the SAT or ACT. For additional information, visit bsu.edu/admissions. 5. Dual credit/college credit. Students taking college-level courses at an accredited institution while enrolled in high school must submit official college transcript(s) to the Office of Admissions in order to receive credit for completed courses. For advanced standing information, please see Advanced Standing section.  Campus Housing All students must live in university housing for two semesters unless they will be twenty-one years of age prior to the beginning of the term for which they are enrolling, have 24 or more Ball State accepted credits achieved after graduation from high school, are married or are a custodial parent of a dependent child, or are living with their parents in the parents’ primary residence which is no more than sixty miles from the Ball State University campus. When applying for admission, please indicate housing plans for the semester or term for which application is made. Admission to the university guarantees housing to entering freshmen.  Students with Previous College Experience (Transfer Students) Applicants who have previously attended post-secondary institutions, after high school graduation, should follow the same application procedures and observe the same deadlines as students with no college experience.  Admission Requirements for Transfer Applicants Admission decisions will be based upon applicants’ academic records at all educational institutions attended. Applicants must be in good academic standing and eligible to return immediately to the institution last attended.  To be considered for admission, applicants must have cumulative grade-point averages of at least 2.0 on a 4.0 scale for all transferable course work attempted. Remedial, vocational, and courses from institutions that are not regionally accredited (Middle States Association, North Central Association, New England Association, Northwest Association, Southern Association, Western Association) are not transferable. Although credit earned from unaccredited colleges and universities is not accepted at Ball State University as transfer credit, transcripts from all such institutions attended are still required.  Students who apply for admission to Ball State University while currently enrolled at other colleges and universities may be admitted with condition to Ball State on incomplete transcripts based on their current college or university cumulative grade-point averages. Admission granted under such circumstances will be withdrawn if the cumulative grade-point average falls below 2.0.  Students who were not admissible to Ball State out of high school and not offered another pathway into Ball State will be asked to complete a minimum of 24 credits of college-level course work (remedial or skill building classes do not count) and earn a minimum cumulative grade-point average of 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) at an accredited two- or four-year college or university before being considered for admission to Ball State as a transfer student. 6   Acceptance of Transfer Credit. Generally, all nonremedial, nonvocational courses in which a student earns a 2.0 or better at colleges and universities accredited by regional accrediting agencies are accepted by Ball State University. Students may petition the appropriate academic department for the acceptance of vocational courses. Only course credit transfers to Ball State University; no grades transfer.  Information about how credits will transfer to Ball State may be obtained through transferin.net or contact the office of admissions at 765-285-8300 or transfer@bsu.edu. Courses at Ball State University are offered on a semester and term basis, and credits earned are in semester hours. To convert quarter hours to semester hours, multiply the number of quarter hours by 2/3. Two semester hours are generally equivalent to three quarter hours. Ball State University has procedures in place to accommodate conversions.  Application of Transfer Credit. For admitted students, the application of transfer credit toward a degree at Ball State University will be finalized during a meeting with an academic advisor. Official Ball State University course equivalents will be established by the academic advisor in consultation with the appropriate academic department.  Transfer of Credit Earned in Vocational Degree Programs. Vocational degree programs are designed to prepare students for immediate employment rather than for further study at other colleges or universities; therefore, such credits are not directly transferable. For example, degree programs in automotive repair, cosmetology, commercial driving, etc., are considered to be vocational studies. Exceptions to this rule are made when the providers of occupational programs and Ball State University have agreements for transferring credits.  IVY Tech Community College of Indiana credits. Ball State will accept the Ivy Tech credits articulated with Indiana’s public universities if they were taken in the fall of 1993 or later. All other credits earned in the fall of 1995 or later will be accepted in transfer except those courses that are primarily vocational in nature.  Transfer Student Housing Policy. All transfer students who have 24 or fewer credits must live in university housing unless they are 21 years of age, married, living with their parents in the parents’ primary residence which is no more than 60 miles from the Ball State campus, or have completed two semesters at Ball State. Admission to the university guarantees housing to transfer students in this category.  Former Ball State University Undergraduate Students Former Ball State students who stop out, for a year or longer time period, and wish to re-enter the university must submit a reenrollment application to the Office of the Registrar. This application can be found at bsu.edu/admissions/apply, scrolling to “Steps for Other Students” and selecting “Re-enrolling or Reinstating”. The deadline for reenrollment consideration is seven days before the official start of each term.    Students who have a break in continuous semester attendance or who have attended other institutions since last attending Ball State University and who were in good standing with Ball State University at the time of stop out will be considered reenrolling students. Students must submit official transcripts for any work completed at other institutions to the Office of the Registrar.   Former Ball State students not in good academic standing with Ball State University as determined by the Registrar (academic disqualification) must apply for reinstatement. This process requires an application, found at bsu.edu/registrar, (under Registration Activities and click to returning student) and official transcripts if another institution was attended during the stop out period.  All documentation must be submitted to the Committee of Admission and Credits, Office of the Registrar, no later than 7 days before the official start of each term. For a list of important dates, please visit the Registrar’s website at bsu.edu/registrar - click on Registration activities and select returning student. Applicants should submit documents early in order to complete the requirements for application and to allow time for the committee to consider all documentation.   Admission of International Students to Ball State University  Students who are not citizens, permanent residents, asylees, refugees, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) of the United States must enroll at Ball State University through the Rinker Center for International Programs. Prospective students must meet all of the university’s international student admission requirements.  In addition to submitting a special admission application and all supporting academic credentials, students must have evidence of adequate financial support for expenses–including tuition, fees, books, supplies, maintenance (lodging and food), health insurance, taxes, and miscellaneous expenditures (clothing, local travel, recreation, toiletries, telephone, etc.).   A student intending to enroll at Ball State University may be required to retake the TOEFL or IELTS before being admitted, regardless of the extent of previous training in English. Any exceptions to these rules must be approved by the Rinker Center for International Programs. For information about this program contact TOEFL at toefl.org, IELTS at ielts.org, or Pearson PTE at pearsonpte.com.   Any student admitted conditionally with a score lower than 79 (internet-based) on the TOEFL, 6.5 on the IELTS, or 53 on the Pearson PTE will be required to take an English language proficiency exam during orientation to determine the English language courses that must be taken through the Intensive English Institute. Upon completion of the IEI program or submitting a TOEFL, IELTS, or Pearson PTE that meets minimum admission requirements, the students must pursue full time academic study. Exceptions to these rules must be approved by the Rinker Center for International Programs and the Intensive English Institute. Any 7  international student may take a course in English as a foreign language, for credit or noncredit, regardless of whether such a course is required. Any student who is required to take a course in English as a foreign language and whose progress is unsatisfactory will be required to repeat the course if the Intensive English Institute, Rinker Center for International Programs, and the chairperson of the relevant department deem it advisable.   Upon enrollment, international students are assessed nonresident tuition and fees for undergraduate and graduate courses offered by the university. The university currently has a limited number of scholarships authorized by the University Board of Trustees that may be awarded to outstanding and deserving students from other countries. These scholarships are equivalent in value to a partial waiver of university tuition fees. No scholarships are available for room, board, or transportation costs.  Successful applicants will be sent documentation allowing them to apply for a student visa through United States consular representatives in their home countries. All international students are required to participate in a health insurance plan designed for Ball State University students unless approved for a waiver. The premium must be along with nonresident tuition and fees and must be maintained throughout the student’s period of enrollment at the university.  Upon arrival at Ball State, students are required to attend special orientation sessions during which registration information and other relevant student issues are discussed. An English language examination will be administered to those students who require the test at this time to determine language competency.  Prospective students are encouraged to inquire at least one year before proposed enrollment at Ball State by contacting the Rinker Center for International Programs or by visiting bsu.edu/internationaladmit. Students who have a break in continuous semester attendance or who have attended other institutions since last attending Ball State and who were in good standing with Ball State at the time of stop out will be considered reenrolling students. Please refer to the information above.  ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS  All new freshman applicants to Ball State University are individually reviewed and evaluated. Admission is based on the following:  Strength of curriculum (including the senior year)—Students should pursue the best college preparatory curriculum available. For Indiana applicants, Ball State requires completion of the academic component of the Core 40 curriculum as the minimum preparation for students who are college bound; however, completion of the Academic Honors Diploma is strongly encouraged. Students from other states should pursue strong college prep curricula.  Performance as measured by grades in English, mathematics (Algebra I, Geometry, and Algebra II are minimum requirements), laboratory sciences, social sciences, and foreign languages.  Curriculum patterns and grade trends in the above courses—The Office of Admissions expects a balanced academic program with at least four college preparatory classes each semester and grades that reflect a steady or upward trend in academic performance.  Standardized test scores—SAT/ACT scores are weighed in relation to high school grades and are used to identify particular strengths or weaknesses in students’ preparation for college. Scores weigh more heavily in selection for Honors College admission and Presidential Scholarship consideration. (Ball State superscores, which means we take the best score from each section for a final score.)  Honors College Admission Indiana applicants who earn Academic Honors Diplomas and out-of-state applicants who pursue comparable curricula may be reviewed for Honors College admission. Performance in academic course work and standardized test scores will be evaluated. (See the Ball State University Honors College website for details, bsu.edu/honors.)  ENROLLMENT DEPOSIT  Students admitted as undergraduates to the university for the first time must accept their formal offers of admission by completing the Enrollment Confirmation process and paying the $100 non-refundable enrollment deposit online at my.bsu.edu. Enrollment Confirmation instructions can be found in the student’s admission packet. The deposit will be applied directly to first-semester fees. The deadline for fall and summer semesters is May 1 and for spring semester the deadline is January 1. In cases of financial difficulties, a guidance counselor may request, in writing, that the enrollment deposit be deferred for a student.  ORIENTATION  Freshmen and transfer students participate in a required orientation program. Orientation is a learning experience that helps students understand academic and career expectations, become involved in collegiate life, and learn about the transition period students may experience as they enter college. During Orientation students meet with academic advisors, register for courses, and get their Ball State (ID Card). Admitted students who have paid the enrollment deposit will receive information authorizing the student to select an orientation date. Family members are encouraged to attend Orientation.   8  SPECIAL ENROLLMENT    Enrollment as Guest Students Students regularly enrolled and in good academic standing at other colleges or universities who wish to attend Ball State University for one semester may apply as guest students. To be eligible, students must have minimum cumulative grade-point averages of 2.0 (on a 4.0 scale) and be eligible to return immediately to their home institutions. Guest applications are available at bsu.edu/admissions/apply, scrolling to “Steps for Other Students” and selecting “Guests” and click the box “Apply Now.” Students must submit official college transcripts to the Office of the Registrar.  Within seven days of application receipt, applicant will receive notification from the Help Desk providing Ball State Credentials.  Additionally, if application is approved, the Office of the Registrar will send official notification outlining next steps.  Enrollment as Non-degree Students Students who wish to enroll for personal and professional development rather than in pursuit of degrees may apply as non-degree students. Non-degree student applications are available at bsu.edu/admissions/apply, scrolling to “Steps for Other Students” and selecting the tab “Apply as a Non-degree student.” Students must submit official high school transcripts, the General Education Development (GED) certificate and/or Test Assessing Secondary Completion (TASC) certificate, or college transcripts. Applicants must have earned a high school diploma or GED/TASC certificate and not be currently enrolled in post-secondary institutions. In addition, a student applying that has post-secondary course work must be in good standing – a minimum cumulative grade-point average of a 2.0 on a 4.0 scale and eligibility to return to the last post-secondary institution attended. Please note: financial aid is not available to non-degree students. If you have applied for and been denied regular or online admissions, you must have 24 transferable credits from another institution to be admitted as a non-degree seeking students. Non-traditional students must have a GPA of 2.5 or better on their high school transcript to be admitted as a non-degree seeking student.      Initial Enrollment as Non-degree Students. Before course registration, students registering for courses must call Upper Division Academic Advising for appointments, 765-285-5490. Students must meet all course prerequisites and departmental requirements. In addition to academic advising, students will be eligible for other services offered through University College and the Division of Online and Distance Education. If a student does not achieve the academic standards required their first term of enrollment, they are subject to all institutional policies.   Continuing Enrollment as Non-degree Students. The maximum number of semester credits that non-degree students may earn is 31. In addition, students will be subject to all university policies and regulations, including those pertaining to academic probation and dismissal.   Changing to Degree Status. Students in good academic standing at the conclusion of the semester in which they have completed 20 semester credits may apply for regular admission. If admitted, students will be eligible to pursue degrees. At any time during non-degree enrollment, students may submit the required materials to be considered for admission to pursue degrees.  Admission as Auditors All students who meet the general requirements for admission to Ball State University may enroll as auditors in credit courses upon approval of the academic department offering the course and the Office of the Registrar. Auditors do not earn academic credits or grades. Students who have audited courses cannot later test out of those courses. Auditors must pay auditors’ fees for each course unless the course requires full fees.  Applications can be obtained from the Office of Registrar, Lucina Hall, Room B43, three to five days prior to the first day of classes of each semester or term. If an application is approved, applicant must visit the Office of Registrar to be enrolled in requested course. No online courses are available to be audited.   If space is needed for students who want to earn credit in the course, auditors’ registrations will be canceled and their money fully refunded. If auditing students choose not to attend the course, however, fees are not refunded. Faculty members may not admit anyone to class as an auditor who has not officially registered.  ADVANCED STANDING  Ball State University offers opportunities to earn credit toward a degree for knowledge students have acquired independently, at work, in the military, through workshops and special classes, and in other ways. Most of these opportunities require that students take an examination to “test out” of a course or group of courses. Credit earned in this way counts toward graduation requirements, but students do not receive a grade for it. Students cannot receive credit of this type for courses for which they have already received credit. Students can earn up to 63 credits through this program.  The opportunities for earning advanced standing are: 9   Advanced Placement Program  International Baccalaureate Certificates or Diploma  College Level Exam Program (CLEP tests—subject and general)  Credit by departmental examination  Credit by departmental authorization  Credit earned while in military service  Credit for foreign language proficiency Any department may, at its discretion, administer an examination for any course offered in the department. The department also determines the standards for passing these examinations. Students who earn passing scores will be granted credit for the courses. Credit by examination will not be awarded to students who have been enrolled or are currently enrolled in the courses for credit or audit.  Credit by departmental authorization may be granted for learning experiences the department believes to be the equivalent of college work. No grade is given for this credit. Credit and advanced placement in foreign languages and mathematics may be awarded through the Advanced Credit Placement Test that is available online and can be taken prior to attending freshman orientation. Testing instructions are mailed to students with their orientation invitation. Students must receive placement through the testing process before registering for the appropriate courses. For more information, visit bsu.edu/admissions/credit to learn how Ball State awards advanced credit.  Ball State University will accept courses for transfer evaluation and advanced standing credit transcript posting only if the student is currently enrolled.  RESIDENCY  Because Ball State University is financially supported by Indiana legislative appropriations, resident students pay less in fees than out-of-state students. Residency status, as determined by the Registrar in accordance with rules adopted by the Board of Trustees, is subject to change. Residency status depends primarily upon the length of time a person has lived in Indiana for purposes other than attending a college or university. A minimum residency of a year is required for independent students (not claimed as dependents by parents or guardians on their income tax forms). The student bears the burden of proof in making a claim of resident status. To request a change in residency classification, a student must file an application form and provide proof of residency in Indiana. Copies of the regulations, the Application for Nonresident Fee Exemption, and other information are available in the Office of Registrar, Lucina Hall, Room B43, or at online at bsu.edu/registrar by selecting “Miscellaneous Information” and click “Review guidelines.”   FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS  The staff members in the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships are eager to assist you. Over three-fourths of all Ball State students receive some form of financial aid, including scholarships, grants, loans, and student employment. To be considered for most financial aid programs, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) must be received by the federal processor on or before April 15. Apply online at fafsa.gov. For more information, contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships at 800-227-4017 or 765-285-5600 or visit bsu.edu/finaid.  Degree Requirements and Time Limit   DEGREE REQUIREMENTS  Degree requirements are those in effect on the date of a student’s first registration for credit after admission. Students may, however, choose to complete a particular major, minor, or two-year program under the requirements of the most recent catalog. Students who change a major, minor, or two-year program must meet the requirements of the new program as stated in the catalog current when the change is made.  TIME LIMIT  There is no specific time limit for the completion of undergraduate degrees, but the university reserves the right to review course work that is more than seven years old. Furthermore, the university is neither obligated nor committed to continue courses or programs so that students can take more than the normal four or five years to complete bachelor’s degrees or more than two years to complete associate degrees.  10  CREDITS  Class standing and grade-point averages at Ball State University are determined at the close of the term on the basis of semester credits. Generally, one hour of class time a week equals one credit. For example, most classes at Ball State carry 3 credits, and they meet for approximately three hours each week.  CLASS STANDING  Undergraduate students are designated as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors during their academic careers at Ball State. Students who have earned fewer than 30 semester credits are freshmen. Students who have earned 30 credits or more but fewer than 60 credits are sophomores. Students who have earned 60 credits or more but fewer than 90 credits are juniors. Students who have earned 90 credits or more are seniors.  COURSE LOAD  The normal course load in a semester is 12 to 18 credits. (During a semester, 9 to 11 credits is considered a three-quarter-time load; 6 to 8 credits is considered a half-time load.) A total of twelve credits in a semester is considered a full course load for undergraduate students. Freshmen are not eligible to register for more than 18 credits unless they have met the following conditions:  1. They have earned previous residence credit at Ball State University.  2. They have cumulative grade-point averages of at least 3.0.  3. They have successfully completed all of their scheduled courses in the preceding semester or term.  Students who are on academic probation may not register for more than 18 credits in a semester or term.  GRADES  Grades The university reports and records grades using the plus/minus letter system. Quality points are allocated to each recorded grade according to the following scale: A = 4.000 B+ = 3.333 C+ = 2.333 D+ = 1.333 F  = 0 A- = 3.667 B = 3.000 C  = 2.000 D   = 1.000   B- = 2.667 C-  = 1.667 D-  = 0.667  Programs requiring C or better grades will not accept a C- grade (unless specified otherwise). A student’s grade-point average (GPA) is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points by the total number of GPA credits.  A grade of F is recorded when a student fails a course or withdraws from a course after the withdrawal period unless, in the judgment of the dean of the instructor’s college, the reasons for withdrawing from a course warrant a W.  FN (Non-attendance) represents a failing grade awarded to the student who did not attend a course (no completed assignments, no exams, no instructor interaction or other documented engagement in an academically-related activity in the course).   FS (Stopped attendance) represents a failing grade awarded to a student who did not officially withdraw but failed to complete a course (i.e., did not take a final exam, stopped attending, etc.) and failed to achieve the course objectives. Instructors will be required to enter the last date of academic engagement for the student receiving a grade of FS.  A failing grade (F, FN, or FS) is recorded when a student withdraws from a course after the published withdrawal deadline for the semester or term unless, in the judgement of the instructor or college dean, the reasons for withdrawing from the course are such that the student should have a W.   CR is recorded for students registered under credit/no credit provisions who do work that is 2.0 or above.  NC is recorded for students registered under credit/no credit provisions who do work that is below 2.0.  I represents incomplete work and is given only when it is determined that the student should be given an opportunity to finish the work. The instructor, along with the department chairperson, decides whether to award an incomplete grade in a course and outlines the requirements and time limit for completing the work. It is most important that the conditions for removing the I be as specific as possible. Removal of an I grade should be limited to as short a period as possible. CR/NC enrollments will expire to become a failing grade as defined by the grading method. All other enrollments expire to an F grade. Unless an earlier completion data is specified by the instructor, an I grade awarded for an undergraduate course will expire as follows: for Fall enrollment, by May 1; for Spring and/or Summer enrollment, by December 1. An exception is made when an extension on the timeline has been recommended by a department chairperson and approved by the appropriate dean. The Registrar’s Office will send an email reminder to the student and to the instructor of an I grade on the student record on or about the 15th of every month.    NR represents a grade not properly reported by an instructor. The instructor must assign a grade by the fifth week of the next term. If an NR grade is not removed by the fifth week of the following (academic year) term, the Registrar’s Office will change the grade to F or to NC if it is a credit or no credit course.  W represents an official withdrawal from a course. 11  Students who want to take courses without credit to apply toward a degree (auditors) sign waivers for the specific courses. Students must make audit adjustments prior to the end of the add/drop period for the term of enrollment. Students earn no academic credit for auditing classes. Such classes are represented by the entry AU on the student’s transcript.  At the close of each semester or term, students may access grades at my.bsu.edu. Any correction in a grade already reported must be made by the instructor and approved by the department chairperson and the dean of the instructor’s college before it is filed in the Registrar’s Office. Any such change must be completed within one year of the close of the session for which the grade was due.  Dean’s List. Undergraduates who earn at least a 3.5 grade-point average for 12 or more credits of graded course work during a semester or for 6 or more credits of graded course work during a summer term will be named to the dean’s list for that semester or term. Course enrollment under the grading option of credit/no credit is not used in Dean’s List calculation. This designation will be placed on students’ academic transcript.  CREDIT/NO CREDIT POLICY  Students may choose to earn up to 15 credits under the credit/no credit option; if a course is offered only for credit/no credit, it will not be counted in the fifteen-credit allowance. Students who have taken a course for a grade cannot take it again on a credit/no credit basis. Courses taken on a credit/no credit basis will not count toward the academic major, minor, or any University Core Curriculum requirements, except for student teaching, internships, and courses offered only for credit/no credit. If a student has taken courses in a particular subject for credit/no credit and then decides to major or minor in that subject, not more than two of the courses will count toward the major or minor requirements. Students on academic probation may not use the credit/no credit option. With these exceptions, departments must allow students to take courses for credit/no credit.  MINIMUM GRADE REQUIREMENTS  A student will be placed on academic probation at the close of a term when the cumulative grade-point average is less than 2.0. At the close of a term, the Office of the Registrar will notify students who are on academic probation of their status, including any requirements the University establishes to help improve their academic performance.  Students on academic probation may be required to repeat courses, enroll in no more than 18 credits, take courses in reading and study skills, attend academic progress meetings sponsored by the Office of the Registrar, attend workshops and seminars on academic success, obtain advisor’s approval to make schedule changes, and enroll in class sections that offer supplemental instruction. Students who are informed by the registrar that they have been placed on academic probation should immediately meet with an academic advisor to discuss plans for improvement. Academic standing is determined at the end of a semester. To avoid academic dismissal a student on academic probation must meet the following conditions:  A student with less than 30 earned credits at the end of the semester, (including transfer credit and other credit granted) is required to earn a 2.0 term grade-point average at the end of the probation term and each following term until the cumulative average reaches 2.0 or above.  A student with 30 or more earned credits at the end of the semester, (including transfer credit and other credit granted) is required to earn a 2.1 term grade-point average at the end of the probation term and each following term until the cumulative average reaches 2.0 or above.   Transferred credits from other colleges and universities will be included in determining the number of completed credits. The grades from those institutions will not be used in figuring the cumulative grade-point average.   Students dismissed from Ball State for academic reasons cannot be reinstated for at least two semesters (summer is considered a semester). To be reinstated, students must complete an application form available from the Office of the Registrar and submit it to the Office of the Registrar for review by the appropriate date established by the Registrar’s Office. The request cannot be reviewed if a “university hold” has been placed on the student record or if the university has not received official transcripts of grades from all other schools attended since the last semester of attendance at Ball State. Reinstatement to the university does not ensure admission to a particular college or program.  Ball State is not obligated to reinstate students who have been dismissed. Students granted reinstatement must show that they have sufficient aptitude to pursue their intended program of study. They must also show signs of increased maturity, increased commitment to education, and adequate financial resources to attend Ball State without excessive employment. Students may not apply for reinstatement more than once in a twelve-month period. Normally, students who have been disqualified will not be reinstated more than once in a three-year period.  All degree programs require that students earn a grade-point average of at least 2.0 overall and in each major, minor, certificate, and the University Core Curriculum. Some programs—for example, teacher education—have higher minimum requirements.  Academic Clemency. Undergraduate students who were not enrolled at Ball State University for a five-year period may petition the Office of the Registrar to have grades and credits earned before that period removed from the calculation of their cumulative grade-point averages. Students participating in the program are specifically required to comply with the following provisions: 12   The student must not already have an earned degree from Ball State University.  University records must verify that they were not registered in any capacity at Ball State University for a period of at least five years.  For students who qualify for academic clemency, all previous Ball State University course work with grades of C or above will be counted for credit only. However, students will lose credit for all courses with grades below C and resume their academic program with no cumulative grade-point average and marks placed in the student record.  The student’s academic records will be inscribed with the note “Academic Clemency Granted (date).”  Academic clemency may be used only one time by a Ball State University student.  Academic clemency is final and irreversible.  All other policies of Ball State University apply.   Call the Office of the Registrar, 765-285-1722, for more information on the deadlines for applications for reinstatement or academic clemency.  STUDENT RECORDS  At the close of each term, enrolled students may view grade reports showing attempted credits, earned credits, quality points, grade-point average for the term, and cumulative grade-point average on the university’s student services Web site my.bsu.edu. Permanent academic records are kept in the Registrar’s Office.  Midterm Evaluation of Undergraduates By the end of the eighth week of the semester, faculty will submit a midterm grade for all students whose grades are C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NC. This policy will apply to all classes and grades will be made available to students. Each student’s academic advisor will receive notification of the student’s performance, and, if a student lives in a residence hall, the residence hall director also will receive this information. The purpose of the midterm evaluation is to provide students with information about their current classroom performance as well as provide information to support personnel for students whose performance may result in a grade of less than a C. It is ultimately the student’s responsibility to respond appropriately to this information. The midterm grade does not guarantee a specific performance at the end of the semester but is merely notice of the student’s performance to that time. This policy excludes all summer and part of term classes.  COURSES  Course Repetition An undergraduate student may repeat a course an unlimited number of times except in cases where a department has imposed repetition limits. The repetition of a course does not remove the previous grades from the student’s official academic record. A W will not replace a previous grade. The last grade in a course will be used in computing the student’s grade-point average. The credits will count only once toward meeting minimum credit requirements for graduation. The University is not obligated to offer courses so that a student can repeat them. Students are strongly encouraged to meet regularly with an advisor.    The university reserves the right to modify or cancel courses when necessary because of accreditation requirements, insufficient enrollment, lack of staff members, or for financial or other reasons. In addition, the chairperson of a department can transfer students from one section of a class to another section of the same class.  Departments can substitute courses to meet major and minor requirements as long as the substitution does not reduce the number of credits required in the program. Either a student or a department can request a course substitution before the alternate course is taken. The department chairperson must sign a copy of the approval of the substitution; the form must then be submitted to the appropriate advising center.  Students who need to change their class schedules can do so any time after their initial registration through the end of the add/drop time frame. There is no charge for changes made during this time frame.  Extended Education Courses The Division of Online and Distance Education offers a wide variety of courses to meet continuing or extended education needs.   Students enrolled in extended education courses are entitled to the support services of University Libraries and Unified Technology Support. Access to other services and facilities is only available to students who have paid all necessary fees.  Ball State students enrolled in any extended education course will only receive residence credit for those courses that originate at Ball State University.   For students pursuing a degree at Ball State University, there may be a limit to the number of independent learning credits that will count toward a major or minor. To inquire about the limitations governing degree programs, contact the academic department responsible for the major or minor.   13  Class Attendance A student’s official course program is regarded as a contract with the university. Since full performance requires, in part, regular and punctual class attendance, students are expected to attend all classes for which they are registered. Faculty will establish attendance policies for their courses and communicate those policies through course syllabi or outlines.  Students who know they must be absent from a class should notify the instructor or departmental office. Courtesy requires that students speak to the instructor and preferably present a signed and dated memo briefly stating the reasons for absence.  Faculty members are responsible for keeping records of attendance of all students registered in each class. Students are responsible for completing any work they have missed. The faculty member is not required to do extra teaching to help students “catch up.”  Right to Bereavement Leave Students will be excused from class in the event of the death of a close friend or member of the student’s family or household. The number of excused absences allowed is determined by the distance of funeral services from Muncie, Indiana, as follows:  Three work days—150-mile radius of Muncie  Four work days—Between 150-300 mile radius of Muncie  Five work days—Beyond 300-mile radius of Muncie  Seven work days—Outside of North America   If the student is unable to attend the funeral services, the student will be allowed three school days for bereavement.  Given proper documentation, the instructor will excuse the student from class and provide the opportunity to earn equivalent credit for assignments missed. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome, he or she may appeal as outlined in Ball State University’s Procedure for Student Bereavement Appeals found in the Code of Student Rights and Responsibilities.  Field Trips Field trips consistent with the purpose of the course should be planned at the beginning of the semester. Absence caused by field trips in a course or by official university responsibilities will be announced in advance to the instructors of the course(s) in which the student is enrolled. Students obtain these notices through the department chairperson’s office and take them to their instructors at least three days in advance of the absence. No field trips, travel, or other special events involving students are scheduled during the first week or the last two weeks of a semester. Exceptions will be granted only after consultation with and approval by the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs. Whenever possible, trips should be scheduled for weekends.  Field trips are voluntary, but a course grade may be lowered if students do not go on a field trip and do not complete adequate make-up work as assigned.  Internships and Practica The university encourages student internships and practica. Internships and practica are defined as supervised practical experience in a student’s field of study. In order to be recorded on the student’s academic transcript, the internship or practicum must have an academic component. Academic supervision must be conducted by faculty in the student’s major or minor course of study in collaboration with a supervisor at the internship or practicum site. Academic internships and practica must be approved by the department chairperson or a designated representative of the student’s major or minor course of study.  WITHDRAWAL  Withdrawal from a Course  Change of Course Period Students may make changes to their schedule through the add/drop period. Specific calendar dates may be viewed on the website bsu.edu/registrar. Courses dropped through this period are not recorded on the student’s permanent record.    14  Course Withdrawal Period Students may withdraw from courses from the start date of the course through 60% of the scheduled duration of the course. Specific calendar dates may be viewed on the website at bsu.edu/registrar. NOTE: Saturday is not considered a class day for these purposes. The course withdrawal period is determined according to the following schedule:  from the sixth to the forty-fifth day of classes in a semester;  from the sixth to the thirtieth day of classes in a summer semester;  from the fourth to the fifteenth day of classes in a five week session.  From the fifth day to the twenty-fourth day of classes in an eight week session. Students wishing to withdraw from a course during this period should first discuss the withdrawal with their instructor. All student-initiated withdrawals will be recorded as a final grade of W during this period. However, students who discontinue enrollment or who abandon courses without following the withdrawal policy’s procedures will normally earn a failing grade in those courses. Students should contact the Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships prior to withdrawing to determine how it will affect your financial aid. To see the impact of the withdrawal on your bursar account view your ebill account online. Additional information can be found at bsu.edu/bursar.    Withdrawal after the Course Withdrawal Period        If there are verifiable extenuating circumstances which make withdrawal from a course academically justified after the withdrawal period ends, the college dean or designate may grant an exception to the above withdrawal policy. The faculty member is responsible for recording the last date of attendance and determining a withdrawal or failing grade. To see the impact of the withdrawal on your bursar account, view your ebill account online. Additional information can be found at bsu.edu/bursar.  Withdrawal from All Classes Students who find it necessary to withdraw from all courses during a semester must immediately contact the appropriate university office, as follows:  Students enrolled in all main campus courses, or in a blended schedule of main campus and online/distance education courses, should contact the Office of Retention and Graduation, SC L-20, 765-285-3312. Students enrolled exclusively in courses through Online and Distance Education should see bsu.edu/distance, or call 1-800-872-0369.   A student may be eligible for a refund of registration fees charged only if the student withdraws from all classes during any semester. Further, the only fees that are eligible for a refund are registration fees. There is no refund of the applied music fee for either the matriculated or the non-matriculated student.  The following schedule indicates the prorated portion of the registration fees a student may be eligible to receive provided the student complies with the University’s policy for withdrawing from all classes through the Office of Retention and Grauation.

Preamble: Core Goals for Undergraduate Education  Graduates of Ball State University are individuals who realize their intellectual potential, who seek to add breadth and depth to their perspectives, and who maintain their physical well-being.   Graduates of the university command extensive knowledge and a mature repertoire of cognitive, practical, and technological skills. They exhibit integrity and responsible action in their social, professional, and civic lives. They respect the histories, cultures, and needs of others. They inform their decisions through critical, creative, and scientific reasoning, and they discern the consequences of their decisions and actions at the local, national, and global levels. They acknowledge responsibility for environmental well-being and for the civic engagement that a diverse democracy requires.   Employing scientific, critical, and creative thinking, Ball State graduates transform  Experience into information (isolate discrete, recognizable and usable facts),  Information into knowledge (analyze facts within an intellectual framework, discover meaning in experience),  Knowledge into judgment (reflect on knowledge gained to make choices and direct what they think, say and do),  Judgment into action (take individual responsibility and contribute to the well-being of their communities).   B. Goals and Objectives  To achieve this vision and accomplish these transformations, student learning experiences are guided by a recursive, intellectual development process inherent in the following goals:  1. To transform experience into information, Ball State graduates are intentional learners who   accurately observe and measure elements of the natural and social worlds,   are alert to the importance of context,   explore diverse ways of knowing,   develop strategies for reflecting on experience.   2. To transform information into knowledge, Ball State graduates are informed, flexible thinkers who   analyze data to reveal existing patterns of information and to create new patterns;   understand the various ways that information is incorporated into branches of knowledge;   work independently as well as collaboratively to generate knowledge;   develop an intellectual framework with which to synthesize information from multiple sources;   adapt their intellectual framework to accommodate new information;   develop the art of communication—oral, visual, and written—in more than one language (natural and/or symbolic).   3. To transform knowledge into judgment, Ball State graduates are critical and creative thinkers who   use multiple sources of information and knowledge in forming judgments;   evaluate strengths and weaknesses of arguments and actions;   understand the ethical implications of possessing and using knowledge;   take an inquiring stance toward the world while appreciating the contributions of tradition;   consider and understand others’ values as well as their own;   value diversity in the social and natural world;   develop effective decision-making strategies based on an awareness of their own strengths and weaknesses;  understand how their actions affect the complex, interrelated systems that compose our environment.   4. To transform judgment into action, Ball State graduates are responsible learners who  recognize the responsibilities of an educated person to self, family, community, country, and the world;  accept the responsibility to act on their principles;  adapt to change;  work with others to overcome obstacles to communication, building consensus for action;  communicate effectively—in oral, visual and written modes, and in more than one language (natural and/or symbolic);  adopt habits of mind for continuous inquiry about themselves, others, and the world;   act responsibly given the dangers to and the fragility of the natural environment;  26   make and act on a commitment to health and wellness.   C. Rationale for the University Core Curriculum (UCC)  In keeping with the recursive nature of learning transformations and the goals stated in the Preamble and the Goals and Objectives, the core curriculum is designed to enable students to   realize their intellectual potential,   add breadth and depth to their educational experience,   increase their personal well-being, and   participate actively in their communities.   Moreover, the University recognizes its responsibility to ensure that students are conversant with ways of knowing, with criteria for judgment, and with types of information outside their majors. To succeed in the 21st Century, where work often requires a group effort by experts from multiple disciplines, university graduates will need to form, lead, or be members of problem-solving, brainstorming, or decision-making teams in a wide variety of professional settings. Thus the core curriculum requires students to engage disciplines outside the domains of knowledge in which their majors reside, to develop skills in written and oral communication, to become mathematically, scientifically, and historically literate, and to understand issues in the areas of physical wellness and personal finance. Any forward-looking curriculum must also address the mounting issues, problems, and opportunities in the areas of civic engagement, diversity, and international and environmental awareness.   The UCC has six distinguishing features:   Intellectual development: As indicated in the Preamble and Goals and Objectives, UCC courses must have intellectual development goals, not simply content area requirements.   Exposure to multiple domains: The UCC ensures that students will be able to distinguish among domains of knowledge based on their specific epistemologies and methods, as well as on the basis of content.   Integration of 21st Century skills: In addition to developing writing skills beyond those of the required course in English composition, the UCC asks students to engage issues related to civic life, diverse cultures, and the environment, not in separate courses for each of these areas, but in courses that address one or more of these areas either inside or outside the major, inside or outside the UCC.   Integration of Core courses and the major: The UCC allows course work in the major to count for as many as six credits in the Core as long as the courses in the major meet learning transformation requirements.   Experiential/immersion experience or similar learning experience: The UCC envisions that students will demonstrate the ability to work successfully in the major (and related areas, as appropriate) through experiences that are cumulative and integrative, that include individual or collaborative reflective components, and that provide an opportunity to communicate, both orally and in writing, at a level expected of a college graduate.   Learning outcomes: The UCC encourages participation by any department in the university because the acceptability of courses for the core depends on learning outcomes, as well as course content.    Writing Proficiency Program. All baccalaureate students must satisfy the Writing Proficiency Requirement prior to graduation. All WPP courses have as a prerequisite completion of  Principles of Marketing (3)  Principles of Marketing (3)  Principles of Marketing (3) 6     –––––     87 crs Students are placed in the pre-interior design program for the first two years.

Turcotte, Chairperson  bsu.edu/geography  Geography as a science is distinguished by the spatial approach to understanding the mechanisms of the world’s physical and human environments and the linkages between them. Human geography is specifically concerned with the spatial aspects of human activities, while physical geography examines the spatial processes explaining the Earth’s physical environment. Both human and physical geographers develop skills in cartography, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing. To meet society’s needs for greater geographic and geospatial understanding in the twenty-first century, the Department of Geography offers 310  bachelor’s degrees (BA/BS) in Geography (with four distinct concentrations) as well as a Bachelor of Science in Meteorology and Climatology.  All programs prepare students for employment as well as graduate study.   Degrees in Geography  Concentration 1. Human Geography. This concentration is designed for students interested in the human dimensions of geography. Whether from a social science or humanities perspective, students apply interests in urbanization, religion, language, population, economics, ethnicity, and politics in a spatial context that includes local, regional, and global scales. Students are also able to minor in Concentration 1. While some Concentration 1 students continue their studies at the graduate level, there also exist employment opportunities in government agencies as well as the private sector.  Concentration 2. Travel and tourism. This concentration provides students the geographical knowledge, the analytical skills, and the practical experience that are beneficial for successful careers in the travel/tourism industry. The sequence of specialized courses addresses the spatial, organizational, social, and economic aspects of sustainable tourism development, as well as the interaction between tourists and destinations. The program’s graduates are in demand in varied travel industry fields including retail travel, tour operations, meetings and conventions, transportation and hospitality companies, along with governmental, corporate, and community organizations involved in travel/tourism promotion and development.  Concentration 3. GIScience. This concentration is a technical specialization for students interested in solving social and environmental problems through advanced spatial information technology. Students learn how to visualize information in ways that reveal relationships, patterns, and trends by using computer software for cartography, remote sensing, and GIS. Cartography is the art and science of making maps; remote sensing provides a means to capture visual and digital information about the earth through airborne cameras and advanced electronic spaceborne sensors; a geographic information system is a set of computer tools for analyzing spatial data. Geographic information processing and mapping systems are used by many public and private organizations worldwide, and students graduating with these technical skills are in great demand.  Concentration 4. Meteorological Studies. This concentration is intended for students with interests in weather and climate who seek positions in which knowledge of meteorology and climatology is ancillary to satisfying primary task objectives.  Students completing degrees in this concentration find employment in a variety of enterprises, including emergency management, environmental analysis, and transportation planning.   Degrees in Meteorology and Climatology The major in Meteorology and Climatology appeals to students with primary interests in weather forecasting and/or atmospheric research. This major meets American Meteorological Society (AMS) qualifications for the title “meteorologist,” and Federal Civil Service requirements ("

Mittleman, Chairperson  bsu.edu/psysc 384   Psychology is a science that studies behavior and mental processes. Psychologists study individual differences in personality and cognitive abilities, social and biological influences on behavior, and the effects of development and learning on the individual. The study of psychology can help students understand both their own motivations and the behavior of others.   The department offers a program of study that is intended to serve students with a variety of career goals. Some students seek employment immediately following graduation. Others use the major as preparation for graduate study or for a career as a high school social studies or psychology teacher. In addition to a basic understanding of psychological science in both laboratory and experiential settings, the undergraduate program is designed to promote the development of critical thinking and communication skills, technological and diversity competencies, and personal and professional ethics.   The courses students select within the major should be driven by their educational goals. Whether students intend to pursue employment or graduate study, they should consult with their primary advisor regarding course selection. Their primary advisor may also be helpful in choosing a minor that will further their professional and personal objectives. Students are also assigned a faculty advisor, with whom students should consult for graduate school or career-related questions, issues, or advice. Students interested in teaching psychology at the high school level may complete a social studies major with a concentration in psychology.

Emert, Dean; A. Livingston, Associate Dean  bsu.edu/honors  The Honors College offers distinctive learning opportunities for students with excellent academic promise by way of special courses, colloquia, seminars, and independent study. The curriculum is interdisciplinary in nature, consisting of courses that link issues and themes from a variety of modes of inquiry. Honors professors often invite guest speakers to furnish additional perspectives on topics under study.  Students in the Honors College complete a core of six Honors courses that can also meet requirements in the University Core Curriculum. The core includes inquiries in contemporary American civilization, global studies, science, and a three-term integrated exploration of the major intellectual, artistic, and cultural achievements of humankind. Honors core courses may be taken during any year of study.  All incoming students enroll in the Freshman Seminar in their first semester. This seminar provides an orientation to the Honors College and the university experience, and is guided by an upper-division Honors College student mentor. After the freshman year, students may enroll in Honors colloquia. Each Honors student takes at least two colloquia during their undergraduate studies. These colloquia are developed by Honors faculty members to focus on special topics, creative connections, or critical issues in their areas of expertise. As a senior, each student completes an individual inquiry or creative project under the guidance of a professor selected by the student.  Throughout their four years, Honors students have ready access to their Honors advisor, who helps to identify one’s academic goals and offers continual guidance from freshman orientation through graduation. Honors students may apply for the Undergraduate Fellows competition, which awards stipends for independent work with a faculty mentor. Honors students are strongly encouraged to pursue short- or long-term study abroad experiences and major post-graduate fellowship opportunities. Any undergraduate student may also earn “Departmental Honors” in their major, as determined by the major department and coordinated by the Honors College.  Applications for admission to the Honors College are reviewed by the Honors College following the applicant’s admission to Ball State University. The Honors College considers the strength of the high school curriculum (including the Indiana Academic Honors Diploma or equivalent curriculum and value-added experiences such as AP, IB or other special academic courses), extracurricular activities and leadership experiences, letters of reference from teachers familiar with the student’s potential for college academic work, and standardized test scores. Students admitted to the Honors College must make regular progress in the Honors curriculum: students’ grade-point averages must be at least 3.0 at the end of the freshman year and 3.15 at the end of the sophomore year; students should complete at least one Honors core course by the end of the first year; students should complete at least three Honors core courses by the end of the second year. In order to graduate with an Honors diploma, students must complete the Honors curriculum and finish with a cumulative grade-point average of at least 3.33.   Transfer students are also welcome to request admission to the Honors College. Transfer students should contact the dean of the Honors College directly, preferably by e-mail.  For more information, contact the dean of the Honors College via e-mail (honors@bsu.edu) or phone, 765-285-1024, or explore the Honors College Web site at bsu.edu/honors.

Menning, Chairperson  bsu.edu/sociology  Sociology is the systematic study of human society and social interaction. Sociologists study the effects of groups upon individuals, interactions among groups and organizations, and cultural beliefs that direct human behavior within a local and global context. Sociological research involves collecting information about social processes, which is used to test and develop sociological theories. Through their course work, sociology majors develop practical skills in writing, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, data analysis, and research methods, which are valued and sought after in the job market. In addition to these skills, a degree in sociology provides students with the ability to consider social issues within the context of society as a whole and in relation to complex social systems. Ultimately students leave with the knowledge and skill to influence change in the world. Sociology majors find employment in business, non-profit, human resources, and government organizations. Many students pursue advanced degrees in sociology while others find themselves well prepared for graduate study in urban planning, institutional research, social work, non-profit management, counseling, law, and business.

Luke, Chairperson  bsu.edu/languages  The Department of Modern Languages and Classics is dedicated to the teaching of modern and classical languages, literatures, and cultures as a vital part of the University’s mission. The department strives to develop a learner-centered community that supports fundamental learning as the basis for individual inquiry. In a collaborative environment, our programs focus on providing contexts for transformative experiences, which challenge individuals to develop the judgment needed to act as knowledgeable citizens in times of growing internationalization.        The department provides a vibrant academic learning experience attuned to multidisciplinary inquiry, diversity, global awareness, environmental issues, and a commitment to civic engagement in the local, national, and international communities. The Department of Modern Languages and Classics offers programs in both ancient and modern world languages and works closely with other programs and departments to combine world language training with other disciplines.         Through its extensive programs in languages and cultures of the world, the department offers opportunities for students to enhance oral and written communication skills and technological competencies, learn how to solve problems and collaborate with others, and appreciate diverse cultures through immersive learning opportunities such as service learning and study abroad. The department will continually assess the programs in order to meet the needs of its students and the university.        The faculty is dedicated to pursuing the scholarship of discovery, integration, application, and teaching. They collaborate with their students, other language teachers, experts in other disciplines, and members of the community in the inquiry process. They use the results to advance research in the humanities and social sciences, which, in turn, enhances student learning and can speak to issues both local and global.        Why study world languages? At a practical level, most of the people in the world do not speak English as a native language. One of the main reasons for our students to study world languages is to gain a better knowledge of the multicultural modern world in which we live. Another important reason is enhanced job prospects. Almost every industry today is diversifying linguistically, and having advanced proficiency in another language is one of the greatest assets anyone can have for the current and future job market.        Ball State University supports over 150 study abroad programs, with new programs added every year. There are a variety of types of programs (consortia-based, faculty-led, and direct-enroll programs, along with internships) of different durations (from a week to a year). Approximately 500 Ball State students study abroad every year in over 40 countries on average, including China, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Argentina, Costa Rica, and Spain, among others. Students can also be involved in language clubs (AMG, clubs of each language section, Pokemon Trainers Union, Animation Society, etc.), conversation hours, and two national world language honoraries. Students may earn credit for previous language study through either AP tests or department-run 343  placement exams. For additional information on placement credit and policies, please contact the department directly (765-285-1361). Students should meet frequently with their academic advisor in the department to ensure that courses are taken in sequence and that they are on track to graduate on time.  During either term of the senior year, majors in the department are required to complete a summative assessment. Guidelines will be provided by the department.

The core instills an understanding of the development process, and its demanding analysis of the market, means of financing, and applicable public regulation. The process requires knowledge of site evaluation and control, the formulation and implementation of an architectural program, lease-up or sale, and the management of the asset during its holding period. The process serves the end users or consumers, the public, and the investors. The application is for a variety of land uses and locations, including inner city and infill development, and leads to career roles as an enterprising developer in all three economic sectors: for-profit, nonprofit, and public. The combination of land uses and real estate roles constitute a range of areas of specialized interest that is addressed through electives. Many courses are field-based and present “hands-on” experiences that constitute experiential, service, or immersive learning. Some courses present online Internet distance learning opportunities.

Ferguson, Interim Dean; T. Mahouz, Interim Associate Dean  bsu.edu/cap/  The College of Architecture and Planning (CAP) offers degree programs in architecture, construction management, environmental design (architecture), interior design, landscape architecture, urban planning and development, historic preservation, and urban design. All programs are fully accredited by their respective professional accrediting agencies. Professional graduate degrees in architecture, landscape architecture, and urban and regional planning are also available for students with undergraduate degrees in fields other than design and planning.  Admission Requirements Entry-level students in architecture, landscape architecture and urban planning must complete a supplemental application process and secure admission into CAP’s Common First Year Program. Required courses in the first year provide a foundation in theories and skills pertinent to all three disciplines. For more information about the CAP supplemental admission process, please log on to bsu.edu/admissions.  Those students entering the Interior Design program are not required to submit an application to the College. However, Interior Design students are placed in the Pre-Interior Design program for the first two years. Approval to pursue the Interior Design concentration requires the submission of portfolio during spring semester of sophomore year.   Those students declaring a major in Construction Management are admitted directly into the Construction Management program and are not required to submit an application to the College.   Pre-Declaration Students in good academic standing who wish to pursue a career in landscape architecture or urban planning and development and have completed a minimum of 30 college credits may be admitted directly into these two degree programs by means of a special “Pre-Declaration Entry” track. For more information please contact the dean’s office.  Enrollment Management Plan During their first year, CAP students have opportunities to meet with faculty and professional advisors to discuss career and curriculum options in all of the college’s degree programs.  Each department has instituted an enrollment management plan. In the event that the number of students who declare an interest in one of the majors exceeds one of the departmental enrollment limits, students may not be able to enroll in their preferred major, and may be advised about other available degree programs of the college and the university. That is, admission into the second year at CAP is subject to departmental enrollment review, and established departmental retention standards.  CAP Common First Year Program "

Swartz, Chairperson  bsu.edu/architecture/  Architectural education attends to the critical 21st century environmental and social challenges in our communities while educating students in analytical and creative thinking, intellectual inquiry, ideation, hands-on making, and communication. We seek to inspire our students with the grounding of a rigorous education that fosters the creative and intellectual confidence, ethical grounding, and self-awareness to allow them to succeed in their disciplinary aspirations in a rapidly changing world. Three undergraduate degree programs in architecture are offered.  Each of these is tailored to different student educational pursuits and professional aspirations.    The five-year Bachelor of Architecture program provides a professionally oriented undergraduate education resulting in an accredited professional degree (a necessary requirement for professional licensure). The B.Arch degree balances the intensity of a professional degree program with a broader, well rounded, and diverse undergraduate university education.  This B.Arch degree program also provides a foundation for other career paths and/or educational pursuits at the graduate level. This degree program is 60  currently eligible for initial candidacy and accreditation by the National Architectural Accrediting Board.  The university expects to host a visit for initial accreditation in Fall 2020.  See * below.  The four-year undergraduate degree program Bachelor of Arts (includes a foreign language concentration) or Bachelor of Science (no foreign language concentration) with a major in architecture provide a “pre-professional” undergraduate architecture education.  This degree path prepares students to pursue a graduate professional M.Arch degree in architecture (a necessary requirement for professional licensure). This degree is the pre-professional component of the department’s NAAB accredited Master of Architecture degree.  Note that the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited professional degree. See ** below.  The four-year undergraduate major BS in Environmental Design provides students with an immersive exposure to the discipline of architecture, while preparing them for leadership roles in allied environmental design disciplines.  While benefitting from lessons in critical thinking, communication and design process inherent in an architectural education, this degree suits students who have broader educational and career aspirations, perhaps leading to careers (with or without additional graduate education) in the construction industry, interior design, industrial design, business management, communications, marketing, or business, to name a few.  This degree does not directly lead to professional licensure as an architect although the three-year professional Master of Architecture program would be an option for students in this track.  Approval to pursue any of the departmental undergraduate degrees involves admission to the university http://cms.bsu.edu/admissions/undergraduate-admissions/information-for/high-school-students and acceptance into the College of Architecture and Planning http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/cap/applications-financial-aid/undergraduate AND admission into the Department of Architecture Department after the first year at CAP.   Admission Standards: 1. Portfolio of CAP first year work including design, design communication media work and writing examples (reviewed by committee for admission) 2. A minimum cumulative GPA of 2.75 overall in the CAP first-year courses Note:  transfer requests into the undergraduate program are addressed on a case-by-case basis.

ARCH 218,", 318 etc.), must repeat the sequence of both courses.  In the United States, most registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit professional degree programs in architecture offered by institutions with U.S. regional accreditation, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted an eight-year, three-year, or two-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.   Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may require a pre-professional undergraduate degree in architecture for admission. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.  The NAAB grants candidacy status to new programs that have developed viable plans for achieving initial accreditation.  Candidacy status indicates that a program expects to achieve initial accreditation within six years of achieving candidacy, if its plan is properly implemented.  In order to meet the education requirement set forth by the National Council of Architectural Registration Boards, an applicant for an NCARB Certificate must hold a professional degree in architecture from a program accredited by the NAAB; the degree must have been awarded not more than two years prior to initial accreditation.  However, meeting the education requirement for the NCARB Certificate may not be equivalent to meeting the education requirement for registration in a specific jurisdiction.  Please contact NCARB for more information.   * Ball State University, Department of Architecture, is eligible for candidacy for accreditation of the following NAAB-accredited degree program: B.Arch.

SPEECH PATHOLOGY AND AUDIOLOGY  M. J. Germani, Chairperson bsu.edu/spaa  Speech-language pathologists provide diagnostic services and therapy to people with speech or language problems. Audiologists provide diagnostic and rehabilitative services to people with hearing and balance problems. Speech-language pathologists and audiologists work in medical settings, schools, private practice, community and university clinics, long-term care facilities, and industrial settings. The Department of Speech Pathology and Audiology's graduate programs are accredited by the Council on Academic Accreditation (CAA) in Audiology and Speech-Language Pathology of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA). To become licensed, certified speech-language pathologists, students must complete both a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. To become licensed, certified audiologists, students must complete both a bachelor's degree and a doctorate degree. As part of their work, students acquire extensive clinical practicum experience working with patients who have speech, language, and hearing problems. At the undergraduate level, the department offers preprofessional undergraduate majors in speech-language pathology and preaudiology. The majors, combined with an appropriate graduate program, lead to a state professional license, national certification, and school licensure. Admission to the clinical portion of the major is selective. Students should obtain a copy of the department's “Undergraduate Major Admission and Progression Policies” from the department office, Arts and Communications 254  Building, Room 104. For information on the department's Master of Arts (MA) in Speech-Language Pathology and Doctor of Audiology (AuD) degree, see the Ball State University Graduate Catalog. The department operates the Ball State University Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Clinics as campus facilities where students can participate in their initial practicum experiences under the supervision of the department's faculty.   MAJOR IN PREAUDIOLOGY (BA/BS), 65-66 credits   Admission requirements  Completion of the major in preaudiology preparation does not guarantee admission to any Ball State post-baccalaureate program in audiology, nor to other graduate or professional audiology programs.

BA or BS degree students are only required to submit portfolios for course evaluation. Applications and portfolios for BFA degree program consideration can be submitted to meet the deadlines for first-time freshmen or currently enrolled students.   Transfer students specializing in any program must complete the first-year foundation core courses (, 202) before being admitted to areas of concentrations in the second year of study. For BFA students wanting a concentration in animation or visual communication, it is unusual for students to be admitted at any point other than at the beginning of the three-year sequence of courses.  Course Evaluation for Transfer Students. In addition to submitting a portfolio for admission to the School of Art, transfer students from other universities are required to submit a portfolio of artwork and course syllabi to determine art program credit. We recommend transfer students keep course syllabi, project descriptions, and sketchbooks; preserve artwork or projects from each course (actual work or digital images); bring all materials for any review process; and to follow through with any part of the course evaluation process that was not completed at the first meeting. Students specializing in any art program must receive grades of C or higher in all first-year foundation core courses (, 202) before enrolling in advanced level courses. Students must repeat courses in which they receive grades of C- or below. Students that meet the grade requirement then select an area of concentration for the second through fourth years of study. Concentrations involve a three-year sequence of courses beyond the first-year foundation core.   Animation (BFA degree) – Students wanting to pursue this major concentration must undergo an additional review after successful completion of the foundation core (, 202). Review guidelines are revised periodically and made available through the School of Art.   Visual Communication (BFA degree) – Students wanting to pursue this major concentration must undergo an additional review after successful completion of the foundation core (, 202). Review guidelines are revised periodically and made available through the School of Art.   Visual Arts Education (BA/BS degree) – Students wanting to pursue a teaching major must meet all teacher certification and GPA requirements. An art portfolio is not required unless applying for art scholarships. Students are encouraged to meet with a faculty advisor.  All students in the school undergo periodic reviews of their portfolios throughout their undergraduate education. The school reserves the right to retain digital copies of student work for exhibition and accreditation. All concentrations require a senior thesis and/or an exit portfolio evaluation, presentation or exhibition.  Students are strongly advised to pursue required course sequences during the regular academic year. Summer school courses are limited and are subject to last minute changes or cancellations.  All students may enroll in art history courses based on the completion of the prerequisites. Minors in art history are not required to submit an art application but must receive approval from the School of Art. Minors may begin art courses in the spring or summer term.  In accordance with the School of Art’s selective admission process all studio courses (ACR, ADS, AFA, ART) are open only to art majors except by permission of the director of the school. Art History (AHS) courses are open to non-majors as are a small number of studio courses. Ball State University is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design.

Horowitz, Chairperson  bsu.edu/economics Economics studies how markets coordinate the activities of people and societies as they make the best use of scarce resources.  Economics provides a framework to analyze a wide variety of issues in business, society and politics. For example, economists study everything from business, politics, health, education, poverty, and the environment. Economics majors excel in careers in business, government, law, and education.  The Department of Economics offers courses in a variety of topics including microeconomics, macroeconomics, money and banking, public finance, labor economics, health economics, international economics, economic development, game theory, and econometrics. Economics majors often double major in related fields such as accounting, actuarial science, finance, management, marketing, mathematics, and political science. For information on the many careers available to economics majors and minors, go to the departmental Web site.  Students majoring in economics may choose from three concentrations and an interdepartmental major in mathematical economics.   89  1) Business concentration: Designed for students planning careers in business especially in accounting, finance, management, and marketing. This option requires completion of the core business classes and students can choose from a wide variety of economics classes.   2) Financial analyst concentration: Designed for students planning careers in financial portfolio management. The Department of Economics is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) recognized department. This option requires completion of the core business classes and students specialize in classes on money and banking and finance.   3) Liberal arts concentration:  Students in this concentration have three options 1) general economics, 2) law and economics and 3) financial economics. This concentration does not require completion of the core business classes and students can choose from a wide variety of economics classes based on the option they choose.    4) Mathematical economics: This interdepartmental major is offered in conjunction with the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Mathematical economics prepares students for careers as economic analysts and for graduate work in economics or related fields. A mathematical economics major also facilitates a double major in either mathematical economics and actuarial science or mathematical economics and mathematical sciences (See Interdepartmental Programs p. 55).  Minors in economics are available to majors in the Miller College of Business and all other majors throughout the University. Students in the Social Studies Teaching Major may also select economics as a licensing area.

Kandiah, Chairperson  bsu.edu/nutritionandhealth  The Department of Nutrition and Health Science offers a variety of programs in allied health science, basic science, health promotion, and disease prevention. Program emphases include dietetics, health education and promotion, school health education (leading to grades 7-12 certification), public health, radiography, and respiratory therapy. The latter two programs are offered in cooperation with IU Health in Indianapolis. Interested students should contact the Department of Nutrition and Health Science or visit https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/nutrition-and-health-science/academic-programs to obtain a copy of the desired admission and retention policy and plan of study. In addition, the department houses the national office of Eta Sigma Gamma, the health education honorary.  ASSOCIATE DEGREE The Associate degree program prepares students for careers in radiography. Radiographers are highly skilled professionals qualified by education to perform x-ray procedures to assist in diagnosing and treating medical conditions. The prerequisite phase of the program takes place on the Ball State campus. The professional concentration phase is offered in Indianapolis, where medical, technical, and clinical courses are taught at IU Health Methodist Hospital and other clinical education sites. There are specific admission and retention requirements for the radiography program. Interested students should contact the Department of Nutrition and Health Science for more information.  General Information  Students may complete the required radiography prerequisite courses upon admission to the university. Admission to the professional concentration phase requires a separate application and is competitive. Admission to the university, satisfactory completion of the radiography prerequisite courses and fulfillment of program admission requirements does not guarantee admission to the professional concentration phase of the program. The radiography program designates the number of students admitted to the professional concentration phase each year.  Applicants to the professional concentration phase must disclose any termination from a health care facility, ticket, citation, summons, arrest, charge, or conviction for a misdemeanor or felony. Individuals who have been charged or convicted of a misdemeanor or felony must preapply and receive clearance from the national certifying body by the professional concentration program application deadline.  All accepted students to the professional concentration phase of the program must provide documentation of CPR and required immunization/tests and successfully complete a background check and mandatory drug testing performed by IU Health.  238   In order to participate in the professional concentration phase of the program, no accepted student may appear on specific Federal exclusion lists.  BACHELOR’S DEGREES Two of the bachelor degree programs prepare students for careers as health educators. The major in health education and promotion prepares students to serve as health educators in community health settings that include, but are not limited to, governmental health agencies, community health agencies, clinical health settings, and in businesses and industries. In addition to the course work required in this major, students must also complete a semester-long internship.  The teaching major in health and physical education prepares students to serve as health and physical educators in middle and high school settings. In addition to the course work required in the major, students must complete the professional education course sequence and teacher education requirements, including a student teaching experience.  The third bachelor degree program prepares students for careers in respiratory therapy. Respiratory therapists help diagnose, treat, rehabilitate, and educate to prevent and manage cardiopulmonary diseases. They are skilled in airway maintenance, procurement and analysis of arterial blood gas samples, and performance of pulmonary function tests. Students may enter the general studies portion of the program upon admission to the university; however, admission to the program is competitive, and admission to the university does not guarantee acceptance to the professional studies/clinical phase of the program. The professional studies courses are taught at IU Health in Indianapolis. Students may apply for admission to the professional studies/clinical portion of this program when the following requirements are met: 28 credits of the required courses are completed; 10 of these completed credits are in the required math/science courses; all math/science courses must be completed with a grade of C or higher; 2.5 overall GPA; completion and documentation of at least three credits of clinical observation. Accepted students must provide documentation of CPR and required immunizations/tests. Once accepted, each must successfully complete a background check and mandatory drug testing performed by IU Health. Accepted students must not appear on specific Federal exclusion lists. Failing any of these requirements would make the applicant ineligible for the professional studies portion of the program.  Dietetics/Pre-Dietetics (four-year program). The Didactic Program in Dietetics prepares students for careers that maximize health through nutrition. The program provides academic preparation for a career as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN). An RDN provides nutrition care in many settings, such as medical centers, community health programs, schools, athletic teams, and may also work in the foodservice or pharmaceutical industries. The program is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Graduates of the program are required to complete an ACEND-accredited Dietetic Internship post-graduation, and prior to the Registration Examination for Dietitians.

Wies, Chairperson  bsu.edu/anthropology  As the study of humankind, anthropology is part of the social sciences at Ball State University. It draws upon theory, methodology, and data from the humanities and biological sciences as well. Cultural anthropology is concerned with the ways people organize themselves socially in different types of groups. Archaeology is concerned with how human culture has evolved and changed through time. Biological anthropology examines the evolution and adaptation of the species, and explores variations among past and present living populations, the biological bases of human behavior, and primate studies. Linguistics, which is taught in the Ball State University Department of English, is concerned with the nature and history of language and its role in human culture. The department offers cultural field trips in the United States and cultural field schools abroad, prehistoric and historic archaeological field schools, educational opportunities through Ball State’s Applied Anthropology Laboratory, and internship opportunities. 266   The anthropology major offers a core program designed to develop a foundation in anthropology and four specialized concentrations. Concentration 1 is intended for majors interested in a general degree in anthropology that covers cultural anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology. Concentration 2 is intended for majors specializing in archaeology including those who will continue their studies in a graduate program or who intend to pursue careers in cultural resource management. Concentration 3 is intended for majors who are interested in applied work in cultural anthropology. Concentration 4 is intended for majors who are interested in biological application within anthropology such as forensics and medical anthropology. All four concentrations prepare students for graduate studies. A concentration for department honors is also available. The department also offers a minor in anthropology.

Badger, Chairperson  bsu.edu/biology  The Department of Biology offers programs for students preparing for careers in science teaching, laboratory biology, environmental biology, and health professions such as medicine, medical technology, and dentistry.  The laboratory sciences of cellular and molecular biology, genetics, and microbiology offer in-depth opportunities for students pursuing bioscience positions in medicine, government, academia, and industry. Experiences with the modern tools of biotechnology are a central theme for all laboratory biology concentrations and the department offers a biotechnology certification program. Biologists in environmental careers work to maintain the natural world for future generations. The department’s conservation biology programs focus on preparing students for careers related to the conservation of plant and animal biodiversity and the science supporting the sustainable management of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Further information about careers for biology majors can be found on our departmental Web site bsu.edu/biology. The biology major offers a core program intended to develop a common background in biology and additional courses in specialized concentrations designed to prepare students for careers or graduate work in aquatic biology and fisheries, field botany, cellular and molecular biology, environmental biology, genetics, microbiology, wildlife biology and conservation, and zoology. Our general biology concentration allows students to pursue an individualized program for their specific career goals as a biologist. Pre-professional majors add selected courses to meet entrance requirements into medical, dental, and medical technology schools. A teaching major in life science is offered for students who plan to teach in the secondary schools. (Additional course requirements for science teaching programs appear in this catalog under Interdepartmental Programs in the College of Sciences and Humanities.) It is strongly recommended that students seek departmental advising, on an individual basis, early in their programs to plan course work sequences and obtain specific information about their selected emphasis areas and possible certification.

Some medical schools also require general psychology and sociology. Because admission to a medical school is not guaranteed (only 45 percent of applicants nationwide are admitted to medical schools), each pre-med student should complete another major in any subject. The following courses are recommended for elective credit in the first three years: mathematics;  Struct and Dev of Vertebrates 5    –––––    55-59 crs  PREPHARMACY PROGRAM  The prepharmacy program is designed for students who want to apply for admission to the Butler University College of Pharmacy or the Purdue University School of Pharmacy. When completed satisfactorily, the designated courses will 276  meet the preprofessional curricular requirements of Purdue and Butler at the end of the second year. At both Purdue and Butler the combined prepharmacy-pharmacy program leading to the Doctor of Pharmacy requires six years. However, the number of applicants to any college of pharmacy exceeds the capacity of the school. Therefore, students are selected for admission into the prepharmacy and pharmacy programs at these schools based on considerations such as scholastic standing, character, and professional aptitude. Students should become familiar with the admission requirements stated in the bulletins of Butler and Purdue Universities. Careful arrangement of the program for each year is essential so that courses may be completed in sequence and in the allotted time. In particular, general chemistry should be completed in the freshman year. Mathematics, including calculus, is highly desirable. Copies of the programs are available from the pre-pharmacy advisor located in the biology department. There are minor differences in requirements between the School of Pharmacy at Purdue and the College of Pharmacy at Butler. The prepharmacy programs do not lead to graduation from Ball State University. They merely supply students with an approved sequence of courses for the first two years of the complete six-year program. Furthermore, physical education is not a part of this program for students who hope to transfer to Purdue, but it is for those who hope to go to Butler. Students who drop out of the prepharmacy program and elect to follow degree programs of Ball State University will be expected to meet all Ball State degree requirements.  Prepharmacy counseling is available in the Department of Biology.  PREVETERINARY—PREOPTOMETRY—PREPHYSICIAN’S ASSISTANT—PRECHIROPRACTIC  Courses are offered that fulfill requirements for those students who are planning to apply for admission to schools of veterinary medicine, optometry, physician’s assistant, and prechiropractic. Preprofessional counseling for these programs is available in the Department of Biology.  MINOR IN BIOLOGY, 19-20 credits  PREFIX NO SHORT TITLE CREDITS  Students planning to minor in biology should choose 200-level courses which fulfill prerequisites for 300- and 400-level courses in the minor. The 300- and 400-level courses should be chosen from the concentrations listed for biology majors.  "

MAJOR IN MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY  This program leads to a bachelor of science degree with a major in medical technology. The medical technologist is prepared for such laboratory work as bacteriology, chemistry, serology, and blood bank technology in hospital laboratories, physicians’ and surgeons’ clinics, and federal, state, and municipal health laboratories as well as research laboratories and commercial companies making biological products. The departmental major in medical technology and the University Core Curriculum requirements and elective courses, all of which must total at least 88 credits, are to be completed in the first three years of study. The fourth or senior year consists of a twelve-month clinical laboratory program in an accredited hospital school of medical technology. Thirty-two credits are granted for the successful completion of this year. The minimum total for the degree is 120 credits. Admission to a school of medical technology is determined entirely by the school applied to and is based on such considerations as scholastic standing (e.g., minimum grade-point average of 2.5), personal interviews, and recommendations. Completion of the first three years does not guarantee admission to the clinical year; students are therefore advised to plan an alternative program that may be completed in the fourth year. Students may then reapply for the clinical year. The university has established affiliations for preparation of medical technologists with the following Indiana hospitals: Saint Francis Hospital in Beech Grove, Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne, IU Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Good Samaritan Hospital in Vincennes, and St. Margaret Mercy Health Care Centers in Hammond. We are also affiliated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Tennessee.

To qualify for admission to the Indiana University School of Dentistry at the close of three years of predental preparation, students must complete the major and specific course and scholastic requirements of the curriculum with a minimum of 92 credits at Ball State University. If accepted into dental school, they will use the credit earned the first year in the Indiana University School of Dentistry (28 275  credits) to meet the senior year course requirements for the baccalaureate degree from Ball State. In addition to the basic science requirements, students entering the Indiana University School of Dentistry will be required to have 20 credits of Biology for majors; 15 credits of Chemistry including general, organic and biochemistry; 8 credits of general Physics; 3 credits of Social Sciences; and 3 credits of Humanities.

Buis, Chairperson  bsu.edu/cs  Computer science is the study of information and computation and their application in computer systems. Computer science majors start by learning the fundamentals of programming, algorithms, and discrete mathematics, while upper-level courses focus on specializations such as software engineering, programming languages, theory, web and mobile platform development, operating systems, networking, and databases. The ubiquitous application of computer science necessitates that majors be broadly educated and have excellent analytical and communication skills.  The department also offers two minors:  The computer science minor allows students with other majors to learn the foundations of traditional computer science.  The computer security minor explores modern issues in computer and information security such as digital forensics and encryption.  Computer Science majors taking classes at the 200-level and above will be required to own a laptop computer and may be expected to bring the laptop to such classes. Computer ownership for students in 100-level courses is encouraged but not required. Some classes will require running software under Windows, but a MacIntosh with Parallels will work well for such software.

Karls, Chairperson  bsu.edu/math  By focusing on strong analytical and quantitative skills, the mathematical sciences programs prepare students for professional positions in a variety of areas. The department offers majors in actuarial science, mathematical sciences, and mathematics teaching. In conjunction with the Department of Economics, the department offers a major in mathematical economics. For information on the major in mathematical economics, see Interdepartmental Programs, p. 54. The department minor in mathematics is open only to non-333  departmental majors. The minor in foundations of business for actuarial science and mathematics majors is open only to departmental majors.   The major in actuarial science provides students with the mathematics and business education necessary to enter the actuarial profession and prepares students for the professional actuarial exams. Actuaries apply the theory of probability and statistics along with the principles of finance to analyze and solve problems in insurance, pension plans, social security issues, and related fields. The mathematics teaching major satisfies state licensure requirements for students preparing to teach mathematics in junior high/middle school and high school. Concentrations for this major are middle school and secondary school. Elementary education majors may choose mathematics as their area of concentration. Elementary education majors may also earn additional licensure to teach mathematics in junior high/middle school. The mathematical sciences major offers students concentrations for specialization in two areas: mathematics and applied mathematics. These programs prepare students for professional positions in business, industry, and government, as well as graduate work in mathematics or related fields, including engineering, law, or medicine. Students wishing to declare two majors within the Department of Mathematical Sciences may do so provided they have at least 20 semester credits that are counted toward the second major not also being used as credit toward the first major.   Unless otherwise noted, all students enrolling in courses in the Department of Mathematical Sciences are expected to have completed at least three years of college preparatory mathematics in high school, including two years of algebra and one year of geometry. To begin all programs (except for the concentration in mathematics for elementary education majors), it is expected that students will have completed high school mathematics courses equivalent to the prerequisite for  or "

Bryan, Chairperson  bsu.edu/physics  Physics Major Concentrations, Physics Teaching, Pre-Engineering Preparation, Astronomy and Minors in Physics, Applied Physics, Astrophysics and Introductory Astronomy The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers two concentrations for majors in physics, a major in physics teaching, pre-engineering preparation, and astronomy as well as several programs for minors in astronomy and/or physics. For majors, the general physics concentration is a course of study for those students who intend to pursue graduate work or industrial careers in physics, astronomy, or engineering. The applied physics concentration is for those students who are primarily interested in careers in industry. Minors are available in physics, applied physics in electronics, applied physics in nanoscience, astrophysics, and introductory astronomy, and are designed for those students who have an interest in those fields but have a major in another area.  Pre-Engineering Major The pre-engineering major is generally a five-year program in which students attend Ball State for three years and then transfer to an engineering school to complete requirements for their engineering degree. Upon successful completion of the engineering program, a student is eligible to receive a bachelor’s degree from Ball State in addition to the engineering degree from the other institution. Students in this program are responsible for knowing and meeting the graduation requirements of both Ball State and the school to which they transfer. Admission to Ball State as a pre-engineering major does not guarantee admission to an accredited school of engineering. Electives in the program permit tailoring the program for the wide variety of engineering specialties.  Astronomy Major The Department of Physics and Astronomy offers a new major in astronomy as well as minors in astrophysics and introductory astronomy. For majors, astronomy gives students many of the same skills as a physicist plus skills like digital image processing, remote sensing and applied spectral analysis. People with a bachelor’s degree in astronomy are qualified for jobs in observatories, 370  planetariums, national laboratories, and the aerospace industry. This degree also prepares a person for graduate study in astronomy, physics, and related fields.  Physics Teaching Major The Physics Teaching Major is a four-year accredited program that meets the requirements for students to obtain an undergraduate degree with an Indiana secondary physics teaching license. Students in this degree program receive a strong foundation in physics content knowledge, along with courses in educational foundations, educational psychology, multicultural education, secondary education, and science education pedagogy. Students may use this degree and license to teach high school physics and middle school science, but additional science courses are recommended for students who wish to teach middle school science.

Wheeler, Chairperson  bsu.edu/poli-sci  The world and its problems are both the main concern and the principal laboratory of the modern political scientist. Political scientists study the political behavior of people, groups, and nations in an effort to understand why they behave as they do, to predict what they will do next, and sometimes to suggest how they should behave in the future. Students majoring in political science have three areas for course concentration: political science (general), economics, and international studies.  In addition, students interested in attending law school may declare a pre-law designation and be advised of the selected courses needed to meet entrance requirements into law school. For information on the major in legal studies (an American Bar Association approved paralegal program) and on the European studies minor, which are housed in the department, see the listing for Interdepartmental Programs, p. 35, or contact the Political Science department at 765-285-8780.

TEACHER LICENSING   The Ball State University programs for the preparation of teachers and other public school personnel meet the standards of the Rules for Educator Preparation and Accountability (REPA), the policies of the Office of Educator Effectiveness and Licensing (OEEL) and the Indiana Department of Education.  The teacher education programs meet the academic requirements for the initial teaching license. These programs are also accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) and the Higher Learning Commission, providing added benefits to students and graduates in terms of transfer of credit, recognition of degrees, and reciprocity of teacher licenses. Under the Licensure Framework of OEEL the teaching license will reflect the standards for which the candidate has demonstrated competency through the completion of a degree program. The license will state (1) the content area(s) that the candidate is licensed to teach and (2) the school setting(s) in which the candidate is licensed to teach.   APPLICATION FOR TEACHING LICENSE  Any teaching assignment as a professional teacher in a state-approved school requires a teaching license based upon the recommendation of the teacher preparation institution, except for testing additions. An institutional recommendation is based upon meeting the REPA standards, OEEL policies required for the licensure program, and successful performance on all required assessments in the Ball State Unit Assessment System. Details regarding the REPA standards and assessments for specific licensure areas may be found by consulting the Professional Education Handbook (www.bsu.edu/teachers/tehandbook) and the OTES-CP website(http://cms.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/teachers/currentstudents/otes/testrequirements).  Students should apply for the Indiana instructional license through the Indiana Department of Education’s Licensing Verification and Information System (LVIS) no earlier than the completion of all academic requirements and always after the completion of all licensing examinations. According to state statute, candidates for licensure must provide evidence of current (through state approved agencies) CPR/AED certification and documentation that they have completed suicide prevention training (through state approved agencies) prior to license recommendation. Applicants for teacher licensing in other states requiring the recommendation of Ball State University must also submit such applications to the Office of Teacher Education Services and Clinical Practice. The Initial Practitioner license issued by the  OEEL is valid for two years in Indiana. The beginning teacher must successfully complete the Indiana Residency Program (formerly IMAP) or 40 professional growth points (PGPs) after verifying two years of full-time teaching experience.  At that time, a Proficient Practitioner license is awarded, which is valid for five years. Renewal of the Proficient Practitioner license and awarding of the Accomplished Practitioner license is achieved through a program of continuing professional development based on the OEEL standards or six hours of course work at Ball State University.  To be recommended for renewal by Ball State University 395  throughcoursework, one must have completed at least half of their renewal credits at Ball State.  A person who has earned a bachelor’s degree and who wants to complete requirements for an Indiana teaching license or add a teaching area to a license must be evaluated and advised for admission to a postgraduate program by the Office of Teacher Education Services and Clinical Practice. A student holding a bachelor’s degree from an accredited Indiana institution other than Ball State, who wants to be recommended for a teaching license by Ball State University, must be admitted as a regular graduate or postgraduate licensing ONLY student and must meet the requirements of the approved university teacher education program.  SCHOOL SERVICES INITIAL PRACTITIONER LICENSE  School Counselor Upon completion of a bachelor’s degree, persons interested in pursuing school counselor licenses must apply to the Graduate School to be admitted to graduate study. After being admitted to graduate study, an application must be made to the Department of Counseling Psychology and Guidance Services to pursue the master’s degree in Counseling (School Concentration). Completion of this master’s degree, and passing the appropriate Pearson content exam, allows for the recommendation for a school counselor’s license. According to state statute, candidates for licensure must provide evidence of current CPR/AED certification (through state approved agencies) and documentation that they have completed suicide prevention training (through state approved agencies) prior to license recommendation.  School Psychologist This license will require a minimum of 70 graduate semester hours in School Psychology or a related field. The school psychologist license will state P-12 under school settings, since the standards ensure that the school psychologist will be well versed in curriculum, pedagogy, and student characteristics of all development levels. According to state statute, candidates for licensure must provide evidence of current CPR/AED (through state approved agencies) certification documentation that they have completed suicide prevention training (through state approved agencies) prior to license recommendation.  PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION ASSESSMENT/DECISION POINTS  Grade points will be checked at the end of each semester beginning when students earn 30 credits. An overall grade-point average of at least 3.0 is required for admission to teacher candidacy (at the end of DP1) and continuation in all educator preparation programs. Decision Point 1:  Admission to Teacher Candidacy  For admission to teacher candidacy and to register in designated 300-level and above professional education courses, students must have:    earned grades of C or better in designated 100- and 200-level professional education courses, including an introductory professional education course, and "

EDUCATIONAL FIELD EXPERIENCES   PRE-STUDENT TEACHING EDUCATIONAL FIELD EXPERIENCES  The purpose of pre-student teaching field experiences is to give students pursuing teacher education an intentional, systematic, planned sequence of experiences in appropriate educational settings. These experiences are designed to familiarize students with principles of classroom management and the teaching-learning process in practical and real school environments and to help them learn how to teach. The pre-student teaching field experiences culminate in "
SPCE 361,", or departmental equivalents which require assignment to classrooms in appropriate educational settings for the semester to observe, prepare instructional presentations, and undertake other instructional tasks appropriate for students before student teaching. The university provides laboratory settings for pre-student teaching educational field experiences in the on-campus Burris Laboratory School as well as in public school partners in Muncie and others within commuting distance.   STUDENT TEACHING  Student teaching in Indiana gives candidates an opportunity to develop teaching competence under the supervision of professionally licensed mentor teachers collaborating with the university in the student teaching program. 402  Performance in student teaching is assessed using a performance assessment instrument completed by the mentor teacher in collaboration with the University supervisor. The final grade in student teaching is recorded as credit/no credit.  Application for Student Teaching Students should apply for student teaching during the academic year before they plan to student teach. Contact the Office of Teacher Education Services and Clinical Practice for additional information.  Official notification of the student teaching assignment will be emailed to the student. In addition, students can view their placement status in Tk-20 at any time. Final eligibility is determined after final grades are posted just prior to student teaching.  General Considerations Students must be free of outside commitments that might interfere with full-time student teaching obligations. Students should not be regularly employed, nor should they carry heavy loads of extracurricular activities. Enrollment for course overload during the semester is permitted only with approval of the Director of the Office of Teacher Education Services and Clincial Practice. Student teaching requirements also include a set number of days in seminars conducted by the university supervisor at the beginning and end of the semester. Students are intentionally placed at a reasonable commuting distance with a preapproved mentor teacher within our Clinical Practice Network. Final determination of the student's assignment will rest with the Office of Teacher Education Services and Clinical practice. The placement process requires close partnership with our Professional Development Schools, Partner Schools, and affiliate schools. All candidates pursuing licensure as teachers are required to spend 16 weeks in full-time student teaching. They must register for 12 credits in student teaching. The only exception is a candidate who is double majoring in Elementary Education and Early Childhood Education. All candidates pursuing these double majors are required to spend 18 credits/24 weeks in student teaching across two semesters. They must register for 12 credits in one semester (fall or spring = 16 weeks ) and then 6 credits in another semester (fall, spring, or summer = 8 weeks).    EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP  F. English, Chairperson  bsu.edu/edleadership  Programs in educational leadership, which are offered only at the graduate level, are designed to prepare students for positions as school superintendents, principals, business managers, directors of buildings and grounds, personnel directors, information officers, and adult and community education directors.

Peo, Assistant Principal  bsu.edu/burris  Burris Laboratory School was established in 1929, as part of Teachers College, Ball State University and the Muncie Schools. In 1990, Burris, with the addition of the Indiana Academy of Science, Mathematics, and Humanities became part of University Schools.   Burris Laboratory School is named after Dr. Benjamin Burris, Dean of Teachers College, Ball State University at the time of the construction of the school. This building, which underwent an 11.7 million dollar renovation in 1993, has always been the home of Burris Laboratory School. The renovation not only improved the appearance of the inside of the building but also up-graded the facilities to include four computer labs, a distance learning studio and well equipped science laboratories.  Burris Laboratory School’s mission is to foster a culture of respect and trust where every student is challenged to pursue excellence by engaging in a well-rounded, technologically-enhanced, rigorous curriculum in a safe and secure environment. As a model school, engaged in best-practice research and the preparation of highly effective educators, we collaborate with community partners to prepare students for success in an ever-changing world.  Burris is fully accredited by AdvancED and the State of Indiana. Burris does not have a school board; therefore, the Ball State University Board of Trustees is the ultimate authority for school policies.
