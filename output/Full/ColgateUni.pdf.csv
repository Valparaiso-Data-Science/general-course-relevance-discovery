CORE 151," Legacies of the Ancient World Director Marlowe This course explores ancient texts that articulate perennial issues, such as the nature of the human and the divine; virtue and the good life; the true, the just, and the beautiful; the difference between subjective opinion and objective knowledge. These texts exemplify basic modes of speech, literary forms, and patterns of thinking that establish the terminology of academic and intellectual discourse and critical thought across many different societies: epic, rhetoric, tragedy, poetry, epistemology, science, democracy, rationality, the soul, spirit, law, grace. Such terms have shaped the patterns of life, norms, and prejudices that human communities have continually challenged, criticized, and refashioned throughout history. To highlight both the dialogue and conflicts between the texts and the traditions they embody, this course, taught by a multidisciplinary staff and in an interdisciplinary manner, focuses on both the historical contexts of these texts and the ongoing retellings and reinterpretations of them through time. The course includes texts from the ancient Mediterranean world that have given rise to some of the philosophical, political, religious, and artistic traditions associated with "The West," emphasizing that Western traditions were not formed in a vacuum but developed in dialogue and conflict with other traditions. Common to all sections of this component are classic works such as Homer, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, Plato, and a Roman text. Complementary texts or visual materials from the ancient period, in and beyond the Western world, and/or response texts from the medieval or contemporary periods are added by faculty in individual sections.  - Legacies of the Ancient World  /152 readings, these books are about human nature and what it means to be human.

CORE 152," Challenges of Modernity Director Bouk Modernity is a crucial element of the intellectual legacy to which we are heirs. A matrix of intellectual, social, and material forces that have transformed the world over the last quarter millennium, modernity has introduced new problems and possibilities into human life. Within modernity, issues of meaning, identity, and morality have been critiqued in distinctive ways. People of different social classes, racial groups, ethnic backgrounds, genders and sexual identities have contributed to an increasingly rich public discourse. The human psyche has been problematized, and the dynamic character of the world, both natural and social, has been explored. Urbanization and technological development have transformed the patterns of everyday life. Imperialism has had a complex and lasting impact on the entire globe. The human capability to ameliorate social and physical ills has increased exponentially, and yet so has the human capacity for mass destruction and exploitation. In this course, taught by an interdisciplinary staff, students explore texts from a variety of media that engage with the ideas and phenomena central to modernity.

This component of the Core Curriculum encourages students to think broadly and critically about the world that they inhabit, asking them to see their contemporary concerns in the perspective of the long-standing discourses of modernity. Communities and Identities Director Kaimal Courses in the Communities and Identities (CI) component are designed to provide a textured understanding of identities, cultures, and human experiences in particular communities and regions of the world. They seek to examine critically the multiple forms of social life that contribute to the world's cultural diversity, and to analyze the ways in which any one society functions as a unified whole and yet encompasses multiple, sometimes conflicting identities (based, for example, on gender, race, status, class, sexual identities, religion, and language). As investigations into a particular place and its extensions, they consider cultures and communities in their own right, with their own practices, histories, beliefs, and values, their own instantiations of modernity, and lastly, with their own capacities to produce and shape complex identities. Furthermore, because many of the societies that are the subject of study have had significant and enduring encounters with imperial powers or other forms of domination, these courses examine the tensions and permutations, asymmetries and alliances that such relationships have produced. Multidisciplinary in focus and materials, these courses explore the complex identities of persons through study of their geography, history, politics, and economics as well as their languages, literature, film, art, music, and religions. Students develop a comparative, historical frame of reference between the community being studied and the communities to which they belong. Scientific Perspectives on the World Director Meyers All people routinely face important decisions about their own lives and about issues of broader social significance that require scientific literacy. In order to make thoughtful decisions about such matters, it is necessary to have a solid understanding of how scientific knowledge is obtained and an appreciation for the complexities of applying scientific findings to broader issues. The courses in the Scientific Perspectives (SP) program are designed to address both of these needs, and are unified by two common purposes. First, these courses deepen students' understanding of the methods used in scientific fields to acquire knowledge about the world. Each of the SP courses focuses on an area of scientific research to give students grounding in the interplay of scientific analysis, verification, and explanation. Second, the SP courses broaden students' understanding of the relevance of scientific methods by helping students to apply scientific methods and findings to a broad range of issues. Specifically, these courses help students to connect their growing understanding of scientific methods either to a topic relevant to society and the human experience or to an area of knowledge or mode of inquiry outside the natural sciences and mathematics. In this way, SP courses are multi-disciplinary in focus. Because empirical methods and quantitative reasoning are used in a variety of disciplines, the topics of the SP courses span the study of the physical world, biological processes, human behavior, mathematical methods, and technological innovations. SP courses provide an illustration of the application of the scientific method through an active learning, problem-oriented experience for students. Courses that may be crosslisted with Scientific Perspectives (e.g.,  readings, these books are about human nature and what it means to be human.

Courses in this component provide the opportunity to analyze the conditions and consequences of human diversity in its local and transnational forms. To satisfy this requirement, each student will successfully complete a designated course that inquires into the ways that people seek to make sense of a diverse and increasingly interconnected world. Global Engagements (GE) courses come from departments and programs throughout the university. A number of Colgate study group directors' courses have also been approved to satisfy this requirement. GE courses take a variety of forms. For instance, a course in this component might ask students to do one of the following:  examine the consequences of globalization in one or more of its many forms,  investigate issues or processes that have an impact that can be fully understood only by using a global perspective,  experience the cross-cultural understanding that comes from intensive language learning or study group participation,  cross boundaries by examining how diversity finds expression in human culture, or  consider human diversity in dimensions such as race, class, and gender. Ultimately, the GE requirement seeks to empower students to live responsibly in contexts that require an understanding of the complexity of human beings and their impact, whether in the United States or in the broader world. A Global Engagements course may count toward a student's major or minor; it may also fulfill an Areas of Inquiry requirement. Students are expected to take at least one CI or GE course that is not focused exclusively on the United States. Global Engagements courses will be identified in the registration materials available each semester. Distinction Seminar in the Liberal Arts Core Director Frey The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student's departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways:  by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project;  by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or  by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental projects. To enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

Art History The department offers more than 20 courses that trace the visual arts from antiquity to the present day. Classroom lectures are supplemented by visits to museums in the area and in New York City, as well as Colgate's Clifford Gallery, Picker Art Gallery, and Longyear Museum. In this way, students increase their understanding of the visual arts as expressions of fundamental cultural values. Studio Art Courses explore creative modes of expression and problem solving while gaining familiarity with contemporary issues in visual art. The curriculum supports a variety of mediums including digital art, drawing, painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, and video art at the introductory and advanced levels. Studio arts courses are enriched by an ongoing series of visiting artists' lectures, exhibitions, and screenings as well as regular visits to New York City galleries, museums, and artists' studios. The Clifford Gallery is a teaching gallery featuring four to six exhibitions a year. Exhibitions are selected by the art and art history faculty to explore issues originating in the academic curriculum. The primary focus is the display of professional work by contemporary artists. These artists are often featured in the weekly public lecture series described below. The Clifford Gallery is open to the entire community and contributes to the cultural life of the central New York area. The Department of Art and Art History Lecture Series Lectures take place every other week in Little Hall's Golden Auditorium. The series features presentations by studio artists, art historians, and critics, and serves as an arena for discussion of a wide range of subjects relevant to the study of the visual arts. Recent participants have included art historians and practicing sculptors, painters, film and video makers, printmakers, photographers, architects, and artists working in digital art and performance. The series is required as part of the curriculum and is open to the community. It also serves as a venue for welcoming Colgate graduates back to discuss their work in the visual arts. The Alternative Cinema Series takes place weekly on Tuesday evenings. This is a series of films and videos ranging from "classic" cinema to the current avant-garde. Each semester several film/video makers, historians, or curators visit campus and present work in person for the series. The Picker Art Gallery This professional gallery maintains the Colgate University collections, including some 11,000 works from a wide range of cultures and historical periods. Although it is not part of the Department of Art and Art History, the Picker Art Gallery provides an important resource to students, faculty, alumni, and friends of Colgate through exhibitions and sponsorship of the Friends of the Visual Arts.

Architecture Minor This minor offers a program of study by which our undergraduates can become more adept at understanding the power of the built environment to shape lives and embody values. The goal of the Minor is to offer a coherent course of study that focuses on architecture as a cultural product. Through courses that explore architectural history and theory as well as courses that examine the intersection of architecture with other forms of art, such as painting and sculpture, students will gain an understanding of architecture's impact on human lives and culture. For more information about the department, transfer credit, etc., visit the art and art history department page. Minor Requirements The minor includes a minimum of six courses as follows. Introductory Course   - Art & Theory 1980 to Present (AH)   - Art & Theory 1980 to Present (AH) Additional Courses - Art Periods Two courses in art history in a least two different periods listed below. One may be at the 100 level if taken in the first two years. Art Prior to 1300:   - Art & Theory 1980 to Present (AH)   - Art & Theory 1980 to Present (AH)   - Art & Theory 1980 to Present (AH) Focuses on the artistic outburst in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Breaking away from the traditional chronological survey of art along a Europe-US axis, students study themes and issues such as relational aesthetics, collaboration, and globalization to understand how art has been reinvented within the contemporary period. Along with studying particular artists and art practices, students discuss the increased importance of curators and exhibitions, especially the biennial system, as central to the circulation and networking of contemporary· art.

Begins with an examination of the challenges to rationalism raised by the Dada and Surrealists groups in the context of World War I and its aftermath. The course also considers the forms of realism that coalesced concurrently in several countries as a reaction to the shifting political landscape of the interwar years. The reemergence of abstract painting at mid-century is considered in relation to the theoretical formation of modernist criticism and the tensions of the Cold War. Through the analysis of case studies — such as iconic exhibitions and the publication of key theoretical interventions — the students will develop close readings of objects and texts and situate them in their geo-political, theoretical, and social contexts.

ANTH 300," - Museum Studies in Native American Cultures (MC, GR, FR)   - Museum Studies in Native American Cultures (MC, GR, FR) offer students the opportunity to become acquainted with the museum holdings and to carry out research projects on selected collections of artifacts. Students may also arrange independent studies working with the museum collections and receive credit in either the Department of Sociology and Anthropology or in the Native American Studies Program, which is sponsored by the Division of University Studies. Students are encouraged to inquire at the offices of the curators of the Longyear Museum of Anthropology concerning independent studies projects in cultural anthropology or archaeology, as well as for information concerning museum internship programs and opportunities in museum studies and summer programs in archaeological or ethnographic fieldwork. Related Majors The sociology and anthropology department, along with departments in the social sciences, arts and humanities, and natural sciences, offers an interdisciplinary major in Native American Studies with a study group in Santa Fe.   Anthropology Major Anthropology is the study of human beings in all their complexity. The scope of anthropology is truly global, as it aims to describe and analyze the full diversity of the human experience and cultural creativity across time and space. Anthropology recognizes that human beings are, simultaneously, social actors who create cultures and the products of those cultures. Using a broad array of research methods, including participant-observation and archaeological excavation, anthropologists investigate the historical composition of societies, their transformations, and their contemporary forms. We seek to understand the commonalities and differences in the identities, experiences, discourses, and beliefs of people around the world. We connect the details of people's everyday lives to large-scale social systems and cultural forces and reveal that seemingly innate or natural differences among human groups are the result of historical, social, and political-economic processes. The curriculum integrates classroom and out-of-classroom learning, encouraging students to pursue off-campus study and independent fieldwork or research with collections. For more information about the department, honors/high honors, transfer credit, etc., visit the Sociology and Anthropology department page. Major Requirements The anthropology major consists of five required courses, a fieldwork requirement (FR), and four elective courses. Of the electives, one course must satisfy an archaeology, museum studies, or material culture requirement (MC), and one course must satisfy a geographic region or area requirement (GR). 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

ANTH 330," - Deep Time: Representing the Human Past in Contemporary South Africa (Extended Study)   - Deep Time: Representing the Human Past in Contemporary South Africa (Extended Study) Focuses on how the "deep African past" has been imagined and represented by authoritative knowledge-producing institutions including academic disciplines like Anthropology and Archaeology, museums, and site-specific public education projects. The course also considers how authoritative interpretations of "the past" reflect contemporary political and nationalist interests, biases, and knowledge-producing projects. The course asks how some indigenous peoples become enshrined as exemplars of the generalized human past, and how their representation shifts with changing views of human nature. The three-week extended study component in South Africa will visit museums, archaeological sites, and historical monuments to more recent events in the history of that country.

HIST 251," - The Politics of History (TR)  Other courses at the Advisory Committee's discretion Electives   - The Politics of History (TR) While the discipline of history is often approached as a collection of static, undisputed facts, the past is constantly re-interpreted and re-written to suit the needs of those living in the present. Far from being an apolitical exercise or a straightforward empirical investigation, history is contested and hijacked by individuals and groups who seek to use it to advance their interests and promote their agendas. History is not only subject to intense and divisive public debates, it frequently appears at the center of both latent and active inter-group conflicts. Through close readings of key texts and hands-on engagement with contemporary case studies, this course aims to provide a broad overview of the politics of history. The scope of the course is global, and the methodological approach is multi-disciplinary, spanning such fields as history, political science, public and international affairs, memory studies, museum studies, and peace and conflict studies.

CORE 108S," - The Story of Colorants   - The Story of Colorants Colors are all around and people tend to take them for granted. Throughout history, humans have employed colors in artistic and creative expression, particularly in jewelry, ceramics, textile and metal art and in paintings. Some colorants occur naturally. Other colorants are manufactured, and thus the result of scientific and industrial development. In this course, students explore the history and material science of colorants. The interplay between artistic expression and science/technological discovery is considered with emphasis on the materials used in textile art and in paintings. In the process, students find out how science can be used to authenticate artwork. Is a work of art an original by a "famous artist," have parts been reworked by someone else, or is it a forgery? In addition to lectures and discussions, students participate in small group hands-on projects.

CORE 118S," - Gems   - Gems Gems and precious stones have been the objects of fascination and delight for thousands of years. They have been worn as adornments and amulets to bring their wearer strength and invincibility, good health and luck, love and wisdom. Gems have been portrayed as having magical powers, and the desire to own these crystalline droplets of beauty has led to murder and intrigue, theft and deception, wars and suffering. This course examines the origin, history, myths, and lore of diamonds, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, as well as a score of other precious stones. Students study their chemical, physical, crystallographic, and optical properties; how they form; and where they are found. They assess the cost - in environmental degradation and human lives - to extract gems from the Earth's crust, and read about the brutal history and mysterious ways of the diamond business. Finally, students discuss and evaluate New Age claims for crystal healing, crystal balls, and crystals used as amulets and talismans.

Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as "the Dark Continent" in European discourses of the nineteenth century.

Many of the topics discussed are centered on the view that the function of art and the function of the visual brain are one and the same. Students thus consider that the aims of the artist in rendering a particular piece of art essentially constitute an extension of the processes of the visual brain. By taking this point of view (through an introductory understanding of the sensory and perceptual processes of the visual brain) students discuss possible outlines of a theory of aesthetics that is biologically based. Students are required to read chapters from different textbooks devoted to sensory and perceptual processes as they relate to visual art, as well as review articles from professional journals.

Theoretical perspectives on the relationships between and among population processes and the environment are considered on the basis of empirical evidence and also within the context of political debate and popular discourse. Students engage this topic through analytics skills in demography to measure and model population characteristics such as growth, distribution, fertility, mortality, and migration; and in selected environmental processes including climate and weather, land and landscapes, water resources, and biological resources and biodiversity. Having gained perspectives and skills to address population and environment interactions, students examine a global, national, or regional case study of observed and expected relationships between population processes and environmental resources, processes, and systems.

HIST 313," - Upstate History (US)   - Upstate History (US) Examines the rich political, social, and cultural history of upstate New York, with a focus on central New York in the 19th century. As the 18th century came to a close, upstate was a borderland between European settlers and Native Americans. In the antebellum era, the region became a center of the anti-slavery and women's rights movements—and an economic powerhouse where canals and railroads encouraged agricultural prosperity, industrialization, and tourism. Before the Civil War, utopian communities, religious experimentation, and new institutional forms flourished; remnants of many of these movements and markets can still be found on the landscape today. Students will complete regular public history labs - conversations and activities with practitioners from around the state engaging the fields of museum studies and public history.

PCON 355," - Rwanda since the 1994 Genocide   Corequisite: None Prerequisites:  - Rwanda since the 1994 Genocide Assesses the Rwandan experience of post-conflict reconstruction and reconciliation to ask how sustainable is the country's post-genocide recovery? Principally concerned with understanding how to do field research in difficult settings such as post-genocide Rwanda. Using the 'do no harm' framework of doing research with individuals who have lived through mass violence, students are equipped to undertake research in foreign field settings beyond the Rwandan case. In particular, students learn to design a 'human subjects' research proposal, rooted in The Belmont Report of ethical research and guidelines for research involving human subjects. Using Rwanda since the 1994 genocide as a case study, these principles will be studied to highlight their shortcomings in the context of research in post-conflict societies, while highlighting the importance of ethical research methods.

WRIT 210," - The Rhetoric of Style   - The Rhetoric of Style   - The Rhetoric of Style   - The Rhetoric of Style In ancient Greece and Rome, teachers of rhetoric taught style (elocutio) as one of five essential canons, or rules, for effective and persuasive communication. By this rule, an effective communicator reaches an audience not just through the content of speech, but also through its artful expression. This course studies how writers' stylistic choices can profoundly influence the reception and interpretation of texts. With the goal of practicing new stylistic techniques in their own writing, students closely analyze published authors' diction, sentence structure, punctuation, and figures of speech. Readings for the course include short sample pieces from a variety of genres, written by a variety of authors, as models. Because an understanding of prescriptive English grammar is essential to experiments in style, students review the parts of speech and 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

Ammerman (Chair), Garland Associate Professors Rood, Stull Assistant Professors Benson, Tober Visiting Assistant Professor Forte Senior Research Professor A. Ammerman The Department of the Classics embraces a multifaceted approach to the ancient Greek and Roman world, studying not only language and literature but also history, art, archaeology, religion, politics, philosophy, and anthropology. Students may choose to pursue a major in Latin, Greek, the Classics, or Classical Studies. Majors in Latin, Greek, or the Classics make language and literature their main focus; majors in Classical Studies give less emphasis to the languages but acquire a broad understanding of different aspects of ancient civilization. Many of the Department's courses — such as Greek Art, Classical Mythology, Sexuality and Gender in Ancient Greece and Rome, The Tragic and Comic Muse, and Greek Religion — also complement offerings in a range of subject areas across the curriculum. Recent graduates from the Department of the Classics are pursuing diverse careers in fields such as law, medicine, advertising, computer science, and education. Many, too, have gone on to do graduate work in Classics or related disciplines.  - Visual Rhetorics   - Visual Rhetorics Approaches the study of rhetoric by foregrounding the dynamic relationship of text and image. How does a writer's combination of verbal and visual elements communicate different arguments when circulated among different audiences? How do verbal/visual texts imitate, represent, and/or constitute cultural identities, norms, values, or practices? With the goal of becoming effective rhetorical critics, as well as incisive consumers and producers of visual culture, students in this course study a variety of visual texts in print and electronic form and examine these texts' complex powers of persuasion. The primary work is to develop and strengthen fluency in rhetorical discourse and visual literacy, as students work to perceive and analyze, as well as design and create, verbal-visual texts.

O'Connor Writing Fellows Hansen, Jaeger, Kioko, Strasser The Department of English offers courses in two programs of study, one in literature written in the English language and the second in English with an emphasis in creative writing. Students may pursue majors and minors in both these areas. An English major develops students' ability to use language effectively and enhances their critical and analytical skills by making them aware of the social and historical context in which writing, in any of its forms, is produced. English study provides an excellent basis for professional programs in law, journalism, publishing, and business as well as for graduate study in literature, the theater, or creative writing. Students pursuing one of the majors in the department take courses in specified categories described in detail below. There is considerable choice from among the courses that fulfill these requirements, and students should discuss their programs with an adviser in planning a major. English courses also serve as electives for students in other programs. Normally 200-level courses are for first-year and sophomore students; 300-level courses, for sophomores, juniors, and seniors; and 400-level courses for juniors and seniors. There are a few specified prerequisites for individual courses. Non-majoring students considering 400-level English courses as electives, however, should consult catalogue descriptions and may wish to speak with instructors to determine their readiness for particular courses. Continued study of a foreign language or work in the literature of other languages in translation is particularly recommended as complementary to an English major and is especially important for students interested in further literary studies. Writing is an important component of coursework. Awards The Allen Prizes in English Composition — established in memory of Hattie Boyd Allen — two prizes in English composition. The Jonathan H.

Advanced Placement The department does not award Advanced Placement credit. Transfer Credit Because transferred courses must conform in content and rigor to Colgate's curriculum, students intending to take a course in English literature at another institution must meet with the department's transfer-credit adviser before enrolling in a course at another institution. Transfer credit for an English course taken at another college or university will be granted only by the approval of the department. The transfer-credit adviser grants preliminary approval for appropriate courses, which generally must resemble 300- or 400-level courses at Colgate. Upon return to campus, the student brings the course syllabus, all papers written for the course, and a transcript registering its completion to the transfer-credit adviser to receive final approval. No more than two courses (in the case of a minor, one course) may be transferred for major credit. Students may not use a transferred course to fulfill the 400-level seminar requirement of the major.

Serving as a gateway to rich literary and artistic traditions as well as the discourses of philosophy and critical theory, German also enables students to access Germanophone Europe's many contributions to the social and natural sciences. The department's academic program is structured to enable students to pursue their interests in German as well as related fields: the beginning and intermediate language courses emphasize cultural knowledge about contemporary German-speaking societies and provide a strong foundation in the skills of speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing German. German 351 fosters students' capacities for advanced study of German language, literature, and cultural history, while enabling them to conduct related academic work in German. Additional courses at the 300 level feature diverse topics in German literary and cultural studies, while seminars at the 400 level undertake intensive and focused investigations of seminal periods and genres of the German literary and cultural imagination. The study of German can be integral to students' academic pursuits as whole. The department encourages students to enroll in related courses in other disciplines such as philosophy, history, music, international relations, linguistics, and art history. A major in German is an excellent preparation for graduate studies in these fields as well as in literature and German studies, and can also give students a competitive edge in such fields as economics, politics, law, business, journalism, consulting, and publishing. German not only provides students with the necessary basis for a rigorous or sophisticated understanding of central European culture, but also develops in them a more profound understanding of their native language and of the relationship between language and knowledge: to speak with Goethe, "Wer fremde Sprachen nicht kennt, weiß nichts von seiner eignen" (those who don't know foreign languages know nothing of their own). Awards The Valentine Piotrow German Prizes — two awards for excellence in German. Advanced Placement and Transfer Credit Both university and major credits are normally granted to students who achieve a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examinations in German language and literature or a score of 6 or 7 on the higher level International Baccalaureate German exam. Transfer credit for courses taken at other institutions may be granted with the approval of the department chair. Honors and High Honors An honors project allows students to build on their knowledge to pursue independent research on a topic of their interest in close consultation with one or several faculty members. Students with a GPA of 3.30 in courses included in the major and with a cumulative GPA of 3.00 are eligible for honors in German. Students who have attained that average may apply to pursue honors by the early fall of the senior year.

Klein, Tumulty, Witherspoon Assistant Professors Blackman, Lennertz, Nisenbaum Visiting Assistant Professor Bulthuis Lecturer Pendleton Philosophy is a central component of a liberal arts education. It raises fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the place of human beings within it. What is the nature of morality? What is free will and are human beings free? What is the relation between mind and body? What, if anything, can we know about the material world? Does God exist? What makes a state just? What makes for a good life? In attempting to answer such questions, students of philosophy reflect on both their own responses to these questions and the ways in which past thinkers have defended their answers to them. The process of formulating and testing these answers requires education in logical analysis, reasoned argument, and analytic thinking. In acquiring such education within the philosophy curriculum, students develop their ability to solve problems and to think, read, and write critically — skills that are in high demand in a number of different professions. Philosophy majors go on to successful careers in law, consulting, finance, and medicine. Many have also embarked on academic careers. But philosophy is about more than reflection and finding answers. As the love of wisdom, it is also a practice and a way of life, one characterized by openness to viewpoints other than one's own, a willingness to question both received opinions and one's own opinions, and a passionate concern to integrate thought and practice into a meaningful life. The department offers a number of courses that serve as gateways to the practice of philosophy. These gateway courses are  - Jazz Theory and Improvisation (PF) Offers the study of basic jazz theory and its application in jazz improvisation. Topics include chord/scale relationships, musical line construction and development, jazz as a language, tension and release techniques, analysis of transcribed solos recorded by jazz masters, ear training, and jazz phrasing. Students play in class and practice outside of the classroom with pre-recorded rhythm section tracks. Theoretical material and several jazz compositions are memorized with students learning to play this material from memory on their instruments. Exams include written and performance segments. It is expected that enrolling students can read music and have played their instrument for at least three years. Open to wind, string, and keyboard musicians.

By analyzing both our concepts and our experience, students will try to answer questions like: What is the relation between experience and the world beyond the mind? Do beliefs about the world amount to knowledge? Is the content of experience conceptual – and so fully expressible in language – or does experience have a richness that always surpasses the expressive power of language? Where do concepts come from? What fixes their content, and what fixes the meaning of the words that express them? If the content of language is based in part on experience, can one understand the language of someone whose experience is different?

The philosophy of this period is called 'modern' because it made a distinct break with older traditions and because the questions it asked remain the central issues for philosophers today. Studying modern philosophy will help students think creatively about what there is, what we are, and what we can know. Readings will be selected from classic works by Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Hume, and Kant.

PHIL 303," - Medieval Philosophy (MF)  ,  - Medieval Philosophy (MF)   - Medieval Philosophy (MF) Medieval philosophy involved the absorption and transformation of Greek and Hellenistic thought by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers, often in relations of mutual influence. The period is crucial not only for its project of reconciling reason and faith but also for philosophical insights, arguments, and formulations that have remained influential in several of the main areas of philosophy. The course focuses on questions concerning freedom of the will, the nature of moral requirements and obligation, the role of rational considerations in morality, the virtues, and ideals of human excellence. Students read figures from the three faith traditions and explore their interactions and mutual influences, as well as their differences. Coverage of Jewish, Christian, and Muslim thinkers is roughly equal, and students look at the Platonic, Neoplatonic, and Aristotelian background to their thought as well as the new directions in which they took philosophy.

Religion courses offer training in a unique combination of skills, including close textual analysis, direct observation, critical thinking, and cross-cultural understanding. The department offers a variety of courses regarding diverse African, Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Islamic, Jewish, and Native American traditions and scriptures. In addition to courses focused on particular traditions, the department also offers courses on the relationship between religion and issues of historic and contemporary importance, such as the environment, terrorism, medicine, gender, and the law. The study of religion is necessarily interdisciplinary, making reflective use of the full variety of liberal arts methods. In addition, it engages related issues in philosophy, ethics, society, spirituality, science, gender, sexuality, arts, and politics. Thus, a major or minor in religion may serve as a natural complement to other majors. Students in the arts and humanities, for instance, will find that the study of religious texts and worlds affords them greater insight into literature and visual art. Some students may seek to make stronger interdisciplinary connections. In consultation with an adviser, students may elect to create a track through the religion major or minor that brings their work in religion into dialogue with their work in other departments or programs. Possible tracks include: Religion, Politics, and Law The department offers courses that examine the intersection of religion and politics, past and present, explore the legal frameworks of a variety of religious traditions, and ask students to think about the role of ethics and morality in public life. Students interested in history, international relations, peace and conflict studies, or political science will find that a minor or second major in religion allows them a better understanding of many of the longstanding ideological conflicts that have shaped the contemporary world. Religion and Health Students interested in the natural sciences who intend to enter the fields of medicine and health sciences will find that courses in religion equip them to evaluate the moral complexity of current scientific advances. A host of religion courses probe questions that are central to medicine and health: questions of body and soul, psychic states and mindfulness, sex and sexuality, life and death. These are treated in a variety of religious traditions, offering the pre-med student a comparative approach to health and healing. The success of our graduates indicates that a major in religion provides excellent preparation for a number of careers, including education, government, journalism, finance, law, social work, and professional service in non-profit organizations and religious institutions. 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

Language courses work to improve students' abilities in speaking, comprehending, reading, and writing in French, Italian, or Spanish, while providing an introduction to culture. Structured in levels of increasing complexity, literature courses foster the improvement of analytical and critical skills, an enhanced aesthetic appreciation of works of literary art, and a broader understanding of linguistic and cultural diversity. Many of the courses offered in the department may be taken by students who do not plan to major in French or Spanish but who would like to maintain or develop their knowledge of these languages and cultures. Given the multi-cultural nature of the United States today, familiarity with a second language and culture will enhance a student's preparation for a career in any profession. Advanced study of Spanish or French (300 level and higher) makes the student eligible for the intimate contact with a foreign culture available through the department's study groups abroad. A major in French or Spanish can be particularly useful in the fields of law, business, international trade, journalism, education, and public administration. The department offers majors and minors in both French and Spanish, but not in Italian. Courses counting toward these majors are conducted entirely in the appropriate language. Awards The Award for Excellence in French Studies — awarded in recognition of consistently outstanding performance in French.

Giurgea Associate Professor DuComb, Sweeney (Chair) Visiting Assistant Professor Avaunt, Ntokozo Senior Lecturer S. Giurgea Theater predates recorded history and remains a vital mode of artistic expression in the modern world. The Department of Theater educates students in the interdisciplinary practice of theater through required courses in acting, directing, stagecraft, and stage design, as well as elective courses in playwriting, screenwriting, and dance. Students also study theater as a social and cultural institution through courses in theater history and dramatic literature. Each semester, the department mounts a major production in the University Theater, directed either by a member of the theater faculty or a distinguished guest artist. Theater courses and University Theater productions are open not only to theater majors and minors but to all students on campus. Theater students at Colgate learn by doing in the intellectually and physically rigorous environment of studio courses, rehearsals, and public performances. The curriculum transcends the artificial split of mind and body, encouraging students to develop skills in both logic and intuition that apply to any field of endeavor. A major or minor in theater fosters students' ability to read closely, think critically, and communicate clearly -- not only through speech and writing, but also through embodied presence. Students of theater are trained to integrate analytical, physical, emotional, and interpersonal intelligence in a way that few other courses of study demand. By making and studying theater, Colgate students act out a variety of perspectives on the world, learning to problem solve and self-start through immersion in the challenges of the creative process. Students have opportunities both to lead and to collaborate. Graduates regularly pursue successful careers not only in theater but also in communications, media, business, law, and technology. Students interested in majoring or minoring in theater should discuss their plans with an adviser, and consider courses in music, art and art history, film and media studies, English, foreign languages and cultures to complement their theater education.

The course follows its development through readings of Prèvost, Crébillon fils, Diderot, Denon, and Sade, and explores the following questions: How do philosophy, fiction, and sexual politics coalesce in libertine literature? How can one reconcile libertinage - a way of living and writing frequently reduced to passion and sensuality - with the broader currents of the most "rational" century in French literary history? An exploration of libertine literature thus entails a focus on cultural history, and serves as a point of departure for a broader reflection on the Enlightenment.

It provides students with an understanding of the origins and development of the Islamic faith in its heartland, as well as an awareness of the multi-cultural and dynamic character of modern Islam. It also trains students in the history, culture, politics, and political economy of the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world. The area encompassed by this program extends from Morocco to the Philippines. It contains an extraordinary variety of linguistic and ethnic groups such as Arabs, Iranians, Turkic peoples, Kurds, Baluchis, Malays, and others. This region is home to over 1.4 billion Muslims, who constitute more than one-fifth of the world's population. It is the source of a rich religious and intellectual tradition that emerged from the same roots as the Western tradition and evolved over a long history of interaction with the West. It also plays an important role in global peace, security, and prosperity. These demographic, cultural, and strategic considerations will lead to a steady increase in contact between the Islamic world and the United States in the future. The Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Program (MIST) program equips Colgate students with the knowledge and conceptual tools needed to understand and manage this relationship. The themes addressed by the program include the history and development of the Islamic faith; colonialism and its impact on the cultures, economies, and polities of the region; the rise of nationalism and its relationship to tribal, religious, and ethnic identities; the emergence and impact of political Islam; the Arab-Israeli conflict; the prospects for democratization; and United States foreign policy toward the Middle East, North Africa, and the Islamic world.

SPAN 468," - Visions and Re-visions of the Spanish Conquest: An Interdisciplinary Perspective   - Visions and Re-visions of the Spanish Conquest: An Interdisciplinary Perspective Combines historical and literary approaches to examine early representations and interpretations of the Spanish discovery and conquest of the Caribbean and Mexico. The first half of the course compares texts produced by indigenous and Spanish actors during the Conquest period. The analysis of letters, chronicles, treatises, codices and other documents offers insight on the diverse Spanish and Native understandings of the events and ways of portraying them, and on the fierce legal and moral debates that the Conquest engendered among Spaniards. The second half of the course focuses on retrospective representations of the Conquest during the established colonial regime. The analysis of plays, poetry, works of art, and other texts of the 16th and 17th centuries reveals how the Conquest and its aftermath were reimagined by Spanish and Creole subjects, enabling them to articulate new forms of power, authority and hybrid identity.

SPAN 476," - Linguistic History of Spain   - Linguistic History of Spain   - Linguistic History of Spain This seminar provides advanced-level language students with the understanding of the evolution of the Spanish language.

These external and internal developments are considered within the context of linguistic diversity of pre-modern Iberia. Special attention is paid to historical explanations of "irregularities" found in modern Spanish. Therefore, the course is of interest to students who wish to improve their understanding of the idiosyncrasies of the Spanish language. The class also linguistically analyzes a selection from pre-modern texts. This analysis is of particular interest to students who plan to take courses in medieval, Golden Age, and colonial Spanish literature.

The department considers such transfer credits individually, and students should provide information about the courses (syllabi, catalogue statements, lab notebooks, textbooks, etc.) to the department chair for consideration. These arrangements should be made well before beginning classes at Colgate. Matriculated Colgate students may receive credit for chemistry courses taken at other colleges/universities. Summer courses must meet several criteria established by the department concerning the course content, the length of the course, and the number and length of class and laboratory meetings. Students considering transferring credit to Colgate for a summer chemistry course should obtain a copy of the department's criteria for an acceptable course, discuss the course with the department chair, and receive approval before taking the summer course. Final acceptance of the transfer credit is contingent upon satisfactory performance on an equivalency exam; the department administers this exam prior to the drop/add period for the fall term immediately following the summer course. Other International Exam Transfer Credit Transfer credit and/or placement appropriate to academic development of a student may be granted to incoming first year students who have achieved a score on an international exam (e.g., International Baccalaureate, Abitur) that indicates a level of competence equivalent to the completion of a specific course in the department. Requests should be directed to the department chair. Any such credit may not be used to fulfill the university areas of inquiry requirement, but may count towards the major. Summer Research Opportunities Colgate's chemistry department has a rich summer research program and there are numerous summer research opportunities at university, government, and private labs around the country.

Related Majors  Astrogeophysics Major   Physical Science Major  Pre-Engineering Studies The department offers two ways to prepare for engineering: major in physics at Colgate and after graduation go to graduate school in engineering, or use one of the combined plans available in the department. To allow a student to combine education in the liberal arts with engineering training, Colgate has cooperative agreements with Columbia University and Washington University. A student may spend three years at Colgate and two at the engineering school (the 3-2 plan) to earn bachelor's degrees from both institutions.

Although the majority of majors ultimately pursue careers in the life sciences, a significant number of individuals with other career interests choose the major within the liberal arts context. The department's majors are found today in positions of responsibility in many fields outside the life sciences, including business, theology, law, and the performing arts. Biology majors who are interested in pursuing a career in elementary or secondary school teaching should refer to Educational Studies. Students expecting to attend graduate or professional schools are reminded that these schools frequently recommend or require calculus, statistics, computer science, chemistry (typically through organic), and a year of physics as cognates to the biology major. Awards The Oswald T. Avery Award — awarded by the department in honor of Dr. Oswald T. Avery, who graduated in the class of 1900 and subsequently made major research discoveries in molecular biology at the Rockefeller Institute. The award is given each year to one or more senior majors in molecular biology chosen by the faculty on the basis of academic achievement, academic development, research project, and departmental service. The Raymond J. Myers Award — awarded by the department in honor of Professor Raymond J. Myers, who taught biology at Colgate from 1934 to 1972. The award is given each year to one or more senior majors in biology chosen by the faculty on the basis of academic achievement, academic development, research project, and departmental service. The Christopher Oberheim Memorial Award — established as an award for a biology student chosen by the faculty on the basis of showing great promise in research, as evidenced by previous work.

E. Smith Laboratory Instructors Cucura, Lyboult Computer science is the study of algorithmic processes and the machines that carry out these processes. Computer science is a mix of theory, application, design, and experiment. Theory addresses questions about the nature and limits of computation, the abstract properties of machine models, the complexity of algorithms, and the formalization of programming languages. Applications include machine and systems design, the design and implementation of programming languages, artificial intelligence, networks, graphics, and simulation. An important aspect of computer science is the development of methods for the systematic design of large systems in hardware and software. Both applications and theoretical issues must be tested experimentally. The computer science major prepares students either for graduate study in computer science or for a variety of professional careers. The computer science minor and the major in computer science/mathematics prepare students for professions in which computer science overlaps significantly with another discipline.        Prerequisites:  - Introduction to Electricity and Magnetism Lab 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

It is a multi-disciplinary science that explores the physical and chemical nature of the Earth, the evolution and impact of life on our planet, and how global processes operate both now and in the past. Geology focuses on the scientific study of Earth materials, such as minerals, rocks, and fossils, as well as Earth-observing data derived from satellites, geophysical instruments, and models. The geosciences explain how past and present-day ecosystems and environments have been and are continuing to be shaped by plate tectonics, volcanism, mountain building, climate change, evolution, and human activity through time.  Introductory courses are designed to contribute significantly to a liberal arts education and an understanding of Earth and the environment. Advanced courses are more focused and provide the highest possible level of general and pre-professional training for majors. Majors in geology or environmental geology provide students with the opportunity to pursue careers in the geological and environmental sciences, business, and education, as well as government and public service. Upon graduation, many geology majors attend graduate school in geology, hydrology, oceanography, environmental sciences, and environmental policy and law. Other graduates go directly into a wide spectrum of employment situations, including business, environmental consulting, teaching, administration in schools and museums, and mineral resources and petroleum-related jobs. Students considering attending graduate school in geology should note that graduate schools expect applicants to have supplemented their undergraduate geology majors with a year each of introductory calculus, chemistry, and physics or biology. The geology department encourages all majors to take these courses; they are required for honors in geology. Students interested in paleontology are encouraged to take  - Mathematical Logic The topics covered include the following: propositional and predicate calculus, completeness and compactness theorems, the foundations of nonstandard analysis, first-order model theory, recursive functions, a full proof of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem, and undecidability.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

The planet currently faces abrupt climate change resulting from human-induced environmental modification. Paleoclimatology, the study of past climates and environments of the Earth, provides a long-term perspective on the nature of global climate variability that is critical for evaluating the sensitivity of the Earth system to past, present, and future changes. This course provides students with an overview of paleoclimatology by examining the use of proxy records such as marine and lake sediment sequences, ice cores, tree rings, corals, and historical data to reconstruct past climatic conditions. Dating methods are introduced, and seminal publications in paleoclimatology are reviewed in tandem with current research papers addressing outstanding questions in paleoclimatology. Throughout, students critically analyze their current understanding of past climates and environments, and identify promising directions for future research. Topics include abrupt climate change, human evolution and climate, biosphere-climate interactions, and paleoclimate modeling.  Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: "

Mathematical Systems Biology Minor Ingram (Chair of the Department of Biology) Valente (Chair of the Department of Mathematics) Mathematical systems biology describes a field of inquiry in which mathematical and computational methods are used to examine complex, large scale interactions between components of biological systems and to predict how these interactions influence the properties of those systems. The systems examined may range in scale from molecular through cellular and tissue levels to the scale of organisms and entire ecosystems. The unifying feature of this field is quantitative description of interactions between components of biological systems. The interface between mathematics and biology is one of the most rapidly expanding areas of research in the sciences. The technological development of methods for generating large amounts of biological data — including genome sequence information, total protein analysis, metabolic information, etc. — demands the development of mathematical and computational methods for analyzing these data and for developing predictive models that use such large data sets. The multidisciplinary field of systems biology requires an understanding of both mathematical and biological concepts, insights into interesting questions in biology, and comprehension of the mathematical methods that can be used to address many of those questions. The mathematical systems biology minor provides students with the coursework in mathematics and biology required to begin to gain insights and experience in this important new field. For more information about the department, transfer credit, etc., visit the mathematics department page.

Kraly, R. Shiner, Tierney Associate Professors Conti, Hansen, D. Johnson, Martinez, Yoshino Assistant Professors Cooley, Liu, Tomlinson, Philbrook Visiting Assistant Professor Dyer Lecturer Albert The Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (PBS) offers two areas of concentration, Psychological Science and Neuroscience. Psychological Science The core of psychological science is the study of human and animal behavior. As a discipline, it is dedicated to identifying and understanding basic and complex processes including sensation and perception, learning and memory, thought and language, motivation and emotion, development, personality, psychopathology, and social interaction. These processes are examined from a variety of levels of analysis; from the genetic and neuronal, to physiological and cognitive systems, and to whole organism responses and group interactions. By its very nature, psychological science has relevance to a wide range of practical, human problems.  Psychological science offers two introductory courses:  - Independent Study Opportunity for individual study in areas not covered by formal course offerings, under the guidance of a member of the faculty.

The department also offers a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program for students preparing to teach at the secondary level. Given these programs, the department offers a comprehensive study of formal and informal educational institutions and practices, and the ways they are affected by social forces. Interdisciplinary by design, classes draw on diverse methods of inquiry to analyze critically the historical and contemporary ways that people educate and are educated in the United States and societies across the globe. Theory, research, and practice work together to help students become more informed as consumers and producers of knowledge in a variety of educational contexts. Students learn to ask questions about the relationships between knowledge, power, and identity in educational contexts, and to reimagine education and its contribution to a democratic society. Study Groups The South Korea Study Group is a joint program between Educational Studies and Asian Studies. The program offers a dynamic experience for any Colgate University student due in part to its efforts to become a leader in the newly forming globalized world in which we live. South Korea is highly regarded for its rapid modernization, yet the people still hold to its traditional ways in mind and spirit. While the focus is on students' development of educational studies theory and practice from a global perspective, they also gain a fascinating sociocultural experience. Students enroll in four courses. The Director provides two courses for the students, one of which provides an opportunity to design a research project with a fieldwork component. Students then take two courses from the host university, Yonsei University. Yonsei offers a variety of courses in English. One course must be on the topic of Korea or East Asia.

That people are dramatically altering the climate is now the resounding consensus in the scientific community. Potential short- and long-term impacts include biodiversity loss, sea-level rise and coastal flooding, more intense storms, threats to human health, and disruptions of freshwater supplies and food security. But while the global community increasingly understands the basic processes driving climate change, and is starting to appreciate the consequences of a warmer world, the coupled social and biophysical dynamics of global warming are complex and the issue remains controversial. This course explores climate-society relationships in industrial and pre-industrial periods, and considers the multifaceted natural and human dimensions of global warming. It also highlights the integrative natural and social science modes of analysis commonly used in the discipline of geography.

"End of the world" scenarios have been linked to global pandemics, super-volcanoes, artificial intelligence, and melting permafrost. "Is the Planet Doomed" uses these and other examples to study contemporary catastrophism. The course explores arguments that suggest the world may have reached "peak humanity." Potential mass extinction events arise from the convergence of biological, climatic, economic, technological factors on one hand, and war on the other. The course analyzes these factors using the integrative modes of analysis commonly used in the discipline of geography. And it exposes how geography affects the catastrophic imaginary.

Elements of Earth's energy system are used first to establish the basic causal forces that drive all weather phenomena. These concepts are extended into a section on atmospheric forces and thermodynamics, and used to build an understanding of the middle latitude climate system, including middle tropospheric circulation vorticity concepts and surface cyclone and anticyclone development. During this process, students perform several exercises that focus on atmospheric data analysis and forecasting. These exercises make use of numerous online meteorological data resources and culminate in a case study project involving the detailed analysis of a significant weather event.

To set the stage for discussing the geography of life, students first examine the earth's physical setting. This leads to consideration of the fundamental processes determining plant and animal distributions. The interactions among these processes are also examined, thereby introducing the concept of the ecosystem. The functions of an ecosystem are discussed with focuses on energy and matter flow, population dynamics, succession, and disturbance. The culmination of these processes is reflected in broad-scale geographic patterns. Thus, the characteristics of the major biomes are examined. Finally, because humans and the environment are inextricably linked, students explore several impacts humans have on the landscape, including fragmentation, extinction, and species introductions.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

GEOG 306," - The Geography of Happiness    - The Geography of Happiness Achieving some degree of happiness is a primary goal for most people. Certainly, a huge industry has emerged in recent years to feed the public's desire for ways to improve their happiness. There is also a rapidly growing amount of research on the subject. This course starts with an overview of the diverse, multidisciplinary scholarship on factors that may contribute to happiness. But the main goal of the course is to consider themes central to the discipline of geography: how do environmental changes, efforts to achieve sustainable development, and culture affect the geography of happiness? Do people achieve a greater sense of well-being when interacting with wilderness or by exploring nature in their backyards? Does environmental stewardship improve happiness? What roles do attitudes about food and leisure play in how happy people are? Students explore these questions via out-of-class excursions, films, diverse mix of scholarly and popular press readings, guest speakers, and individual research projects.

This course focuses on understanding authoritarianism in the past and present capital cities of Russia (St. Petersburg and Moscow) and Kazakhstan (Almaty and Astana). While remnants of the Tsarist and Soviet built environments still strongly shape urban character, new urban development and demographic change, alongside other economic and geopolitical transformations, have transformed them since 1991. Rapid and changing patterns and styles of urbanization create a multitude of perspectives and experiences within post-socialist cities as our globalizing world blurs the boundaries between urban spaces, individual lives, and abstract conceptualizations of the East, West, or even "post-" socialist places.

GEOG 310,"// - Geopolitics Broadly defined, Geopolitics is the study of "the relationship among politics and geography, demography, and economics, especially with respect to the foreign policy of a nation." As the study of political geography on a global scale, geopolitics examines the relationship between territories, boundaries, and states in the "closed system" we call planet earth. But geopolitics is more than an academic field. Geopolitical thought has actually instructed states how to relate to one another in the contest for territory, security, and resources. For example, the history of geopolitical analysis is closely connected to -- and has often justified -- various imperial projects. As a result, this course examines the relation between the development of geopolitical thought on one hand, and geopolitical events on the other. Of particular importance to the relation between theories of geopolitics and the actual geostrategies of states has been the development of conflict on a planetary scale. And so, this course traces that relation through the study of geopolitical thought and practice in the course of imperial struggles in the 19th century, World Wars and the threat of nuclear wars in the 20th century, and new global challenges such as resource wars and environmental security in our own time.

GEOG 311," - Global Urban    - Global Urban An exploration of contemporary urban geography and academic writing about the city. It introduces students to the ways in which urban geography has played a role, along with other disciplines that focus on the urban, in understanding cities and the issues that surround them. This includes an examination of how cities are conceived, lived, and represented. The course investigates the following topics: What are the various ways that people create, and attempt to materialize, their geographical imaginations of what they want the city to be? What are the ways in which different social groups make claims on space and place, and how does the scale at which these activities occur have effects? What are the critical questions to ask about urban landscapes today? How would you formulate a research proposal on such topics? The course offers a theoretical and practical framework within which to examine the city as a site of socio-cultural and political-economic transformation. In this framework, students analyze how the state, market, and civil society intersect, and how this has changed over the 20th century in the U.S. and other parts of the world.

Addresses environmental issues from the dual perspective of gender relations and social justice to advance students' understandings of the fundamental relationship between human activities and our physical and social environments. To this end, students work across diverse geographies to explore (1) the social relations underlying environmental problems; (2) the ways in which gender, class, race, and ethnicity intersect in environmental issues; and (3) the social and environmental processes that underlie the construction of gender and the life-worlds of the individuals in those "geographies." Students bring a global perspective to the issues by drawing out local-global linkages. Case studies are drawn from North America, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.

GEOG 322," - Ecologies of the City    - Ecologies of the City   - Ecologies of the City   - Ecologies of the City With half of the world's population living in and around cities, the needs of urban-based populations and economies dominate non-urban peoples, places, and habitats worldwide. This course begins with an introduction to political ecology, a body of knowledge combining political economy and cultural ecology. Political economy is the study of how different societies are connected globally, and cultural ecology is the study of the relationship between a society and its natural environment. Although political ecology largely focuses on places and cultures of "pristine" or "native" nature in "other" countries, this course turns to urban 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

GEOG 323,"/// - Arctic Transformations   - Arctic Transformations  Electives One additional course selected from one of the categories above or from the following list of electives, descriptions for which are found under the appropriate department or program's listings.   - Arctic Transformations The Arctic is one of the most rapidly changing regions of the world today, environmentally, culturally, and politically. Rapid biophysical change occurs here today due to climate change, but equally noteworthy are cultural, social, and political transformations experienced by people living and working in the Arctic. People are under increasing pressure to change along with transformation of their biophysical environments, particularly as new actors express interest in the Arctic as space opening up to global transportation, mineral exploration, and trade and ecotourism. Within geography, interest in Arctic phenomena includes grappling with complex issues related to social and biophysical changes in this region, which often originate beyond the region but have specific meaning for the region. Students investigate three vibrant areas of Arctic transformation: cultural transformation occurring among indigenous and local peoples, biological and physical transformation of the environment, and political transformation within and related to the region.

GEOG 328," - Sustainability and Natural Resources    - Sustainability and Natural Resources   - Sustainability and Natural Resources   - Sustainability and Natural Resources Uses social science perspectives on sustainability and sustainable development to analyze the production and consumption of major natural resources. Addresses the following questions: What are natural resources, and how do their geographies combine with those of wealth and poverty, of political power and technological and institutional capacity, to affect the potential for actions towards sustainable development? How is our understanding of sustainable resource development enriched by critical perspectives from the social sciences about the meaning of such contested concepts as sustainability and development, and about issues of equity, power, participation, property rights, and unequal impacts (of both resource depletion and environmental policies)? How can the three dimensions (environmental, social, and economic) of sustainability better guide the production and consumption of natural resources, renewable or nonrenewable, in different places and by different actors? The topical and regional focus of the course varies from year to year; it may, for example, focus on oil (or energy more generally), on minerals, or on biological and genetic resources; and on specific geographic areas, such as central New York, Latin America, or the Arctic.

The primary objective is to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. Most typically, image analysis involves generating landcover maps using multi-spectral data collected by satellites. This course begins by focusing on the physical principles upon which image analysis is based, including the principles of acquiring and interpreting electromagnetic data collected by non-photographic sensors. Students then explore the basic tools of digital image processing (e.g., image enhancement, contract manipulation, etc.). This leads to a consideration of the process of image classification. Lastly, students discuss accuracy assessment as it applies to landcover classification, and spend a significant amount of time in the geography department computer lab performing analysis on remote sensing data.

Study Groups Washington The Washington Study Group, conducted in the spring term each year, provides a unique opportunity for a select group of Colgate students to study the working processes of the American national government at close range. See "Undergraduate Program". Study group members take four courses during their term in Washington, one of which is an internship. Students receive three course credits toward completing the political science major ( do not fulfill this requirement. Recommendations for Majors and Other Students Those interested in studying political science may begin at any course level but are likely to find it most convenient to start with those at the 100 or 200 levels. In consultation with their faculty advisers, students should plan course sequences that fulfill major requirements while allowing them, if so desired, to develop particular interests in some depth while still gaining a well-rounded grounding in the discipline. All majors are encouraged, as well, to take electives in other closely allied social sciences. The 100-level courses are designed for students likely to major in other fields of study as well as those considering a major or minor in political science. The 200-level courses are intended to serve as gateway courses to the major as well as to particular subfields. Both the 100- and 200-level courses, then, serve as general introductions providing a broad foundation in the discipline and are particularly suitable for first - and second - year students. The 300- and 400-level courses are, in most instances, somewhat more demanding and less general than lower-level courses and allow students to explore a specific topic in greater depth. These courses are generally directed, but not limited, to the needs of juniors and seniors. Majors and others interested in one particular area of the discipline, for example in international relations, can take up to seven courses, seminars, or independent studies in that area of interest, especially in classes at the 300 and 400 level. Political Science Minor For more information about the department, transfer credit, etc., visit the political science department page. Minor Requirements Normally, no more than one independent study course, transfer credit, or political science course taken while participating in a Colgate off-campus study group (except those study groups sponsored by the Department of Political Science) is accepted for credit toward a minor. Requests for exceptions must be approved in advance by the faculty member designated to authorize transfer credits. No course with a grade below C will count as credit for the minor. A student may not count courses toward a political science minor, which are being counted toward a major in international relations. The requirements for a minor in political science are as follows: The minor consists of five political science courses. Of these five courses, two must be at the 100 or 200 level and three must be at the 300 or 400 level. The two 100- or 200-level courses cannot be from the same subfield of the curriculum. They must be from two of the following: American politics (AM), comparative politics (CO), international relations (IR), and political theory (TH).   2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

HIST 219," - Oceanic Histories (TR)   - Oceanic Histories (TR) It may seem self-evident that oceans have histories, that far from being timeless, they constantly change. Nonetheless, this is a relatively recent idea. This course takes this idea as its starting point, and in doing so explores oceans and coastal areas as more than simply spaces, but as complex historical entities. Marine environmental history will provide the main framework for the course, although maritime history and oceanic studies concepts--such as Atlantic and Pacific Worlds--will also feature prominently. The course gives particular attention to the period of increasing globalization and drastically intensifying human exploitation of the oceans since roughly the fifteenth century. It also, however, considers pre-modern, pre-industrial relations between humans, oceans, and marine environments, suggesting their mutual influences long before the period usually associated with major human effects on the environment.

HIST 232," - The Crusades (EU)   - The Crusades (EU)   - The Crusades (EU) (with permission of instructor)   - The Crusades (EU) (with permission of instructor)   - The Crusades (EU) In 1099, a crusading army sacked Jerusalem, killing Muslims, Jews, and Christians alike. This act of savagery earned the crusade fame in Christian Europe and infamy in the Islamic world, prompting a crusade movement in the West and a military reaction in the East. The forces stirred up by these events also led Western Europe toward the conquest of Spain, Eastern Europe, Greece, and eventually the Americas and beyond. In this course, students study the causes, progress, and results of the Crusades themselves, as well as the new colonial societies that developed in their wake. Students focus on the transformation of four cultures: western Christendom, Judaism, Byzantium, and Islam.

The course examines a number of very broad themes, such as the interaction of nomadic and sedentary peoples, the spread of religions, cultural confrontation, and syncretism. The course is a challenging one for both instructor and students in that it covers an enormous geographic, cultural, and chronological span.

Traditionally, such comparative studies have focused on the cultural differences among the European colonizers, but this course focuses equally on the cultural differences among the indigenous peoples of the Americas. As the divergent groups confronted and dealt with each other in the 16th and 17th centuries, they established widely varying patterns of living that would impact the histories of their descendants for generations to come.

For most of the 20th century, nationalism competed with other forms of identity in the Middle East, and many of the tensions between local and larger categories of identity among Arabs remain unresolved. Through this course students are made aware of the many forms of affiliation that have competed for primary loyalty in the Arab cultural and political sphere, and of the multiple definitions of "nation" that have co-existed. The historical reasons for the relative success of some interpretations over others are explored. The course focuses on issues of identity, interpretation, and organization that impact the region - and the world - even now.

Hayes, Kraynak, Moore (Chair), Shain Associate Professors Dauber, Fogarty, Koter, Morkevicius, Murshid, Nam, Rutherford Assistant Professors Hedberg, Ibarra del Cueto, Lupton, Luttig, Rosenfeld Visiting Assistant Proefessor Bae Senior Lecturer Yee The department's program is designed to provide students with an understanding and appreciation of politics in the broadest sense and to introduce them to the skills needed for research and analysis. The curriculum includes courses in the principal fields of the discipline, including American and comparative government and politics, international relations, and political theory. Through coursework and independent study projects, students confront some of the enduring questions of politics while studying political institutions, processes, behavior, and theory. Internships in Washington on the D.C. study group combine rigorous analysis of politics and government with direct exposure to Congress, the national executive, political parties, interest groups, think tanks, and media. Similarly, study and internships in Geneva, Switzerland, on the department's other study group, provide students with the opportunity to travel widely in Europe and to become immersed in the world of international organizations. The honors colloquium, in addition, offers students the opportunity to conduct significant research under the supervision of a faculty member. Students who major in political science are likely to be well prepared for future careers or graduate study in such fields as law, public service, international affairs, business management, teaching, journalism, and many others.

These major challenges and their attempted ameliorations are analyzed in-depth. The course concludes by examining the practical and discursive ramifications of China's development model for Chinese society, world politics, and the philosophical search for alternative modernities.

POSC 331," - Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa   or  - Politics in Sub-Saharan Africa Provides an understanding of politics in 48 countries that constitute sub-Saharan Africa. Following the independence era of the early 1960s and 1970s, much of the sub-continent exploded into a seemingly endless cycle of violence underscored by military coups d'état and civil wars. Over the last decade, various conflicts subsided enough for some states to institute political and market reforms. Others remained stuck in the throes of economic stagnation, on the verge of disintegration and vulnerable to terrorist groups and drug runners who exploit their vast ungovernable territories. What explains the various transitions that some states have experienced in sub-Saharan Africa? Why did most states disintegrate in violence following the end of colonial rule? Drawing upon pre-colonial accounts and histories of state formation and the theoretical, methodological, and conceptual tools that various Africanists have used to analyze key events, this course offers answers to these and other important questions about political and socio-economic developments on the continent of Africa.

Second, even when these countries all share a past of colonial rule and a "peripheral" location in the international system, the economic differences within the countries of the region are staggering.

POSC 365," - Just War in Comparative Perspective   - Just War in Comparative Perspective Introduce students to a wide variety of ways of thinking about justice and warfare, across time, space, and religion. Using political science--rather than theology or philosophy--as the lens for inquiry emphasizes the role played by political power in the creation and transmission of these systems of value. Beginning with an exploration of the roots of Western Just War thinking in the ancient world (Greece, Rome, and Israel), the course explores traditional just war thinking in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Students delve into source texts, examining the evolution of just war thought in a historical and comparative context, and the course illustrates the ways in which concepts of justice may be contingent on both a society's religious/ethnical beliefs and its military capabilities. Finally, the course turns to contemporary scholarship to ask, is just war theory still relevant today? Modern just war responses to weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, and counter-insurgency warfare provide students the opportunity to apply these ancient theories to the modern world.

The overriding theme is how race has influenced American politics and, conversely, how certain political phenomena have shaped the development of race. The specific topics around which the course is organized include the following: the most enduring and predominant racial issue - racial inequality; competing explanations for the origins and continuance of racial inequality; leadership approaches and ideologies for redressing the race problem; mass political strategies for dealing with the problem; majority attitudes and opinions regarding racial issues (including racial inequality); and the comparative experience of non-black minorities. These topics, individually and collectively, represent the essence of racial politics. (AM)  Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: "
POSC 153," - Introduction to Comparative Politics (CO)   - Introduction to Comparative Politics (CO) Nearly 200 independent states coexist in the world today. Although they are all unique, political scientists study them in systematic ways, comparing them to discover fundamental political patterns that can help produce broadly applicable generalizations across different cultures and geographies. Themes such as democratic or authoritarian regime type, models of economic development, state institutions, civil society, and issues of national and ethnic identity all form important realms of inquiry for researchers engaged in the practice of comparative politics. This course introduces students to the principle themes and basic theories of comparative politics using examples from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America, including both authoritarian and unstable democratic countries.

Awards The Award for Excellence in Sociology and Anthropology — awarded by the department to a student on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework within the department. The Ramshaw Service Award — established by Warren C. and Molly Ramshaw. Warren Ramshaw taught in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology from 1961 to 1992. The award is presented to an undergraduate student in recognition of outstanding community service and academic achievement. Off-Campus Study Students are strongly encouraged to expand the scope of their academic experiences by studying off campus. SOAN faculty help guide each student toward the off-campus study experiences that complement and build on his or her overall course plan; we encourage students not to think of off-campus study as a semester-long break from Colgate but rather as a way to enhance on-campus course work. Students often use off-campus study as a way to collect data for use in senior seminar and honors projects. Since Anthropology majors are required to complete a fieldwork component as part of their coursework, off-campus study can often be a rewarding and useful way to fulfill this requirement. More information on off-campus study can be found on the Sociology and Anthropology web page. Transfer Credit The department will accept for major credit no more than two courses taken at another institution and no more than one course towards the minor.   2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

ANTH 350," - Theorizing Contemporary Cultures (Students are strongly encouraged to take this course in the junior year.)   - Theorizing Contemporary Cultures Anthropologists are philosophers of the social. With firm roots in classical social theory, anthropologists have always questioned the relationship of materiality and imagination in human culture, the dialectic of individual and social, the structures of power and authority, the pull of kinship and cosmology, and the cultural patterning of time, space, gender, and story. Anthropology trains our attention on big questions of comparative and global import, but seeks answers in concrete things that people do, say, and make. Anthropological theory thus rests on the empiricism of ethnography, archaeology, and material studies, and provides the questions that drive research. This course links contemporary theoretical work in the discipline with essential forerunner texts and projects. It also considers influential texts from theorists outside the discipline proper, recognizing that anthropology takes insights from many theoretical quarters, and in turn informs theoretical endeavors across the social sciences and humanities.

ANTH 361," - Ancient Environments and Human Legacies (MC)   - Ancient Environments and Human Legacies (MC) Many, if not most of today's geopolitical problems can be traced to how people interact with the environment. Warfare, globalization, market economies, food production, ethnic conflicts, and disease are all contingent on the relationship between human beings and their environments. This course focuses on the complexity and nuance of those relationships through both space and time by utilizing an archaeological perspective. While many academic fields now focus on topics relating to environments, archaeology works with a dataset that spans the entirety of human history. Such a dataset allows archaeological researchers to ask powerful and fundamental questions, such as: How do human societies respond to environmental change? Have human beings ever successfully found a balance between themselves and their natural world? What events created today's environmental challenges? What leads to the downfall of a society? This course will consider questions like these through various case-studies across the globe that deal with the diversity of human societies and the specific environments from which they emerged.

ANTH 372," - Anthropological Theory and Archaeological Praxis (MC)   - Anthropological Theory and Archaeological Praxis (MC) Examines the interplay between theoretical trends in anthropology and the emergence of a reflexive practice of archaeology. Formal archaeology in the U.S. was a latecomer to anthropology, appearing during the era of Franz Boas. Somewhat later, the field became methodologically standardized as a result of the New Deal. After World War II, Americanist archaeology became a battle ground for competing perspectives in anthropology, fueled in part by the appearance of the National Science Foundation. Today, archaeology in the United States and Europe confronts and integrates numerous new critiques and theoretical perspectives, many of which arrive from recent trends in anthropology and various disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Among the topics addressed are cultural evolutionary theory, geoarchaeology, postcolonial critiques, practice theory, embodiment theory, gender archaeology, critical theory, discourse analysis, and indigenous archaeologies. The overarching goal is to assess the state of the art in anthropological approaches to the production of knowledge in archaeology.

Students trace the development of long-distance trade, the origins of agriculture, the spread of early religious traditions, and the formation of the first cities and empires in South America. In addition to learning the cultural history of the Central Andes, students engage in contemporary debates including cultural tourism and the popularization of the Andean past; art markets, looting, and ownership of archaeological remains; and the relationship of present-day Andean communities to their material heritage.

These movements included an uprising to stop the advances of globalization, struggles to control resources, demands for dignity and recognition, and struggles against corporate environmental degradation. The apparent resurgence of Latin American indigenous politics is connected, in part, to global initiatives, like the work on what would become the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous politics in Latin America ultimately pose questions about customary, national, and international legal frameworks.

This course examines the social significance of these intersections of identity and community: What political, cultural, and religious conflicts and negotiations mark Muslim identity in the global age? Initial readings survey the colonial age, which forced the integration of Muslim communities into the global capitalist and state systems. With this foundation students then address specific conflicts and congruencies of contemporary Muslim identity in both the Muslim world and the West: between Islamic law and national-state laws; between local Islamic norms and transnational flows of media, persons, and products; between popular Islam and political power. How do these issues affect Muslims and their neighbors? How do they affect geopolitics? What is the present and future of the "global village"?

Moore, Moran (Director), Page, Roller, Simmons, Villarrubia The Africana and Latin American Studies (ALST) Program is an interdisciplinary program that studies the histories and cultures, both material and expressive, of the peoples of Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America, and of African Americans in the United States. It draws heavily from several disciplines in the arts and humanities (art, language, literature, music) and the social sciences (anthropology, archaeology, economics, geography, history, political science, and sociology), as well as educational studies, philosophy, psychology, religion, and writing and rhetoric. The program offers a major and a minor with four different emphasis: African, African American, Caribbean, and Latin American studies. United by a shared historical connection within the Atlantic world, Africans, African Americans (US), Latin Americans, and the peoples of the Caribbean provide rich opportunities for interdisciplinary and comparative studies. The program offers students the opportunity to study one particular group of people in relation to others in the wider Atlantic world. It examines the indigenous civilizations of these regions and studies the impact of migration, imperialism and colonialism, racism, nationalism, and globalization in shaping the lives, ideas, and cultural identities of their inhabitants. The major in Africana and Latin American studies consists of nine courses. Students concentrate in African studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, or Latin America studies. Each emphasis has a required introductory course, and all students are also required to take at least one approved course within the program from outside their own emphasis. Substitution of other appropriate or equivalent courses, independent studies, or special study groups for the requirements for each concentration may be possible, but must be approved by the Africana and Latin American Studies Program director. Transfer courses, field study, and one-time-only courses by visiting professors can be credited toward the major or minor only with approval of the program director. A minimum average GPA of 2.00 in the courses chosen to count toward the major or minor in Africana and Latin American studies is required for graduation. Majors in the Africana and Latin American Studies Program may not pursue a minor in the program. In the case of a double major, no more than two courses from the department or program of the second major may be counted for the ALST major, with the approval of the ALST director or respective coordinator. The relationship between students and the coordinator of each concentration is a vital one, and it is imperative that each major and minor meet with the appropriate coordinator at least once a semester to assess progress toward meeting graduation requirements. As with the major, the minor in Africana and Latin American studies allows the student to concentrate in African studies, African American studies, Caribbean studies, or Latin American studies. It consists of six courses, no more than one of which may also be counted toward a student's major. 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

The Arthur Schomburg Awards for Excellence in African Studies and in African American Studies — awarded by the program to the student with the highest grade point average in African / African American studies courses, to be used for the purchase of books related to this field of study. Honors and High Honors Majors may graduate with honors or high honors in Africana and Latin American studies. Qualifications for honors include, at graduation, a minimum overall average of 3.00, a major average of 3.30, and a successful defense before a designated faculty committee of an honors paper or project prepared under the direction of a member of the Africana and Latin American studies faculty. The committee that evaluates the final paper will be identified by the program director in consultation with the student and the student's faculty adviser. Prospective honors students should notify the appropriate coordinators of their intentions by the first week of October of the senior year. A student with a double major in Africana and Latin American studies and a second field may apply for honors in both areas by submitting and defending a paper in each. The paper topics may be related, but the focus and/or content of the two papers must differ substantially. Beyond the requirements for honors, high honors requires a major average of 3.7.

Emphasis in this course is on investigation. Familiarizes students with the methods, techniques, and language of social science research. Focusing on field and survey research, students examine the ways social scientists formulate questions, collect and analyze data, and present their findings. Also concerned with the epistemological underpinnings of "doing sociology." How do sociologists define "fact" and "truth"? What are the historical and contemporary debates over these concepts? To provide students with a hands-on understanding of concepts and issues, students are expected to collect and analyze original data. Students also do computer statistical analysis of pre-existing data bases.

Highlights of the trip include visits to the embassies of the African countries the Colgate team is representing, as well as engaging in debate with student representatives from over thirty colleges and universities across the country. The program is offered as a half-credit course,  - Movements for Social Justice in South Africa (Extended Study) Considers social movements in the specific context of South Africa, a country which has been transformed by and continues to experience large-scale civil society mobilizations. South Africa's unusual heritage of settler colonialism, enforced racial segregation, and explosive economic growth fueled by resources like gold and diamonds combine to make the country a perfect setting in which to investigate the efforts of diverse groups of citizens to achieve a more just and equitable society. Theoretical models drawn from sociology and anthropology expose how social movements originate, succeed, fail, and transform. These models are then applied to the specific history of South Africa, including the early development of non-violent protests, multi-racial labor movements, and the rise of the African National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups. In addition, the ongoing struggles for social justice since the democratic transition in 1994 are addressed, focusing particularly on movements for environmental justice, the rights of indigenous peoples, and access to adequate health care and schooling. New social media, art forms, and networking technologies that have transformed the ability of civil society groups to mobilize are also considered. The on-campus portion of the course is followed by a three-week extended study trip to two South African cities. As a final project, students use their experience to write a proposal for advanced research on a particular social movement.  Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: "

Better known in the United States as a tourist destination, the region has a rich but tragic history intimately connected with Euro-American imperialism and plantation slavery. Nevertheless, by bringing together people of widely diverse ethnicities from all over the world, the plantations became a virtual laboratory of socio-cultural engineering to produce some of the earliest and most complex multiracial societies. In conjunction with a study group that spends a semester at the University of the West Indies, ALST majors within the Caribbean concentration are exposed to a diverse range of issues relating to race relations, cultural identity, political governance, and economic development that are embedded in the history, literature, politics, and economies of the territories of the region.

ALST 201,"// - Africa An introduction to the interdisciplinary study of Africa and to the African Studies major and minor at Colgate. The goal is to introduce students to a major world area with which many, even highly educated, Westerners are unfamiliar. Africa is the original home of the human species, and the intellectual contributions of the continent and its people to the concept of a common humanity are tremendous, including agricultural and industrial technologies, artistic and aesthetic principles, and religious and philosophical ideas. Due to early patterns of globalization and European colonization in the western hemisphere, the Atlantic slave trade, and ultimately colonialism on the continent itself, Africa was configured as "the Dark Continent" in European discourses of the nineteenth century.

Home to an extraordinary range of linguistic and ethnic groups, this broad and dynamic region is rich in cultural and environmental diversity. Engaging the many changes taking place in Asian societies today requires a similarly diverse set of intellectual skills. To this end, the Asian Studies Program at Colgate integrates scholarly approaches spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences: from literature, art, and religion to history, politics, economics, and geography. The Asian studies major encourages students to undertake their own interdisciplinary explorations of this region. Awards The Award for Excellence in Area Studies (South Asia, China, Japan, Pan-Asia) — awarded by the program to students on the basis of outstanding academic performance in coursework taken within the major. Study Groups The Asian Studies Program strongly encourages majors to participate in Colgate study groups and in approved programs in India or other locations in Asia. Faculty of the program serve as directors of study-abroad programs in China, Japan, and Korea. For more information, see Off-Campus Study.

Kraly, Leventer, McCay, Meyer, Parks, Pattison, Tseng, Turner Colgate's Environmental Studies Program helps students to understand the complexity of environmental issues and to underscore the consequences and impacts of the human experience on the environment. Students in environmental studies learn to think, speak, and write clearly and articulately about environmental issues from a variety of perspectives. The environmental studies curriculum combines interdisciplinary breadth with depth in a chosen field of study. The Environmental Studies Program is an interdisciplinary program located within the Division of University Studies and staffed by faculty from a number of departments who apply their knowledge and expertise to teaching and research endeavors that cross disciplinary boundaries. The program administers five majors: environmental studies plus four departmentally affiliated majors including environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology. All five majors include a common set of courses that ensures a common interdisciplinary experience. Each student achieves depth in analytical ability by taking a specified set of courses, usually in a particular discipline, chosen in consultation with her or his adviser. To fulfill environmental studies graduation requirements, students must possess a minimum overall GPA of at least 2.00 in all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. Honors and High Honors Environmental studies majors wishing to pursue honors should consult with the environmental studies program director and a research sponsor no later than the spring of their junior year. Honors may be awarded to students majoring in environmental studies who accumulate a GPA of 3.30 in courses counted toward the major, and complete a semester-long independent research project under faculty guidance during enrollment in  - Korea Designed for students to explore the culture of Korea/Corea.

ENST 491," - Independent Study. Students pursuing honors will submit a proposal developed in consultation with an ENST-affiliated faculty member who will serve as research sponsor. The proposal describing the project will be submitted to the environmental studies steering committee in the fall semester of their senior year for approval. The research project should reflect the student's area of focus but must also demonstrate the understanding gained using an interdisciplinary perspective and approach. The Director of the program will normally serve as second reader to the honors project. Alternatively, the director and research sponsor may designate up to three faculty members to evaluate the merit of the work and report to the environmental studies steering committee. Students standing for honors will deliver an oral presentation to faculty and students of the program, and produce a report in a format most appropriate to the project. The environmental studies steering committee and the research sponsor must determine whether the oral presentation and report are of high quality and worthy of honors in the program. Students demonstrating exceptional commitment to research and meeting all the requirements for honors may be awarded high honors if the overall quality of their work is deemed to be outstanding by the environmental studies steering committee and research sponsor.

The major GPA is calculated from all courses counted toward the major, both ENST courses and those taken in other departments and programs. Honors and High Honors for Environmental Geology To be eligible for honors in environmental geology, students must complete the following requirements in addition to the environmental geology major: (1) Complete  - Seminar in Environmental Studies, (2) take four full-credit courses in mathematics, chemistry, physics, or biology, (3) complete a year-long senior thesis as described in the honors section of the geology major, and (4) achieve a minimum average GPA of 3.0 in the three 200-level core courses and 400-level capstone course. If additional courses are taken in these categories, the highest grades will be used to compute this GPA. Transfer Credit A maximum of two course credits transferred from other institutions may be applied toward the environmental studies major. One course credit transferred from another institution may be applied toward the environmental studies minor. If the requirement for Focus in a Particular Field of Study is waived because of a second major or minor, transfer credits contributing to the second major or minor do not count toward this maximum. Approved courses taken as part of Colgate sponsored study groups, such as the Australia study group affiliated with the Environmental Studies Program, are not considered transfer credits and do not count toward the maximum. In many cases, courses that might be applied toward the environmental studies major or minor will be approved for university credit by another department on campus. For example, an environmental economics course would be reviewed for credit by the economics department. Once approved for university credit, the course must be approved by the director of environmental studies for credit toward the major or minor. In some cases, a course might be approved for university credit as an environmental studies (ENST) course. Students must supply the director with a course description and syllabus to apply for transfer credit in these cases. Limits on the transfer of courses toward environmental biology, environmental economics, environmental geography, and environmental geology majors are determined by the biology, economics, geography, and geology departments, respectively, and are available in the affiliated department section in this chapter.

Through the study of history and theory, formal analysis, and production experiences, the program examines how film and media serve as powerful determinants of ideology, identity, and historical consciousness. Courses offered in a range of departments and programs constitute the major and minor, reflecting the fact that cinema and media-based research cuts across disciplines. It has been said that the mass media collectively represent the most important and widely shared context for the receipt of information and ideas in our contemporary experience. Courses in Film and Media Studies question the consequences of our passive consumption of mass media as both entertainment and information. Students learn the history and theory of film and media, analytical approaches and strategies; they also come to understand the various ways in which film and media are produced, circulated, and consumed locally, nationally, and globally. The film and media studies curriculum encompasses history, theory, and practice, with the goal of developing in students the critical skills necessary to analyze representation and experience as they are constructed by new and emerging visual technologies, and to put theoretical and historical knowledge into practice through media production courses and exercises. Awards The Film and Media Studies Award — awarded for outstanding achievement in film and media studies. Honors and High Honors The award of honors in film and media studies is dependent on faculty evaluation of work done in the  - Community-based Study of Environmental Issues This project-based, interdisciplinary course examines current environmental issues in the context of community-based learning. Topics for investigation are selected by faculty, usually in conjunction with the campus sustainability coordinator, the Upstate Institute, or directly with local and regional agencies or organizations.

ENST 344," - Managing Complexity: America's Public Lands   - Managing Complexity: America's Public Lands Public land management is inherently complex. Typically there are multiple interested parties and potentially competing goals such as wilderness preservation, recreational accessibility, and resource exploitation. Also, the management of public lands may rest with several agencies. Management decisions made in pursuit of one goal often have implications for other goals, stakeholders, and management agencies. Complexity theory offers a new perspective for understanding the complicated workings of ecosystems, economies, and political systems. Such complex adaptive systems are characterized by feedback loops, chaos, nonlinear dynamics, self-organization, and emergence. The aims of this course are to investigate alternative public land management strategies and apply complexity theory 1) to model qualitatively the intricacies of both natural and human-built systems, 2) to propose and evaluate fresh ecological strategies and management policies for conserving public lands, and 3) to investigate new procedures for mitigating tension among competing interests in the use of public land.

Fossil fuels, which were deposited on Earth over hundreds of millions of years, will largely be exhausted over the course of just a few hundred years. Global climate change makes our situation even more unsustainable—we need to stop using fossil fuels long before they run out if we want to avoid catastrophic environmental change. This course takes a quantitative approach to learning about our current energy use, so that students can understand how our personal choices and lifestyles affect energy use. Discussion includes how our energy needs are met in the future through renewable resources: what technologies are available now, what are their costs, and how much energy can they provide.

Unfortunately, many citizens in our society do not understand the fundamentals of these environmental problems. This course -- designed for students without experience in other university-level science courses -- explores the chemistry behind some of our more pressing environmental dilemmas. Topics include some consequences of fossil fuel combustion (the greenhouse effect, acid rain, urban smog), the ozone hole, nuclear energy/wastes, and ground water contamination. The emphasis is on the science behind these problems, what we know about how the problems have come about, and what we can do, if anything, to ease the problems. This course is for the student who has not taken college-level chemistry, but is concerned about our threatened environment.

ENST 324," - Hunting, Eating, Vegetarianism   - Hunting, Eating, Vegetarianism Historically, hunting for food has represented one of the most direct ways in which people have engaged with nature. Some scholars even believe that the "hunting instinct" is a fundamental aspect of human identity. People in modern industrialized societies, however, often have little idea about the origins of the flesh they consume, most of which is raised and slaughtered on an industrial-scale. While the majority continue to eat meat, poultry, and/or fish, a minority have chosen to become locavores, vegetarians, or even vegans for ethical, religious, cultural, health-oriented, or environmental reasons. Others continue to hunt and fish but within ecosystems dramatically altered by human intervention and amidst cultural landscapes complicated by commercialized and trophy hunting. Drawing upon a wide range of sources including literature, artistic and documentary films, works of popular culture, autobiographical accounts, online hunting (and anti-hunting) forums, diverse web resources, self-reflective essays, and scholarly approaches ranging from animal studies to humanistic ecocriticism, this course investigates the intertwined themes of hunting, 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

Until the 1960s, Christian thinkers considered it the great glory of Christianity that it alone among the world's religions had permitted purely secular science to develop in a civilization in which it was dominant. After several centuries of an ever-increasing eclipse of the religious significance of nature in the West and neglect of the order of nature, humans are now experiencing environmental crisis: global warming; the destruction of the ozone layer; climatic and weather pattern changes; soil erosion; death of animals, birds, and marine life; and the disappearance of some plant species. Today the very fabric of life is threatened and the future of our world hangs in the balance as nature is threatened by destruction caused by an environmental crisis that has gone unchecked for several centuries. What can be learned from religions of the world that will save humanity and nature? What is the relationship between religion, nature, science, and technology? Discussions include views from various religious traditions concerning nature, concept of the human, notions of progress and destiny, faith and science, ecological theology, ecofeminism, justice and sustainability, and spirituality.

Film and mass media can be powerful determinants of ideology, identity, and historical consciousness. This course is a historical survey of media technologies and environments, combining course readings with a required weekly film screening. The theoretical concepts introduced in this course enable students to critically approach the visual culture around them: just how immersed are we in the virtual, and what are the strategies for engaging with or disengaging from virtual worlds? Students learn to respond to film and media as proactive, critical, and articulate viewers. Students also acquire the vocabulary, conceptual strategies, and interpretive skills necessary to closely analyze the form and content of film and media, as well as the ability to set their own relation to the ideologies all representations convey.

In response to the shocks of modernity, ruptures, scientific advancements, and philosophical ideas and challenges, Jewish thinkers, culture, and individuals formulated responses—religious and otherwise. In Experiencing Judaism, students will explore how Judaism has responded to modernity, the "age of secularism." To wit, students will focus on distinctively modern expressions of Judaism: the range of denominations, their historical origins, ideologies, and attitudes to Jewish law and its development, secularism, religious and secular Zionism. Students will explore these developments through primary texts within their historical contexts to better understand contemporary Judaism as it is expressed and practiced, mainly in North America and Israel, as a religion and also as a culture.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

JWST 213,"/ The Bible as/and Literature     - The Bible as/and Literature What role does literary art play in the shaping of biblical narrative? How does the construction of the sacred text reflect its theological meaning? The religious vision of the Bible is given depth and subtlety precisely by being conveyed literarily; thus, the primary concern in this course is with the literature and literary influence of the received text of the Bible rather than with the history of the text's creation.

JWST 303," - Jewish Fiction before the War (in English)   - Jewish Fiction before the War   - Jewish Fiction before the War Focused on the great novels and short stories written by European Jews before the Holocaust. All of the writers--even Kafka, whose fictional world is non-Jewish--reflect a Jewish consciousness and a Jewish confrontation with modernity. Modernity in these works takes different and often conflicting forms. In some works it is revolution (the promise of communism as a solution to the Jewish question); in other work, emigration, Zionism, or radical assimilation to the surrounding culture, what that happens to be. Several books--most prominently those of Sholem Aleichem, Agnon, and Kafka--take up the question of God's justice. Several books deal with the loss of identity. A variety of 20th-century themes (political radicalism, bourgeois desires and bourgeois impurity, a desire to uproot and a search for roots) run through the texts, always in different combinations.

What existential and ideological factors give rise to convictions of the world's cataclysmic destruction, or civilization-altering fate? Why do apocalyptic movements forecast the inevitability of such life-threatening catastrophes as national or global revolution and warfare, plagues, ecological catastrophes, or profound existential threats from bioengineering or artificial intelligence menaces gone awry? Particular attention is focused on the sociohistorical factors that fuel and heighten apocalyptic fervor within discrete historical periods, inclusive of contemporary post-apocalyptic reconstructions of new world orders that inspire allegiance, hope, and notions of paradisal tranquility.

Sexuality offers a critical lens to analyze communities, cultures, and subcultures; institutions, discourses, and literatures; economic and political movements; the social construction of power, status, and hierarchies; and identity categories configured on the basis of age, ability, class, ethnicity, gender, race, and religion. Moreover, sexuality is considered as the subject of biological, medical, and psychological research. LGBT studies is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary minor that emphasizes the application of new theories and methodologies (e.g., queer, feminist, critical race, and multicultural theories) to established disciplines as it promotes the generation of new knowledge within traditional fields. Through the minor, students gain critical understandings of normative categorization, query unspoken assumptions, examine social stratification and distributions of power, and explore the diversity of forms that sexuality has taken historically and in contemporary contexts.

This course considers transnational conceptualizations and circulations associated with gender or sexual nonconformity. In doing so, it emphasizes ways of interrogating queer citizenship that purposefully attend to dynamics exemplifying complex interactions on global and local scales.

Constitutional theories such as equal protection, privacy, due process, liberty interests, and states' rights are applied to issues such as consensual sodomy, same-sex marriage, LGBTQ parenting, employment rights, military policy, and freedoms of public school students. The power of the U.S. Supreme Court to shape laws concerning LGBTQ issues not only for the present society but for future generations is also examined. Cases studied are supplemented with secondary works. These works include writings by traditional legal scholars as well as works by feminists, race-based scholars, and queer theorists to create a fuller perspective. Through this exploration into the legal reality of a marginalized group, students see how the U.S. legal system continues to evolve in its struggle to provide equality for all of its citizens.

LGBT 355," - Partners and Crime: Queer Outlaws in Literature and Film   - Partners and Crime: Queer Outlaws in Literature and Film An intersection of sexuality and legality in literature and film. Beginning with topics of LGBTQ activism, homosociality and homonormativity, students will analyze how certain bodies and sexualities come to be on the right or wrong side of the law and how these sexual norms are quite literally policed. Focus will shift to literary writings and films from artists whose queer protagonists choose not to seek acceptance but rather to move outside of the law. Through bank robbery, border crossing, terrorism and homicide, these figures threaten not only the sexual order but also structures of class, race, and national security. Students will inquire into the true nature of these crimes, and determine how their crimes are sexualized and their sexualities criminalized. These will be analyzed together with critical works on queer and dissident genders and sexualities. The course may vary between semesters to focus on different regions or periods.

POSC 415," - Seminar: Social Justice Politics and Policy   - Seminar: Social Justice Politics and Policy Focuses on the issues and problems confronting certain socially and politically marginalized groups in contemporary American society. Such groups include racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, women, and gays and lesbians. Of particular concern is how well these groups have fared in the American political arena, the sources of and constraints upon their political clout, and the political system's response to their concerns and demands. Students examine both the political process as it pertains to marginalized groups and also the major public policy developments affecting these groups. More specifically, students utilize traditional political science tools and methodologies in an attempt to disentangle the dynamic interplay between American political process, public policy, and the politics of social justice.

RELG 313," - The "Word" in the World: The Bible in Global Perspective   - The "Word" in the World: The Bible in Global Perspective   - The "Word" in the World: The Bible in Global Perspective   - The "Word" in the World: The Bible in Global Perspective Using a form of biblical interpretation called contextual interpretation, this course explores how the Bible is read and interpreted by people around the world. Contextual interpretation takes the context or social location of the interpreter (their gender, class, race, nationality, etc.) as the starting point in the hermeneutical (interpretive) process. De-centering the predominantly male, patriarchal, and first-world orientation of more traditional biblical scholarship, the readings for this course foreground the perspectives and commitments of the interpreters as well as issues of identity, ethnicity, gender, class, location, and power.

ANTH 221," - Kinship and Marriage   - Kinship and Marriage   - Kinship and Marriage   - Kinship and Marriage What is family? What is kinship? What is marriage? These are questions that have been central to anthropology since its inception in the 19th century. This course examines the culture and political economy of family life, kinship, and marriage in a broad range of human societies, ranging from small-scale communities to highly industrialized states. In addition to looking at the theories, methods, and data that are relevant to the study of kinship in anthropology and related disciplines, the class analyzes and compares different systems of descent and inheritance; various types of households, marriage patterns, and networks of exchange; and the myriad ways in which systems of kinship and marriage are informed by ideologies of gender and vice versa. The class also evaluates some of the recent classics on kinship in America as well as selected aspects of contemporary theoretical debates bearing on kinship and class, lesbian and gay kinship, and the new reproductive technologies.

Students will study how the colonial discourses that shaped the earliest modern Puerto Rican imaginary continues to inform current political discourse. Through the study of a wide-ranging body of Puerto Rican work that includes literature, cinema, history, and politics, students seek answers to how national identity is articulated in a colonial context, how migration to the mainland has altered the cultural landscape and what kinds of collective cultural and political movements have emerged in response to the island's socio-economic and political problems. Focused on issues of gender and sexuality to understand how these, along with issues of race and class today are linked to the island's colonial legacy, in order to develop a framework for understanding the complex relationships between nation, gender and race on the island and within Puerto Rican communities in the U.S.  Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: No Junior, Senior Area of Inquiry: None Liberal Arts CORE: Communities & Identities "

Nakhimovsky Advisory Committee Aveni, Campbell, Davies, Garland, Hirata (Director), Kelly, A.D. Nakhimovsky, Ries, Stolova, Witherspoon This academic minor focuses on the rigorous study of language from the perspectives of several contributing disciplines: the study of a specific language or language group in its contemporary condition or historical development; classical philology; philosophy; psychology and neuroscience; acoustic analysis; computer science. Students pursuing a minor in linguistics will encounter a wide variety of methodologies: careful data collection and classification, rigorous philosophical analysis, sociological surveys, psychological experiments, ethnographic and ethnolinguistic methodologies, and the writing of computer programs to analyze and interpret language data. The themes addressed by the linguistics minor include the sounds of language; word structure and etymology; styles and dialects; syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of language; language acquisition by children and adults; language in society; language and culture, historical development and language families; language and mind; language and the brain; language processing by computer; psychological perspectives on language. Linguistics minors will give a presentation in the last semester of their senior year showing how their study of linguistics has informed their understanding of the world and the academic disciplines they have studied. The presentation can be based on a paper or papers they will have written in their linguistics-related courses. Students pursuing the linguistics minor are strongly encouraged to undertake a capstone experience. This might consist of an independent study, a thesis presented at the annual end-of-year event, or both. Consult the department for faculty that may supervise the capstone experience.

CORE 115S," - Language Acquisition   - Language Acquisition Explores how infants and adults acquire native and foreign languages. What goes on in the brains of new-born infants before they discover the meanings of words? What might be the linguistic and social consequence of acquiring an English dialectal accent, distinguishing or not distinguishing between Mary, merry, and marry? Why do some adults succeed in learning a second language, while others do not? Why are some Japanese unable to tell the difference between rice and lice? When a girl had no contact with a language speaking community, is she able to acquire her first language after puberty? Are bonobo chimpanzees able to learn human language? Students read books and articles that address these issues, watch films and have some direct experience of learning a difficult second language. Physiological, linguistic, psychological, and social factors that determine whether one succeeds or fails to acquire native and foreign languages are discussed.

To answer this question this course explores the interrelation between verbal expression and such cognitive faculties as bodily experience, imagination, memory, categorization, and abstract thought. The study of language as a cognitive phenomenon is a relatively new discipline. It originated in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Since then, cognitive linguistics has been a rapidly growing field that has both benefited from and contributed to its allied disciplines of cognitive psychology, cognitive anthropology, and cognitive neuroscience. The course begins by examining the advantages and shortcomings of the cognitive perspective on the different levels of language (e.g., sounds, words, sentences, texts, etc.). Students explore the connections of cognitive linguistics with the related fields that are broadly referred to as the "cognitive sciences." No background in linguistics is required, but interest in linguistics is expected.

Only one course from the Other Courses list may be an independent study course. Advanced Language Courses Advanced language courses taken abroad on a study group also qualify with approval by the director.   - Linguistics: Data, Theory, and Experiments Language is by far the most important means of communication among humans and the central cognitive ability separating them from the rest of the animal kingdom. Linguistic activity is all-pervasive and forms the foundation of all other high-level symbolic activities. At the same time, many aspects of this activity remain deeply mysterious. How did the language ability come about? Why is it that children learn their first language with such ease, while most adults have great difficulties learning a second one? How is it possible to learn such a complex set of rules in such a short time, on the basis of a very small corpus of data, much of it grammatically incorrect? These and other questions form the subject matter of the field of linguistics and are explored in this course.

Women's studies recognizes the complexity of human lives as gender interconnects with sexuality, race, class, ability, nationality, ethnicity, religion, and age in the constitution of experience and identities. It thus seeks to provide insights which lead one beyond older and more exclusionary theories and practices. The program is at its core interdisciplinary, integrating knowledge from different disciplines to encourage critical engagement with all forms of experience from a feminist standpoint. Interdisciplinary study leads students to question frameworks, concepts, and methods, enabling them to understand better both the past and the contemporary world, while envisioning a future beyond traditional roles and inequities. By emphasizing interdisciplinarity, the program seeks to help students acquire the tools to analyze critically the societal, cultural, global, and personal issues that shape their lives and challenge them to look at these issues from multiple perspectives. It also encourages them to reflect on the ways in which knowledge is produced within different and oftentimes unrecognized systems of oppression, and to examine categories that are presented as natural and permanent in their cultural and historical context. Finally, the program strives to help students acquire the skills of critical analysis and imagine alternatives that challenge the naturalizing of inequalities. Consonant with the goal of promoting new theoretical frameworks, the related and emerging field of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer studies provides the basis for an independent minor affiliated with the Women's Studies Program. Honors and High Honors Students who qualify and choose to work toward honors in women's studies should announce their intention to do so by submitting proposals preceding their final term of study at Colgate. During the final term, honors candidates register for  - Advanced Russian Reading, discussion, and writing in Russian. Texts will be from contemporary online sources.

Although language is considered as primarily serving communication in its advanced form, it is also an important vehicle for thought, with the potential to extend, refine, and direct thinking. The interaction of language with other cognitive abilities is the central focus of the course. Students compare the communication systems of other species with human language, examine efforts to teach human language to apes, learn how psycholinguists conceptualize and investigate language-mind relationships, and inquire into the cognitive abilities of various types of language users, such as bilinguals and deaf and hearing signers. Attention also is given to evolutionary changes in the neural structures implicated in human language and to neural processes constraining the developmental course of language acquisition.

Recognizing that the United States is not just a multicultural society but a multilingual one, the course investigates how urban American youth have "talked back" to power and seized the power to name. It focuses in particular on uses of the Hip Hop vernacular by urban Latin Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, and white Americans to give voice to their reality and the urban struggle. The course also traces the causes and consequences of historical silences, as suggested by Martin Luther King's dictum: "A riot is the language of the unheard."

Guile Professors Cerasano, Davies, Staley Senior Lecturer Tomlinson  Advisory Committee Cerasano, Cooper, Davies, Godwin, C. Guile (Director), Luciani, Staley, Stevens The Medieval and Renaissance studies (MARS) minor enables students to explore the richness and variety of civilization from the late Roman era through the Renaissance and Reformation. Broadly interdisciplinary, it is intended as a supplement to traditional majors. Spanning the arts and humanities and social sciences, MARS covers history, art, literature, music, philosophy, science, and religion from the 4th to the 17th centuries. Chronological parameters define the Middle Ages as beginning with the rise of Christianity in the 4th-century Roman Empire. The Renaissance encompasses the humanism of 15th-century Italy, the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, and its aftermath in the 17th-century Counter-Reformation. Because of the difficulty of assigning absolute chronological limits to these diverse periods, some courses necessarily include material that crosses these boundaries; moreover, the emphasis in MARS is on creating interdisciplinary bridges across the curriculum, and the program is structured in a way that encourages students to explore a cross section of traditional fields. To this end, MARS courses can center on a topic area proposed by the student and agreed upon in consultation with a faculty adviser. However, courses in the minor should complement each other. Students may elect to minor in either the medieval or Renaissance period or in a combination of both. In order to declare a minor, prospective students must write a statement of purpose (at least one page), explaining how the choice of courses in their minor will coalesce. This should normally be submitted to the program director by the spring term of the junior year. In order to take full advantage of course offerings and advising, students are urged to enroll in the program as early as possible in their undergraduate career.

Additional courses (notably topical seminars) may be accepted upon petition. It is the responsibility of the student to recognize that certain courses might require departmental prerequisites for which he or she would not necessarily receive credit toward the MARS minor. Only one independent study course and only one non-Colgate course will be counted toward the minor. Courses that are appropriate for the MARS minor are sometimes offered as part of the university's Venice study group program. At least three courses should be at the intermediate level and at least one should be at the 400 (seminar) level — either an existing seminar or an independent research paper. Senior seminars and honors thesis courses in any department could provide a place for the student's capstone experience. One year's study of Latin at Colgate is recognized as one course toward the minor. While there is no mandated language requirement, it is strongly recommended that students considering graduate school in a medieval or Renaissance field should study Latin at least through the intermediate level. Students are encouraged to explore early literature in Old and Middle English, as well as early period courses in the foreign language departments. Courses from the following list are appropriate for the MARS minor:   - Language and Gender   2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

Students consider the following questions in depth: To what extent does English have a sexist, or patriarchal bias? Do women and men speak differently in our culture? Do they think differently? What is the difference between gender and sexuality in language use? To what extent should writing avoid gender-specific forms, and to what extent should classrooms honor gender differences in language use? What is "political correctness" in language and what is its value? Students look at English from theoretical, political, and social viewpoints, with readings taken from a wide range of fields, but with a particular focus on linguistics and feminist theory.

HIST 241," - Tudor - Stuart Britain (EU)   - Tudor - Stuart Britain (EU) In 1485, Henry Tudor became king of England. A second-rate power in Europe, his kingdom had been torn apart by dynastic struggles and civil war. By 1714, when the last of the Stuart monarchs died, everything had changed. England was now part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, which included Scotland and Wales, and whose king also ruled over the neighboring island of Ireland. The medieval feudal kingship had been replaced by a well-established parliamentary monarchy, with many stops along the way. Britain was now a world power, at the center of a far-flung empire, and competing with France for dominance in Europe and beyond. This course will explore precisely how these monumental changes came about, taking a close look at British history over the long 16th and 17th centuries from a number of different perspectives: political, religious, social, cultural, commercial, and intellectual.

The great themes articulated by Luther, Calvin, and others constituted a challenge to established authority that involved the Church, the monarchies, and the dissenters. The Protestant tradition that emerged gave rise to new conceptions of political order that profoundly impacted the ideological, social, and political foundations of the United States. Protestant vision contributed heavily to biblical metaphors shaping American self-understanding. Protestant vision and Protestant thinkers gave rise to various forms of Christian communities, such as the Society of Shakers, and provided the impetus for reform movements such as abolition of slavery, the Social Gospel, Prohibition, and the Civil Rights movement.

CORE 185C," - The Sahara   - The Sahara   or  - The Sahara The Sahara has loomed large in the Western imagination yet it has rarely been understood on its own terms. The Sahara's role in world history has been framed as a bridge or a barrier, the dividing line between Arab and African Africa. Such framings obscure the agency of the people in the Sahara and the land itself. This course explores the relationship between imagination and imperialism in the Sahara, problematizing the idea of objective and disinterested knowledge about the Other — other peoples, other places, and other histories. The central themes of this course are power, racism, and imperialism, which are examined through theories of Orientalism; neocolonialism and world systems theory; post-colonialism and subaltern studies; as well as feminist, gendered, and queer studies approaches.

CORE 177C," - Peru (L)   - Peru The Latin American country Peru evokes dramatic and conflicting images of spectacular natural settings, ancient ruins, cosmopolitan cities, shantytowns, street children, poverty and more. It is a country of extremes. This course offers an interdisciplinary inquiry into this ecologically and culturally diverse land. The course begins by exploring the distinct geography and ecology of the central Andean region (rainforest, mountains, desert, and ocean) in order to understand how these features have shaped the societies that inhabit the region of present-day Peru. This involves analyzing the evolution and organization of Pre-Columbian societies, paying special attention to the Inca civilization. It also examines the ideologies, institutions and practices introduced with the Spanish conquest and era of colonialism in order to understand their impact on indigenous society and their relevance to the state of underdevelopment that characterizes contemporary Peru. Study of present-day Peru juxtaposes rural and urban life, the ties between the two spheres, and the crisis conditions that enveloped both ways of life until recently. Specific issues include the internal armed conflict, the coca culture and cocaine economy, shantytowns and land invasions, oil extraction and indigenous resistance, among other compelling issues. Throughout the term, this course emphasizes the many paradoxes of this intriguing land.

One of the greatest writers of the 19th century, Dostoevsky was obsessed both with the social injustice he saw in czarist Russia and with humanity's eternal struggle between good and evil, religious faith and atheism, rationality and irrationality, sexual lust and purity. One of the characters in The Brothers Karamazov exclaims, "God and Satan are at war and the battleground is the human soul," and Dostoevsky seems to have shared this conviction. In this course students read a variety of Dostoevsky's fictional works, as well as selections from his diaries and journalism in a shared quest to unravel his complexity as a man and as a writer.

With roots in ancient Greece and branches in the most recent media technologies, rhetoric is simultaneously one of the oldest and newest academic disciplines, fundamentally engaged by dynamic relationships between language, power, and public culture. As a discipline, rhetoric demonstrates how discourse generates knowledge, mediates power, and enacts social change; as an art, rhetoric enables the speaker/writer to invent arguments by making logical, ethical, and emotional appeals to an audience. The department offers courses in writing, public address, and the history and theory of rhetoric and language. Courses in writing and rhetoric position students to become critical language users, preparing them to be effective communicators both in their future careers and in civic society, in the US and abroad. The Writing Requirement On the basis of standardized writing and verbal test scores, some first-year students first priority in registering for writing courses. These students are required to complete one of the department's eligible 100-level writing courses with a grade of C or better.

PCON 260," - Gender in Conflict and Peace   - Gender in Conflict and Peace   - Gender in Conflict and Peace Aims to make a feminist sense of contemporary wars and conflicts. Students trace the gendered processes of defining citizenship, national identity and security, and examine the role of the military in the construction of femininity and masculinity. One of the most prominent social constructions of gender is that of the male provider/warrior and the female caregiver/peacemaker. The making of war depends in large part on the maintenance of this simplistic conceptualization. In addition, the inequalities and power imbalances that lead to situations of conflict, at both macro- and micro-levels, reflect and reinforce the structural and discursive inequality between men and women. The class is interdisciplinary and gives equal weight to theory and practice while drawing on writings by local and global theorist and activists.

How have gendered assumptions influenced philosophical views about what knowledge is and how knowledge is best pursued?  What roles, if any, should considerations of gender play in our theories of knowledge? In addition to these general questions, students address issues in feminist philosophy of science, specifically issues concerning the scientific study of sexual differences in behavior and brain structure. The role of testimony in the transmission of knowledge is also considered. Feminist epistemologists and philosophers of language have explored ways in which gender affects the assessment of testimony as trustworthy. Patterns of acceptance of testimony matter for how the claims people make—in law courts and elsewhere—are heard (or not) by others. Concludes by considering what this means for the proper philosophical treatment of testimony about personal experience.

By studying women who composed and embodied what is now understood as the early years of the first wave of U.S. feminism, students access a genealogy of women rhectors who serve as exemplars - and cautions - for later waves and for their own contemporary visions of social change. By positioning the study of rhetoric as the study of language as it constitutes social relations, power, and knowledge, students become more acutely aware of and fluent in the composition, circulation, and criticism of private and public discourses, the verbal material through which they construct social worlds. The work for this course requires close reading and active discussion of course texts through a rhetorical lens and through the category of gender. This course does not meet the writing requirement.

The course will provide an overview of how material remains are used for understanding social identities in the past. It will review feminist critiques of archaeology and how feminism has impacted the discipline of archaeology. Students examine archaeological resources for gendering the past (burials, art, artifacts) and explore gender in a range of prehistoric cultural contexts (hunter-gatherers, farmers, states, and empires) using archaeological case studies as examples. Students additionally look at the ways in which historical archaeology has helped to better understand gender relations in historical contexts. Students critically examine how gender and identity have been represented in academic research, museums, and popular media, in order to deconstruct modem-day assumptions about gender. Case studies derive from the earliest human origins, ancient complex civilizations, and recent colonial America.

Human lives are characterized by both continuity and change, and each human must negotiate the path of his or her life through a web of institutional networks. These pre-existing frameworks through which individuals travel are subject to the constraints of the past but are also open to possibilities created by each new generation.

WRIT 102," - Introduction to Rhetoric in the Liberal Arts Tradition   - Introduction to Rhetoric in the Liberal Arts Tradition Artes liberales--the liberal arts--those arts that are proper for a free citizen, according to Cicero. These arts numbered seven in the medieval curriculum, the language arts--grammar, logic, and rhetoric--constituting the first three or trivium. While the trivium has all but disappeared in today's college curriculum, increasingly scholars across the disciplines are discovering the integral role rhetoric plays in equipping citizens for effective participation in a democracy. Drawing upon the liberal arts tradition, the aim is to cultivate students' capacity for eloquence through inquiry. To foster this human impulse to inquire, students will engage in a number of inquiry projects that will ask them to reflect on their personal experiences, to analyze the forces that shaped those experiences, and to look critically at the way that social and cultural identity is formed. In conjunction with the three inquiry projects, students engage in an intense amount of work on rhetorical invention (the discovery of ideas for writing), composing a workable draft, reading and revising the draft, and rereading and editing it for fluency in grammar, punctuation, and style. The course fulfills the writing requirement.

A number of students, and many more professionals, hold jobs here that require speaking and writing on behalf of Colgate University. This course samples these writings as both theme and organizing principle, forming a textbook of practical rhetoric. It trains students in the analysis of texts through traditional rhetorical questions: What intellectual claims are made? What values are attributed to Colgate? What audiences are addressed? In writing their own texts about Colgate's current issues, students learn important speaking, writing, and reading strategies. In a sequence of expository essays, students develop new powers of persuasion by studying the interaction of language, point of view, and local cultural knowledge. The course meets the writing requirement.

Special attention is paid to problems arising from more complex critical analysis, such as appropriate ways to treat conflicting sources, detecting the biases in both primary and secondary source material, and examining the biases of the student's own arguments.

WRIT 205," - Writers and Readers   - Writers and Readers Focuses on one of the most important characteristics of a successful writer: the ability to, first, imagine a reader's point of view, and second, to establish an imaginary dialogue with that reader. The more the imagined reader anticipates the response of a real reader, the more power the writer can command. Students consider the following topics in depth: the split in the writer's self - creator and editor; automatic language - the clichéd medium of conscious life; the practice of self-paraphrase to get beyond the automatic; the development of the writer's potential voices; control over real readers; the imagined reader in the writer's head; and alienation and authority in college-level writing. To accomplish the goal of developing awareness and control of the relationship between writer and reader, students establish a writing community that works primarily with rough drafts in a workshop format. Principles of helpful feedback/response are taught explicitly, and learning to be a supportive but critical reader improves the students' editing skills at the same time that it models the realities of a reader's difficulties in the hands of an unskilled but developing writer.

WRIT 215," - Public Speaking   - Public Speaking Since the origins of western democracy, rhetoricians have taught the study and practice of public speaking as an essential art of public life and civic responsibility. This course fuses theory to praxis in introducing students to basic public speaking skills, including researching, organization, and writing effective oral presentations; developing skills of critical listening and audience analysis; surveying key examples of public address; and providing students the opportunity to work in different speech situations. Students develop poise and self-confidence in public speaking as they deepen their understanding of the evolving aesthetics of public discourse in the context of new media and global cultures.

WRIT 250," - Kairos: The Art of Rhetoric from Ancient to Modern Times   - Kairos: The Art of Rhetoric from Ancient to Modern Times Rhetoric--the effective use of language to persuade a given audience--is as old as human speech itself. Yet attuned as they were to "kairos," the opportune time of a fledgling democracy in Athens, the ancient Greeks were perhaps the first to codify rhetorical practice as an art. This is a course about time, about the art of rhetoric as a most effective medium of change at the right time. Students see this when rhetoric served as a vehicle for change in 5th-century Greece, when it equipped individuals to write and preach to effect change in the so-called dark ages, and when it gave women and former slaves the voice to change attitudes and institutions in the 19th and 20th centuries. Students survey the entire history of western rhetoric from the earliest treatises to the most recent theories. In addition to examining this history through a close reading of canonical texts, students come to know the rhetorical tradition through experience, by engaging in the very practices (e.g., medieval preaching and letter writing, and 18th-century exercises in elocution) associated with rhetoric in a particular historical period. The many rhetorical terms, concepts, principles, and practices covered in the course provide students the proper background for further study in the more specialized areas of rhetoric.

Many of the works that call on the Bible for inspiration are not of a religious nature at all, raising questions about the nature of biblical style. Readings range from the Venerable Bede and Queen Elizabeth I to Bob Marley and Douglas Rushkoff, in addition to source material from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament.

WRIT 280," - Rhetorical "Borderlands": Introduction to Comparative Intercultural Rhetoric   - Rhetorical "Borderlands": Introduction to Comparative Intercultural Rhetoric By taking a transnational comparative perspective, this course introduces students to several key questions in comparative and intercultural rhetoric, from the most basic question of "How does culture shape language, and how does language, in turn, shape culture?" to more complicated questions: How do cross-border and cross-cultural engagements constrain and influence rhetorical practices and interactions? How do cultural logics, values, and assumptions hierarchically govern different geo-political spaces? In what ways have individuals and groups both conformed to and resisted discursive structures of power and privilege? And finally, in what ways can comparative and intercultural study sharpen our own critical insights about and rhetorical agency within such dominant structures? This course will address these questions and others as students work to develop and strengthen skills in critical analysis, research, and reflective practices through the lens of transnational comparative intercultural rhetoric. 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

WRIT 315," - Public Address   - Public Address The study of public address has long been considered the cornerstone of a liberal arts education - meant to prepare graduates for success in public life as citizens, community members, and professionals. Students will examine public discourse on a relevant theme while familiarizing themselves with key debates regarding the theory and criticism of public address. Following that, students will engage in their own rhetorical criticism, as well as participating in speech and dialogue exercises that draw on rhetorical principles. As students immerse themselves in the history, criticism, and performance of public address, they will also consider how rhetorical dynamics inform issues of democracy and citizenship, especially as those issues relate to differences of ethnicity, race, class, and gender.

People often assume that new media is a 20th-century development, but this course will be a more historicized view; the printing press, after all, changed media more fundamentally than anything since. Starting with a foundation of media theory and narrative theory, the course will then work through the ages: printing; newspapers; color printing; radio; television; electronic fiction; fan fiction; hypertext; remix aesthetics; and videogames.

WRIT 342," - Rhetoric in Black and White: Communication and Culture in Conflict   - Rhetoric in Black and White: Communication and Culture in Conflict In the nearly 400-year history of social relations between Blacks and Whites in America, rhetoric has often failed. Civil war, Jim Crow, Civil Rights, and Black Power were all actions or movements that ensued largely because words fell short of persuading persons of good will to submit to reasoned arguments. Arguably a pillar of American democracy (as in the freedom to speak and to dissent), why has rhetoric been so seemingly ineffective in securing mutual respect and understanding between America's Black and White citizens? This course seeks to answer this question by closely examining the styles of communication that historically have shaped the cultural identities and public personas of the two groups. From slave speech to the languages of protest in the 1960s to verbal expression in rap music and social media today, the course considers why communication or dialogue involving race is often doomed to fail.

Whiteness is a rhetorical construct that exists only in discourse, yet its concrete effects impact societies all over the globe. Drawing on texts from around the world, students trace the evolution of this construct from its inception up to the present day, examining the rhetorical strategies whereby whiteness is both hidden and revealed in a variety of genres: personal memoirs, philosophical essays, scientific investigations, political writings, legal documents, critical analyses, historical essays, and such mass media as television, film, newspapers, and magazines. By engaging in the rhetorical analysis of these texts, students examine how the discourses of whiteness continue to frame reality and mediate power relations. A required evening film series accompanying the class has students viewing, discussing, and analyzing feature films, documentary films, and television shows.  Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: .

Within the departments and programs that make up those divisions, Colgate offers 55 majors, including several interdisciplinary choices, all of which have honors programs. Course Designations and Scheduling The courses listed in the catalogue are currently being offered within departments and programs. Some courses are offered annually and others are offered every other year. Students should consult the course offerings posted online prior to each term by the registrar to identify courses that will be offered in the next term. Classes, laboratories, and seminars meet according to the schedule posted on the course offerings for each term. Students are encouraged to discuss their course schedules and major programs with their faculty advisers or with department chairs or program directors. Course Numbering Courses are numbered according to level: the 100-level and 200-level courses are primarily for first-year students and sophomores, the 300-level courses for juniors, and 400-level courses for seniors. A suffix of C indicates a course offered as Core Communities and Identities. A suffix of S indicates a course offered as Core Scientific Perspectives on the World. Language Courses In the foreign and classical languages, courses designated 100 are first-year level, 200 are second-year level, 300 are third-year level, and 400 are advanced level. Students from any class who possess the appropriate background may take any level. Students who have not had third-year level courses at Colgate need faculty permission to take advanced-level courses. Two-term Courses Departments and programs may offer courses, usually at the 400 level, which extend over two terms. These courses may carry two course credits toward graduation, and may have two course numbers, although a single grade will be assigned at the completion of the second course. Students should register for a two-semester course in sequence, ordinarily the fall and spring term of the senior year. Students successfully completing the fall term course will be temporarily assigned a grade of T (for two-term course). The final permanent grade will be assigned at the end of the second term, when all materials have been evaluated, and the grade of T will be changed to the final grade.   2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

In keeping with a cultural studies framework, students examine literature, theatre, music, dance, and film as expressions of Jamaican subjectivities and identities. The contexts and conversations out of which these artistic representations have emerged are considered through historical, sociological, and political texts that help to map the larger cultural matrix. Textual explorations are accompanied by field trips and guest lectures (from experts in the various disciplines) with the understanding that Jamaican culture is not fixed but evolving and dynamic, multifarious, and heterogeneous.

This course is concerned with understanding how to do field research in post-genocide Rwanda. Using the 'do no harm' framework of doing research with individuals who have lived through mass violence, this course equips students to undertake research in foreign field settings. In particular, students learn to design a 'human subjects' research proposal, rooted in The Belmont Report of ethical research and guidelines for research involving human subjects. The Report identified three core principles: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Using Rwanda since the 1994 genocide as a case study, these principles will be studied to highlight their shortcomings in the context of research in post-conflict societies.

Other European nationalities tried white indentured labor before also turning to enslaved African labor.

ANTH 226," - Critical Global Health In contemporary American society, Western medicine-or biomedicine-is seen as offering quick, effective, and technologically advanced solutions to pain and suffering. Biomedicine is a medical system that privileges the physiological and biological causes of disease. As a clinical science, biomedicine is usually seen as culture-less, as universally effective on all bodies. But what happens when Western medicine goes "global," that is, when it encounters cultural values or beliefs that conceptualize illness, healing, or the body in different ways? Is medicine itself "cultural," and if so, how? This course examines how people experience, use, and critique global health interventions across the globe, and why sociological and anthropological approaches to global health are critical to improving these interventions.

The term "techno-science" refers to the fusion of science and technology under modern global capitalism. Using the tools of anthropology, this course explores how techno-science is embedded in social-cultural, political and economic systems and processes. Case studies drawn from the Global North and South show how the context in which techno-science is produced and consumed matters. They reveal how critical examination of different sciences and scientists teaches us as much about the social world as it does about the natural one, and challenge the divide between the two. They also demonstrate how techno-science is a transnational phenomenon, in which ideas, objects, methods and practices change as they travel.

ANTH 322," - Medical Anthropology Introduces students to medical anthropology—the study of the relationships among cultures, social systems, the environment, and disease and healing. Interpretations of health and illness, and the experience of one's body are often taken for granted. Yet our ideas about and experiences of health, disease, and medicine are profoundly shaped by culture; by transnational flow of people, ideas, and resources; by histories of colonialism and structural inequalities; and by the development of new technologies. This course introduces students to approaches used by medical anthropologists to study the social, cultural, economic, and political dimensions of the human experience of the body, health, illness, and healing. Topics covered include cultural interpretations of sickness and healing, cultural ideas about the body, social and environmental causes of illness, the effects of poverty on health, the roles of doctors and healers in society, cultural clashes and ethical issues in health care delivery, anthropological critiques of Western biomedicine, and the place of medical anthropology in the study of public health.

ANTH 375," - Captured by the Lens: Photography in Anthropology and Archaeology Examines the role that photography has played in the emergence of anthropology and archaeology as disciplines. Beginning in the 1860s, advances in technology turned the camera into a standard piece of fieldwork equipment, and a range of image genres emerged as cameras were taken on-site and into the field. Part of the course is historical and archival in intention, and examines the emergence of these image genres, asking questions about the nature of the gaze, about forms of representation, and about the relationship between the visual imagination and more empirically imagined knowledge projects. Another part of the course examines contemporary photographic practices and the leaking of anthropological image genres like the ethnographic photograph into popular forms. Students take a case-study approach and look at individual sites, photographers, and bodies of work, alongside a close reading of contemporary theory. Students are encouraged to take their own photographs, and the course concludes with an exhibition of student work.

ANTH 378," - Social Theory of Everyday Life Since classical times, philosophers and historians have studied and recorded the details of everyday life with an eye to grasping the meaning of social practice. The past 50 years, however, have seen the bourgeoning of an exciting body of critical theory on the quotidian. Much of this work is concerned with profound questions about how the systems, structures, and practices of modernity shape basic human interactions with things, with places, and with other persons, and how these, in turn, reproduce social structures. This course presents sociological and anthropological texts concerned with everyday domesticity, cuisine, gesture, movement, activity, entertainment, talk, schooling, and bureaucracy, and explores the theoretical paradigms of knowledge, practice, and power to which these texts are ultimately addressed.

As students analyze the literary works of people writing within these social and cultural contexts and shifting political views, they are forced to question the nature of oppression. Who does the oppressing? Who are the oppressed? What is the nature of such a relationship? What are the structures of oppression? How does the voice of the oppressed find expression in the language and literary constructs of the dominant culture? What narrative techniques and strategies are employed by oppressors and oppressed in the quest for self-representation? This course allows students to explore the themes of power, self-representation, and language, while developing some important critical reading and analytical writing skills.

Even in the modern world of sophisticated synthetic chemistry, 25 percent of all prescriptions contain plant extracts or active principles prepared from plants. More than providing pain relief and disease cures, the search of effective medical botany has shaped cultures, created fierce wars, and contributed to the modern issues of bio-prospecting, drug wars, and crime scene investigation. This course delves into issues of medical and forensic botany from multiple perspectives. Students develop a greater understanding of basic plant biology and phytochemistry, and learn how many cultures have utilized plants for curative and destructive means. Students also examine how plant-derived drugs have disrupted both ancient and modern cultures, and have shaped the scientific method and modern drug creation. Finally, the class examines how plants play significant roles in early and modern forensics by focusing on major cases whose decisions have hinged on plant evidence.  Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: .

As "Much Ado about Nothing" the course takes its cue from Shakespeare's play of that name (which his first audience would have heard as "much ado about noting") and examines other works in prose and poetry (sonnets, short stories, and novels) that reward a reader's attention to detail in particularly interesting ways.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

ENGL 213," - Imagining Apocalypse An introduction to literary study that explores the tradition of apocalyptic imagination and its relationship to practices of reading and interpretation. Why has the idea of apocalypse been so pervasive in Western literature and civilization? How has apocalypse been variously conceived as the destruction or uncovering of meaning (and sometimes as both at once)? Is apocalypse a full stop, or a transfiguration? Is reading by nature an apocalyptic pursuit? Students consider apocalyptic texts as anticipations of millennial promise, as works of political protest, and as dire prophecies of impending ecological catastrophe. Students also think about the particular character of apocalyptic imagination in contemporary American culture. Writers to be studied include William Blake, William Wordsworth, Lord Byron, Mary Shelley, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Sigmund Freud, Samuel Beckett, Jorie Graham, and Margaret Atwood.

ENGL 214," - Inside/Out: The Literature of Interiority and the Interiority of Literature An introduction to literary study focusing on interiors — psychological, architectural, and literary. Aligning 19th-century developments in domestic architecture with changing ideas of personal subjectivity, we will ask, in turn, how such models structure our understanding of the literary text — as that which has been written and is to be read in private, as that which speaks to our most intimate experience, as that whose formal complexity doubles the domestic interior as a world apart from work and public politics.

ENGL 220," - The Booker Prize: Examining a Prize, Examining an Empire The Booker Prize is awarded annually to a new novel published in the UK by an author from the UK or a former territory of the British Empire. This class will follow the 2017 Booker Prize proceedings and the class schedule will be built live alongside developments in the 2017 prize season over the course of the fall semester. Students will dissect the evolving aesthetics and politics of the prize. Why is the Booker a cultural phenomenon in England and what does it mean to consider the former "Empire" through these largely post-colonial texts? What roles do the judges, the sponsors, and the British and international reading public have? Readings: selected books from the 2017 long/short list, Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children, Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie, Paul Beatty's The Sellout.

ENGL 329," - Inventing Ireland: National Identity - Literary Form in the Irish Republic (Extended Study) A study of Irish writers since the late nineteenth century. Eager to shake off colonial influences, Irish writers have sought to define a distinctly Irish literary tradition. This project characteristically worked by turning to history older than anything English, either to the forgotten writings of Irish antiquity or to elements from Classical antiquity. What these writers made is nothing less than our modern sense of Ireland; and Ireland itself figures as perhaps their most important literary creation of all--an all-encompassing palimpsest of history kept present in the very landscape and its monuments.

Students critically examine the different representations of South Asia from the colonial period to the present moment. The course begins by examining classical texts that were revived during British colonialism, moves to exploring colonial representations of countries in the region, and concludes by discussing contemporary postcolonial texts. The gendered nature of colonial, postcolonial, and global processes is an important part of this course.

ENGL 339," - Modernist Poetry A study of selected British and American poets active between 1900 and 1950. Amidst all the discourse about the "postmodern," it becomes increasingly clear that there is no consensus on what it is "post." More recent versions of the "postmodern" argue that it is not a period but a mode - one coeval with Modernism itself. Modernity and postmodernity can thus be understood only in relation to one another. This course pursues that relation by focusing on poets like W.H. Auden, Sterling Brown, T.S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Mina Loy, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Muriel Rukeyser, Wallace Stevens, Melvin Tolson, or William Carlos Williams.

To uncover the racial and political meanings of twentieth-century mobilities in the Americas, we will explore texts in a variety of media - narrative fiction, poetry, literary nonfiction, photography, sound recordings, and film - and theorize these mediums from a range of perspectives.

ENGL 422," - Confession and Rebellion: American Literature in the 1950s An investigation of the innovative forces of post-World War II American literature. The course will review the tumultuous decade of the 1950s during which time the United States was catapulted into a Cold War with the Soviet Union and a congruent episode of anticommunist hysteria known as McCarthyism. This initiated the new nuclear age created with the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. It was also a decade defined by the struggle with Jim Crow racism and the emergence of a new Civil Rights movement, the birth of the second wave of feminism, and the emergence of a rich range of cultural criticism focused on issues including the social construction of the American family, corporate and suburban conformism, sexual repression, and the destructive capacities of the new military industrial complex. Out of this charged political and cultural situation, writers created some of the most innovative literary works in modern American history.

ENGL 431," - Ethnographic Fictions: Travel Writing, Bearing Witness, and Human Rights Helps students navigate fiction's complex relationship with representation and reality. Scans a broad spectrum of texts, beginning with 18th- and 19th-century European novels, and continue onto contemporary writings from the postcolonial world. Students discuss the complex ways in which fiction documents the social world, produces historical archives, bears witness to trauma and violence, and memorializes loss, but also rejects and/or makes readers critically aware of realism's positivist impulses. Also guides students in reading theoretical texts on the topic. Possible authors include Daniel Defoe, Rudyard Kipling, Leonard Woolf, Bertolt Brecht, Chinua Achebe, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Michael Ondaatje, and David Henry Hwang.

The new genre of fiction became both more popular and more respected; new importance was attached to literary criticism and the essay; and literary biography emerged as a significant genre. Texts include the writings of the poet, literary critic, lexicographer, and biographer Samuel Johnson; those of his biographer James Boswell, who was also one of the most important autobiographers in history; the first epistolary novel, Evelina, by Johnson's protegée Frances Burney; and Tristram Shandy, the first "anti-novel," by their contemporary Laurence Sterne.

ENGL 444," - Modern Wisdom Literature Developing from the "wisdom literatures" of both Greco-Roman and Hebrew tradition, the modern aphorism is characterized by its brief and often pointed expression of an observation or precept. It differs from, say, maxims, proverbs, or apothegms in that it turns on paradox and antithesis; it differs from earlier forms in the ways it undermines rather than supports certainty. This seminar explores the relations of literary form to convictions about the nature and limits of human knowledge, habits of reading, and its uses in life. The course follows the transformation of the aphorism both as form and as impulse as it is reinvented in the Modern period-chiefly following the example of Friedrich Nietzsche-and explores its character as a lyrical corrective to overly definitive and linear ways of organizing and writing about experience.

FMST 212," - Global Media: Flows & Counterflows Regulating and being regulated by a variety of information flows on a daily basis from SMS texts, snapchats, and tweets, to live news feeds, corporate data transfers, and government communiques. We increasingly experience our private and public lives as a hypermediated encounter with the world at large. What impact do these media flows have on our experiences of the local and the global? Simultaneously, how should we understand contemporary mass media themselves as "global"? Have transformations in print, broadcast, and digital media fundamentally altered how we think of the near and the far, the familiar and the foreign, the national and the transnational, the West and the non-West? This course will address these questions through the two structuring notions of the "flow" and the "counter-flow," and analyze the role that media play as both a unifying and a divisive agent, consolidating identities and nationalisms in some instances, and de-territorializing the same in others.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

FMST 320," - European Film History and Theory An introduction to the methods, concepts, movements, and reception of European cinema from 1945 to the present. Selectively surveying the history and theory of Western, Central, and Eastern European filmmaking, students juxtapose the close study of narrative and film form with theoretical texts. From neorealism to the transnational in film, from the postcolonial to double occupancies, lessons emphasize the historic hybridity of commercial and experimental film in Europe and complicate auteurist approaches to European film culture. The postwar thematic motifs which continually surface in European film's changing social and aesthetic landscape (marginality, desire, and the metropolis) is a focal point of discussion and reflection.

FMST 324," - Cinema, Sensation, & Body To what extent does watching a movie imitate the body's own sensorial encounters with the world? How do filmmakers use color, sound, lighting, movement, editing and space to create embodied experience? This course is an introduction to these and related questions by examining both cinema's bodily representations, and the relationship between the viewer's body and the events on the screen. The approach is organized around weekly film screenings that include silent film, art cinema, experimental cinema, classical Hollywood melodrama, and the horror film. Readings explore phenomenological theories of the body by Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Vivian Sobchack, Jennifer Baker, Elena del Rio, Laura Marks, Martine Beugnet, and Steven Shaviro. Students explore related approaches such as affect theory, feminism, and the relationship of bodily representation to painting, especially in the depiction of masochism.

GERM 325," - Transnationalism in Contemporary German Culture Demographic changes in Europe's largest country have transformed conceptions of its national culture. The discourse of transnationalism has emerged to address contemporary political and cultural phenomena no longer confined to the stages of nation-states. This course examines the transnational imagination at work in recent German cultural production, with an emphasis on cinematic negotiations of German and European identity. Factors contributing to these negotiations include the tenuous legacy of German unification, the consolidation of the European Union, and the migration of people to Germany, especially those with a non-European background. The course's method of inquiry is multidisciplinary: a focus on contemporary films is supplemented with historical background, contemporary philosophy, and political essays. To address the aesthetic qualities of transnational cinema, students familiarize themselves with the terminology and methodologies of film studies and perform critical visual analyses of the cinematic material.

GERM 330," - Kafka Kafka may be the most dizzyingly overdetermined proper name in world literature. Not only does it stand for the author, it has come to signify a host of political, institutional, existential, and aesthetic conditions. One refers to "Kafkaesque" experiences, sensibilities, or bureaucracies; situations, movies, the 20th century, and modern life are all regularly dubbed "Kafkan" or "Kafkaish." The name seems to have a life of its own; but to understand what it means, students must animate Kafka by reading him. Students read, discuss, and think about a range of Kafka's writing, from novels and short stories to diary entries and legal brief, paying close attention not only to the texts and their various obsessions, but to their emergence in his creative process and their afterlives in translation and the works of other artists. Students explore the multicultural Central European milieu that Kafka inhabited and examine the global transmission and remediation of his work in its critical reception, multiple translations, and adaptations; its transmutation into a style; and its metastasis in popular culture. Taught in English. Participation in the accompanying FLAC section is mandatory for students wishing to earn GERM major/minor credit for this course.

GERM 465," - Genius and Madness Since Plato, artists and philosophers have recognized the close connection between genius and madness (Wahnsinn). But how exactly does one distinguish between inspiration and mania? Why is it so many geniuses are also mad? And how do changing definitions of mental illness affect how one perceives the relationship between madness and genius across history? These questions are central to the study of literature, philosophy, and the history of social institutions. In this course, students delve deeper into these questions by examining a series of literary, philosophical, and visual works from the German tradition that foreground the relationship between madness and genius, as well as works by geniuses that may also have been "mad." Authors may include Plato, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Hölderlin, Immanuel Kant, Heinrich von Kleist, Georg Büchner, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Friedrich Nietzsche, Robert Walser, and Thomas Mann.

Do Senoçak's readers in America contribute to a new idea of German or German-Turkish literature? Topics include the roles of translation, migration, economic and media globalization, nationalisms, and contemporary and historical transnational identities in shaping world literature written originally in German.

HIST 380," - Emancipation, Forced Labor, and Contemporary Bondage in Africa (AF) Examines the transition from slavery to freedom, forced labor during colonial rule, and contemporary forms of slavery in Africa. One of the moral justifications for the European conquest of Africa was the ending of slavery and slave trade.

Finding it difficult to organize labor, the colonial authorities used forced labor with no or little compensation and, since independence modern forms of slavery are still practiced in many parts of the continent. Major themes include: abolition laws and emancipation in practice; colonial rule and the slow attack on slavery; plantation labor in East Africa; slavery as an international issue; forced labor, contemporary human trafficking and migrations.

CORE 159C," - Maya The term "Maya" typically conjures images of ancient pyramids and/or ancient civilizations that are now found in ruins. Some forms of popular media, particularly science fiction, even go as far as describing the Maya people as a civilization that mysteriously disappeared sometime around AD. 900. The Maya currently total over 7 million people in what is today Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, and El Salvador. Furthermore, the word "Maya" serves as an umbrella term that refers to a number of diverse populations, each with distinct culture, language, and material culture. This course will focus on both the construction of the pan-Maya identity, and the numerous populations included within the concept, such as the Tzel Tal, Tzotzil, Kaqchikel, K'iche', Chantal, and the Lacandon, just to name a few. Each of these groups has distinct histories, which often demonstrated significant clashes with colonial and modem national hegemonies. This course also highlights how tradition, language, and identity are preserved under the forces of colonial and nationalistic domination and will also delve into the subject of changing traditions, as these Maya movements of resistance have integrated social media, rock music, and hip-hop to engage younger generations. Ultimately, the Maya provide a means of deconstructing the concept of identity itself by demonstrating how shared identities are constructed, contested, and negotiated.

This watershed event is historically situated and culturally contextualized as a way to study Rwanda's past and the questions it raises about its future. The experience of Rwandans and consideration of how they understand themselves are analyzed. Assesses the historical and social implications of being ethnic Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa in Rwanda, whether at particular watershed moments — in for example 1894, 1931, 1959, or 1994 — or during periods of so-called 'normalcy' that the country has enjoyed in the past and is experiencing at the moment. 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

These cultures are studied in terms of their historical and political relationship to Anglo-American society and institutions, attending to Native Americans' resistance to attempted conquest by European or American powers, the creation of reservation systems, and the use of institutions (e.g., the Bureau of Indian Affairs, schools, missions) to change Native American cultures. Students also examine the response of Native Americans to outside pressures. Students explore other issues, such as sovereignty, identity, gambling, repatriation, land claims, and education, and their impact on North American Indians.

CORE 180C," - French Caribbean Martinique, a 400 square-mile island, is an official part of France today despite being 4200 miles away from mainland France. French is the official language but most Martinicans freely express themselves in Creole. The majority of Martinicans will declare that they are, first and foremost, citizens of the French Republic, but will also readily admit that they are Martinican by culture. What is striking about Martinique is the dizzying array of cultural signifiers that seem to coexist in a veritable braided community, in which it can be genuinely difficult to tell where one cultural identity strand ends and another begins. Martinique is thus a fabulous lens through which this process of negotiating and renegotiating of cultures, languages, and identities can be viewed, and can be considered a precursor to modern-day globalization.

This is largely a recent phenomenon brought about unwittingly by the ethnocentric policies imposed throughout the Tibetan Plateau by the modern Chinese state. However, earlier processes were already under way before the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet in the 1950s, which made the transition from a constellation of feudal polities to a nation possible. These included a common written language, common subsistence patterns (farming, pastoralism, and trade), Buddhism, participation in common rituals and festival (especially religious pilgrimage), a certain respect for the authority of the Dalai Lamas, and so on. Students examine these processes as well as the consequences of China's political and economic incorporation of Tibetan areas into its nascent nation-state. Specific topics to be explored include "the Tibet Problem" (i.e. contemporary Sino-Tibetan relations and conflict), the historic colonial and religious ties between China Proper and Tibet, religious life and everyday Tibetans, "nomadism" (or pastoralism), polyandry and women in Tibet, and Tibetans' encounter with modernity and the West.

CORE 400," - Core Distinction Seminar The goal of the distinction seminar is to complement honors work in departments and programs by giving select students the opportunity to reflect on the broader, interdisciplinary contexts of their honors projects. Through readings assigned by the seminar instructors, students explore the methodologies of their own and other disciplines. Each student writes a substantial interdisciplinary paper relevant to the student's departmental honors work. This requirement may be satisfied in one of the following ways: 1) by extending a departmental honors project to explore interdisciplinary perspectives on the project topic or to examine the social implications or historical foundations of the project; 2) by self-consciously considering the generation and evaluation of knowledge in the major; or 3) by collaborating with one or more members of the seminar to explore themes common to the students' departmental projects. To enroll in the distinction seminar, students must achieve a 3.33 (B+) or better GPA in the five Core components: Legacies of the Ancient World, Challenges of Modernity, Scientific Perspectives on the World, Communities and Identities, and Global Engagements. For students who repeat or complete multiple courses with a Common Core component, only the grade in the first course is considered. A cumulative grade for all Global Engagements courses completed is averaged in the Core GPA. To earn Distinction in the Liberal Arts Core, students must earn an A- or better in the distinction seminar, earn departmental honors with the completion of the department honors project, and achieve an overall GPA of 3.33 or better at the time of graduation.

CORE 100S," - Sports and the Scientific Method In today's world of sports, how is knowledge obtained? On what principles are strategy determined, personnel decisions made, and honors awarded? The advent of computers and the availability of large statistical databases have moved the source of knowledge away from conventional wisdom to more scientific and testable ideas. Questions of strategy and team decisions can now be addressed in an empirical fashion, causing a major impact in sports. Behind this revolution lies the scientific method of inquiry, including the notion of falsifiability and the relationship between theory and observation. This course explores these ideas using examples in sports to illustrate more general scientific concepts. Students explore the impact of empirical knowledge on the games themselves, and how it has caused changes in strategies and team decisions. Finally, the students ask their own sports questions and answer them in a scientific fashion.

CORE 103S," - Remote Sensing of the Environment Remote sensing is the art and science of obtaining information about a phenomenon through a device that is not in contact with the object. The remote sensing process involves collection and analysis of data about energy, reflected from or emitted by an object. Remote sensing is used to better understand, measure, and monitor features and human activities on Earth. After an introduction to the interplay among science, technology, and remote sensing, students examine the development of remote sensing technology. Students focus on the physical principles upon which remote sensing is based, explore the basic tools of photography and photograph interpretation, and consider the principles of acquiring and interpreting data collected by non-photographic sensors. Throughout the semester, students consider how remote sensing has improved our understanding of biophysical processes using a case-study approach to demonstrate the theoretical underpinnings. Finally, consideration is given to the ethical implications of remote sensing.

CORE 104S," - Fundamental Quests in Science: From Subatomic to Cosmological Where are we? What are we made of? How do we know? These are fundamental questions in science. This course explores these questions via several topics of much research in science today. It looks at fundamental questions at the cosmological scale, like the big bang, the structure of the universe, birth and death of stars, and the nature of black holes; and then inward to fundamental questions in the subatomic world, made up of baryons, mesons, leptons, and quarks. The exercise shows that the properties of elementary particles and their interactions are intimately tied to the cosmological questions. The discussion centers on what we know about these topics and how we investigate them. An important component of this course is the discussion of the outstanding puzzles today, like dark matter in the universe, the missing energy fueling its expansion, and whether certain fundamental particles exist or not. In exploring these questions the course provides an introductory coverage of the major physical theories: Newtonian mechanics, quantum mechanics, and relativity. How do these questions affect society and humanity? The course also examines some of the current controversies and debates.

Imagine enjoying abundance with no manufacturing costs and taking an elevator to the moon. Imagine also the loss of all personal privacy and the irreversible poisoning of the environment. Such are the hopes, hype, and fears of nanotechnology — the study of materials and devices with dimensions on the nanoscale (1 x 10-9m, the realm of assemblies of molecules). This course provides an introduction to the science and potential implications of molecular nanotechnology. Scientific and sensationalist visions of nanotechnology are critically examined through a combination of readings, lectures, discussions, and presentations. The course forges an appreciation for the nanoscale, an understanding of the excitement and the challenges, and an awareness of the societal and ethical implications. Through the lens of nanotechnology, students gain insights applicable to the broad landscape of emerging technologies — and encourage curiosity towards the future.

CORE 106S," - Saving the Appearances: Galileo, the Church, and the Scientific Endeavor Four hundred years ago, Galileo Galilei turned his modest telescope skyward. The universe he discovered was a stark contrast to the universe described by the ancient Greek philosophers whose cosmology had held sway for over a millennium. Some 60 years after the publication of Copernicus' treatise "On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres," Galileo used his newfound insight into the nature of the heavens to support the heliocentric model of the universe. In so doing, Galileo challenged not only the authority of Aristotelian cosmology, but also the religious tradition and interpretation of the scripture by the Holy Fathers of the Catholic Church. This episode in the history of western science and the development of the Church is often cited as one of the original clashes between modern science and religious traditions. The discoveries, writings, and trial of Galileo Galilei will serve as both a focus and backdrop for students to explore the practical development of scientific thought and the near simultaneous invention and re-invention of the Church. In addition to readings, written responses, and classroom discussions, the course requires students to repeat many of the ground-breaking observations Galileo made using a hand-held refracting telescope similar in size and shape to the one he built.

Begins with perhaps the oldest biological question of all: why are there so many living things? Shows how Charles Darwin's brilliant answer forms the foundation for much of modern biology. By following the path of discovery leading from Darwin, students learn about a devout monk named Gregor Mendel, a feisty chemist named Louis Pasteur, and two brash young scientists named Watson and Crick. Explores the great diversity of life and how organisms adapt and change. The approach is student-active and hands-on; students work together to unravel a few of the mysteries of life.

CORE 113S," - How to Build a Baby If one were a highly developed, extraterrestrial scientist with advanced technology to engineer organisms from other planets, how would one build a human baby? What kind of brain would one design? What kinds of social, emotional, and cognitive predispositions would be included? What kind of environment would one provide? To answer these questions, one must determine what is innate and what is learned in human development. Although this "nature-nurture" question can be traced back to ancient philosophers (right here on Earth!), modern-day science has made great strides in exploring (and reformulating) this question. In this class, students first explore some pop-culture approaches to this issue. Then, they briefly trace the history of the debate to its foundations in classical and modern philosophy. Finally, students compare these philosophical and pop-culture perspectives to modern-day scientific approaches. This is accomplished through primary and secondary readings, class discussions, and group presentations. In the end, students may discover that the answers to the "nature-nurture" question are not on a planet far, far way - but rather closer to home than they have ever been.

Students examine what astronomy and physics tell about the origin and evolution of the Universe, the production of elements that make up living matter on Earth, the evolution of stars like the Sun, and the formation of solar systems. Also examined are the astronomical, geological, chemical, and biological conditions that were responsible for the origin and evolution of life on Earth, and speculate about the possibility of life on other planets in our solar system or on planets around other stars. How would one detect the presence of life on other planets in the solar system; in the galaxy? The development of intelligent life and the possibility of contact between civilizations are examined.

CORE 124S," - Cells and Human Development The fusion of sperm and egg cells to form a single-celled zygote is the initial step in development in most multi-cellular organisms. In humans, repeated divisions of this single fertilized egg are responsible for the production of more than 70 trillion cells of greater than 200 different types. In this course students examine how a fertilized egg undergoes division, how the stem cells produced by these divisions become "determined" to form cells of particular types, and how these determined cells finally differentiate into the highly specialized cells that make up most tissues and organs. As this process is examined, students also explore the relationship between cells and developmental patterns, and investigate how genetic and environmental factors can influence (and alter) cell fate. Biological, social, and ethical aspects of the human manipulation of development are also considered, including examination of such topics as cloning by nuclear transfer, reproductive technology, fetal surgery, stem cells, and embryonic gene therapy.

CORE 129S," - Dangerous Earth: Science of Geologic Disasters Geologic disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions, serve as dramatic reminders of the power of nature and the catastrophic impact that these disasters have on society. As recent events such as the 2003 tsunami in Sumatra demonstrate, these disasters can exact a terrible cost in both economic terms and loss of life. Society has a clear interest in understanding what causes these disasters and how to reduce their impact on human populations. Geology provides a scientific framework for understanding the potential risks and effects of geologic disasters. This course examines the science behind four disasters that pose major risks to society: floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and meteoric impacts. Students examine significant case studies to understand the types of data collected to study these disasters, ambiguities in the data, and how risk is estimated. Students also examine potential ways to reduce the damage caused by such hazards and the scientific, economic, political, and societal implications of these approaches.

CORE 137S," - Mind, Body, and Health The relationship between the mind and the body has been a topic of speculation and controversy through human history. This course explores this relationship by examining how psychological and social factors influence human health. Proponents of Western medicine have frequently dismissed a mind-body link as folklore; others, especially writers for the popular media, have claimed that the mind has miraculous power to cure disease. In recent years, scientists have conducted numerous studies aimed at discovering how thoughts and emotions actually influence physical health, and what mechanisms underlie this influence. Students evaluate this literature, learning about the effects of beliefs, emotional states (depression, anxiety), 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

CORE 141S," - From the Atkins Diet to the Kyoto Treaty: Science, the News Media, and You Many of the important issues that confront society, from health-related concerns to environmental protection, are scientific at their core, and society relies almost exclusively on the news media for information about them. However, a lot can happen to scientific data on its way to becoming a headline. Politicians, industries, and other groups have a stake in the perception of scientific issues and can potentially influence the content and presentation of news. This course dissects the forces that control perception of scientific news and provides strategies for obtaining more detailed information. The course comprises a series of self-contained units that each focus on a single issue and may include such disparate topics as the Atkins diet, the Kyoto Protocol, nanotechnology, the human genome project, and space exploration, as well as some of the students' choosing. Each unit begins with a general introduction to the underlying science, moves on to explore social, political, and economic aspects, and culminates with a writing assignment or class-wide participatory event.

CORE 145S," - Mind and Brain in Meditation Dhyana, Ch'an, Zazen, Meditation: These are all words for the ancient practice of mindful sitting. This simple practice has endured for millennia and has thrived in a wide variety of cultures, including, most recently, the West. To the Western mind, this practice of "doing nothing" is full of paradox. In this course students explore the practice, both academically and experientially. They study the effects of meditation on the structure and function of the brain, and on psychological measures of concentration, cognition, consciousness, and well-being. The course seeks explanations from research on mind, brain, and behavior, for how "doing nothing" can have such profound effects. Students sit regularly in meditation and use themselves as subjects of their own research on the effects of meditation. This course should give students a better understanding of psychology, scientific research, and meditation, and no previous experience with any of these is necessary to fully participate in the course.

CORE 146S," - The Good Life: Perspectives from Psychological Science Throughout history, men and women have been captivated by questions of what constitutes the "good life" and how such a life can be cultivated. What is the nature of human happiness, joy, and pleasure? How can people most effectively cope with the inevitable difficulties faced in life? Are some people simply born more content than others? How are happiness and life satisfaction affected by health, relationships, material wealth, culture, habits of thought, and spiritual practice? This course focuses on how contemporary psychological research can be used to answer these enduring questions. Students read original research articles on these topics and gain hands-on experience collecting and analyzing data. Throughout the course, students are helped to recognize the strengths and limitations of the scientific method for approaching questions such as these, and students are encouraged to articulate their own emerging views of what constitutes a life worth living.

CORE 153S," - Acid Rain: A Persistent Environmental Problem Acid rain surfaced as an environmental problem in the 1960's and a multitude of studies were conducted in the Northeastern US, Canada and much of the United Kingdom and Europe that examined the sources and scope of the problem as well as the impacts on terrestrial and aquatic environments. The Adirondack Mountains are particularly sensitive to acid deposition because of their geology and topography. Many different collaborative studies were conducted with geologists, biologists, hydrologists and atmospheric scientists, and their results led legislators to enact the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. Twenty five years later, we examine how scientists addressed skeptical concerns about the extent of the acid rain problem, how effective the legislation has been in recovery of lakes, streams and forests as well as efforts to mitigate the effects of acid deposition through lime applications that neutralize acid and restore chemistry to lakes, streams and forests. Students will gain an understanding of linkages between soils, forests, streams and lakes, and we will compare how scientists and legislators addressed the acid rain problem versus our current actions to address climate change. Students compare restoration "success" in the Adirondack Mountains to changes in precipitation chemistry and biota in other parts of the world such as Canada, different European countries, the United Kingdom and Asia.

CORE 163S," - This Old Earth: Scientific and Cultural Perspectives on the Discovery of Deep Time The antiquity of the Earth is geology's most important contribution to science. In the late 18th and 19th centuries new findings about the Earth's history and fossil record came into conflict with religious and cultural understandings of creation, evolution, and the place of man in the universe. These issues have been debated since Darwin first articulated his theory of evolution by natural selection. More recently, controversy over anthropogenic climate change has provoked similar questions: How long has our present climate lasted, and what has been the scale of climate change in the past? Knowledge of the Earth's vast age has reached past scientific debates and influenced all aspects of life, including religion, poetry, art, and architecture. In this course, students explore the changing cultural and scientific views of the age of the Earth and how these longstanding debates influence how science is seen by non-scientists.

This course will explore what the science of social psychology tells us about how social inequality shapes the ways we think, live, and die. Because social inequality is about the relative status of people based on their group memberships, we will begin the course by exploring social psychological theories that help explain the centrality of our group memberships to our identity. As we will see, these group memberships can be based on many different aspects of our identity: race, gender, socioeconomic status, among many others. Next, we will explore what experimental data tell us about the sources of, and consequences of, group-based disparities. In particular, we will examine the roles of limited resources, identity, power, morality, and prejudice in perpetuating inequality. Finally, we will discuss the emerging literature on how to coexist more peacefully in an unequal world.

CORE 184S," - Fire Fire is the quintessential human technology. It is also a potent symbol whose meaning has become central to our national and community discourse. Fire is at the root of countless traditions, myths, and foodways, and through controlled combustion of fossil fuels, fire has grown to be the central process at the heart of modern industrial and agricultural systems. The deliberate release of energy through different forms of combustion has changed the course of human social- and potentially, biological evolution. But where does the energy in combustion come from? How do humans harness that energy to do work? And how do storytelling and cultural perceptions of fire influence the choices individuals and societies make about what resources to burn, where to burn them, and what to do with the waste products?

MATH 149," - Mathematical Deliberation The emphasis throughout this course is the development of the ability to think creatively - to solve mathematical exercises that must be stated as a mathematical model (the creative thinking aspect) and then solved using techniques encountered during a student's secondary educational experience in mathematics in the courses known as algebra, plane geometry, trigonometry and elementary functions. An inspiration for this offering reflects the ability of computers and calculators to carry out many of the mathematical techniques needed to obtain a solution to a mathematical model - it is the modeling aspect that is now the stumbling block to solving mathematically posed problems and it has always been the more difficult aspect to address when solutions to problems (especially "word" problems) are requested.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

MATH 389," - Axiomatic Set Theory Set theory serves as a foundation for all of mathematics, in the sense that all of the objects and constructions of mathematics can be expressed in terms of sets. It was discovered over 100 years ago, however, that intuitive set theory is riddled with contradictions. This course introduces students to the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, which restrict the ways in which sets can be formed, in the hope of avoiding the contradictions. Topics include the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms and some of their consequences; well-orderings and various statements equivalent to the axiom of choice; and ordinal and cardinal numbers.

MIST 210," - An Introduction to Arabic Literature in Translation This survey of Arabic literature in translation is designed to introduce students to the wealth and richness of literary history and art of expression of the Arabs. Modern Arabic literature embodies the emotion, aspiration, and universal humanism of the millions of Arabic-speaking people. This literary production is deeply rooted in a tradition of eloquence and manifested in diverse forms in poetry and prose over the past 1900 years. The course traces Arabic literature and its diverse forms in two distinctive approaches. The first is historical, starting with the pre-Islamic period (6th century CE) through the 18th century CE. The second approach is thematic, introducing students to a range of literary genres such as novels, short stories, modern poetry, and drama. A selection of major works in English translation and representative of the various genres provides the foundation for readings and discussions. The list is carefully selected to expose students to different literary genres as well as the diversity of Arabic-speaking populations and geographical regions.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

PCON 240," - Waging Nonviolence: Theory, Practice, and Critique When people think about the social movements behind struggles for revolutionary change or territorial independence, they often imagine armed insurrections, guerrilla armies, and terrorist organizations. Yet nonviolent movements are far more likely to achieve revolution or independence than violent movements. Nonviolent movements are also more likely to install durable and democratic governments after the conflict is over. These nonviolent victories often take place when movements abandon violence and adopt civil resistance as their leading strategy. To understand these global trends, this course investigates the dynamics of violent and nonviolent conflicts using theories of social movements. This theoretical understanding is tested using comparative case study analysis, student research projects, computer game play, and real-world simulations.

Concentrating on the US armed forces, this class explores how mission, thought, culture, and politics shape the military and its functions. Part of our challenge is to understand the relationship among these factors. This course discusses major themes in modern military studies, with a focus on military organization. It explores why militaries change and adapt – or fail to – and asks what exactly they are meant to do in the first place. Students gain literacy in major topics and controversies in military studies and major issues in current military policymaking, as well as learn practical career skills through practice creating executive summaries.

PCON 301," - International Human Rights and Advocacy The gap between the promise of international human rights law and its actual practice is vast. For many advocates and activists, the gap is a source of frustration as international human rights laws and norms rarely translate into basic protections at the level of the individual. This course is designed to make students aware of the contentious nature of human rights, both in theory and in practice.

PCON 314," - Media War: Peace and Conflict in the Digital Age The first purpose of the course is to demonstrate the central importance of media in defining the reality of war, peace, and violence in modern culture. The second goal is to introduce, in a selective manner, film, art, and written works that shaped these definitions. The primary framework is chronological, beginning with a survey of images of war and peace in art, covering in detail World War I and World War II, and ending with current images of war and of preparations for nuclear war. The secondary framework distinguishes types or degrees of war: World War I and World War II, civil wars (Spain) and genocide (the Armenians, the Jews in Europe); struggles of national liberation (Vietnam and Algeria); and prospects of global holocaust, this last creating new imagery - both positive and negative - in art, poetry, fiction, and film.

PCON 322," - Weapons and War: Interdisciplinary Perspectives Mustard gas, airpower, submarines, A-bombs, Agent Orange, landmines, terror wars, "Star Wars": weapons technology profoundly shaped the science, politics, and culture of the last century. This course explores the myriad effects of the production, deployment, and use of weapons. Specifically, the course considers how the horizons of science and technology have been shaped by the quest for ever-more-powerful or -sophisticated weaponry; how the creation of new weapons changes the nature of war and peace; how new weapons may impact lives and the planet; terror as a weapon, and scientific and social responses to it; the role of media images in the public consciousness of weaponry and war; and impacts of the global arms trade. While critically theorizing the social, environmental, and philosophical impacts of war over the past century, the course also examines the place of global ethics in discussions about weapons and war.

PCON 333," - Religious Faith and Social Ethics Social ethics pursues questions about how human societies ought to organize themselves and their relations to other communities in order to realize human values. For many people around the world, religious faith provides the ultimate framework for value decisions. Texts include works by earlier religious leaders of movements for social-political-economic justice (e.g., Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr.) as well as very recent works addressing current issues such as ethnic/international/religious conflict, environmental devastation, globalization, and religious terrorism. In addition, one or two texts develop basic models for religious social ethics.  Credits: 1.00 Crosslisted: "

PCON 340," - Terror and Counter - Terror: Histories and Logics of Asymmetric Warfare For as long as empires and states have been going to war, people have been fighting them with the tactics and technologies now known as terrorism and guerrilla warfare. Asymmetric warfare, however, is no mere historical artifact. It dominates headlines as much as it confounds leaders around the world. Central to this course are several in depth case studies of counter-insurgency and terrorism, including France in Algeria and Indochina; the British in Malaya, East Africa and Northern Ireland; state terrorism in Latin America during the Cold War; and the United States in the Philippines, Vietnam, and, after September 11, 2001, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. The evolution of non-state terrorism — from the violent acts of Anarchists in the late 19th Century to the potentially apocalyptic terrorism of radical religious groups the early 21st Century — also comes under scrutiny. From Clausewitz to General Petraeus, from Mao Zedong to Ayman Al-Zawahiri, this class explores how asymmetric war is lived and understood by various observers and participants.

PCON 341," - War and the Shaping of American Politics Examines the impact of warfare, expansion, and national security policy on the development of domestic American institutions and politics since the Revolution. War's impact has been multifaceted and contradictory, fueling a politics of reaction and repression in many contexts while serving as a catalyst for advances in political, racial, and economic equality and inclusion in others. Students will explore those contradictions by connecting war mobilization and security politics to the trajectory of American political development and state/society relations over time. Topics include: the role of the putatively weak American state in shaping 19th century territorial expansion; the effect of wartime mobilization and participation on racial politics; the interplay of warfare and the welfare state in American history; the postwar politics of the "military-industrial complex;" and the impact of foreign policy and national security on the American party system.

Are the reasons for which we act also the causes of our actions, or are reason-based and cause-based explanations of human behavior fundamentally distinct? Are economists correct in their assumptions about the rationality of economic agents? Is it possible, or desirable, to conduct social scientific research in a value-neutral fashion? If not, what are the consequences for the objectivity of the social sciences? Are our values and moral attitudes themselves merely the effects of natural selection, as evolutionary psychologists maintain?

The motivations for and benefits of these distinctions are explored, with special attention paid to Hume's concerns about religious "enthusiasm." Rigid versions of these distinctions have, however been criticized for their serious costs in both epistemology and ethics. The course engages recent major criticisms, and then considers whether Hume or Smith might have had a more nuanced understanding of the distinctions they worked with than their many followers did.

Reforms are a concern as well. Finally, the class considers the ways people in a variety of cultures judge right and wrong, and how they respond to the wrongdoing they perceive around them.

POSC 314," - American Political Development An introduction the political science subfield of American Political Development, which traces the historical development of political institutions and the evolution of state/society relations in this country. How "exceptional" is the trajectory of state-building in the United States compared with other long-term democracies? What is the role of culture in shaping American politics and explaining change over time? How has race figured historically in the articulation of state power? Course readings tackle these and other questions from the perspective of political scientists, sociologists, and historians working on a broad empirical terrain spanning several centuries.

POSC 315," - Government and the Economy The course examines the inevitable intrusion of politics into economic policy making, with examples drawn from a variety of policy areas including traditional economic regulation, the new social regulation, energy and environmental policies, and recent trends toward deregulation. The course begins with elementary economic theory: the case for free markets, a review of the various ways unregulated markets break down, and rational prescriptions for remedying market failures. The bulk of the course then examines the factors operating to make these market failures more complex than at first they appear, producing policies that depart from economic ideals.

POSC 322," - The Politics of Privatization The adoption of neoliberal economic policies has been one of the most significant reforms undertaken around the world in the last two decades. Privatization, in particular, has been so popular and so widespread that one writer has remarked that even the United States, the quintessential free market economy, was "looking for something to sell." This course examines political and economic explanations for the global adoption of privatization and economic restructuring in the 1980s and 1990s. It looks at the conditions under which governments enacted policies and compares the outcome of privatization measures in selected countries and sectors in East and Central Europe, Latin America, and Africa. It analyzes the claims of critics of privatization and the responses of privatization's winners and losers. Students examine recent changes in the approach to the distribution of public goods and explore innovative public-private partnerships such as that between the development agency, CARE, and the coffee company, Starbucks, to provide water, sanitation, or micro-credit in developing countries.

POSC 323," - American Elections and Party Power Focuses closely on the US party system and the electoral area in which the parties struggle for power. In order to develop a strong conception of American parties, students combine scrutiny of the day-to-day media representations of political parties with important comparative perspectives to understand how American parties and elections fit into broader political science frameworks, as well as their long-term and global implications. Students compare the current US party system in three directions: back through history (especially the 20th century) to understand the roots of today's parties; out to the rest of the world, comparing party systems in other highly democratic countries; and also down to the state level, where students examine to what degree New York State parties and elections reflect national trends. Important topics covered include the effects of redistricting and campaign finance. Students also investigate the importance of issue-framing with units on contrasting party strategies of presenting a "war on women" and President Obama's "socialism."

POSC 338," - Sex, Law, and the American Culture Wars Explores the American church-state debate through the lens of abortion and same-sex marriage. These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's "culture wars" in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S.  Credits: 1.00 Prerequisites: None Major/Minor Restrictions: None Class Restriction: None Area of Inquiry: Social Relations,Inst.& Agents Liberal Arts CORE: None "
POSC 340," - Politics of the American Metropolis The United States is an urban society: today nearly 80 percent of Americans live in urbanized, metropolitan areas. These urban areas are governed by a dizzying array of local, state, and federal institutions whose policies affect citizens' lives enormously and in myriad ways. This course explores the politics of urban America in the context of the contemporary metropolis. The legal and philosophical origins of local American government are discussed, along with the political economy of the city and classic theories of urban politics. The course traces the history of urbanization and the accompanying growth of government institutions, and addresses issues of suburbanization, regional balkanization, and federalism. Other issues addressed in the course include land use, segregation, housing, economic development, and poverty.  Credits: 1.00 Corequisite: None Prerequisites: "

POSC 345," - The News Media and the Political Process Politics is a distant and dimly understood process for most people; still, they must somehow come to terms with the threats and reassurances it offers, and reach assessments of personalities and policies about which they often know little. This course is an analysis of politics and the media from the inside out, beginning with the ways people receive, interpret, or ignore the media messages directed at them. News reporting and questions of bias are treated in the context of a group analysis of important stories. The class also considers the evolution and refinement of media campaigning techniques. Those who cannot purchase time or space in the mass media may resort to protest, terror, and violence in order to air their views.

POSC 346," - Beneath the Black Robes: Courts as Political Institutions Focuses on the causal dynamics of judicial behavior. Introduces students to the study of courts as political institutions and, in doing so, provides some understanding of the political nature of the role of courts in American society. Departs from the view that landmark national decisions such as Roe v. Wade, Baker v. Carr, and Brown v. Bd. of Education, along with their more recent conservative corollaries, are solely the product of adherence to constitutional standards of interpretation. Instead, it posits that these controversial rulings and judicial policy in general can be explained through careful examination of certain political factors. In short, the course is based on the premise that the judiciary is a permeable structure that is responsive to democratic processes and that, in turn, exerts influence upon those processes. Two major theoretical concerns integrate the lectures and materials covered: 1) the dynamic relationship between court decision-making processes and major features of the larger American political arena, and 2) the inherent tensions between judicial independence and democratic politics.

POSC 370," - International Relations in the Post-Cold War Environment The end of the Cold War and the introduction of a large number of non-traditional issues (environmental, economic, and normative) to the international agenda have raised very serious questions about the discipline of international relations itself. How new or old will the new international relations be? What conceptual framework should be used to explore these issues? What issues should be the focus? The course begins with a reassessment of the grand tradition in international relations and of how the order, upon which it was based, fell. The emerging world order and the agenda of new issues with which it confronts us, the likely new patterns of cooperation and conflict those issues will foster, and the possibilities for a new consensus are considered.

Not only does behavior vary dramatically across cultures and over time, but so do conceptions of truth, God, religion, morality, justice, and the good. Differences abound. The intent of this course is to look at the controversies that divide social and political theorists in their effort to understand human beings and the human condition. In the process students discover that beneath conflicting theories are recurring themes concerning subjectivity and objectivity, the nature of human beings, theories of self and other, as well as a debate over rationality, irrationality, truth, and knowledge. By better understanding these controversies students gain new insights into human nature, human knowledge, and the human condition.

POSC 389," - Constitutional Law: Structures and Powers The focus of this course is what Aristotle identified as the central question of political science, the character of regime--the organization of offices and the distribution of power that is designed to achieve an understanding of justice and the human good. More specifically, students focus on the structural characteristics of the American regime, or Constitution--separation of powers, federalism, emergency powers, property rights; but students are equally concerned with the politics of interpretation itself--the complex process by which people determine what is the Constitution, how it is to be understood, and who has authority to interpret it. The responsibility for constitutional interpretation is broadly distributed, but it is also obvious that the preeminent voice for interpreting the Constitution has become the Supreme Court. Accordingly, students spend the greater portion of the course with the analysis of cases, that is, the Court's opinion of what the Constitution means.

Most have had relatively free and honest elections; some have even had peaceful transfers of power later on; most are somewhere in the process of changing to market economies. But in many places, the quality of life has deteriorated in important respects, and democratization is stale-mated by economic crises, ethnic and religious conflicts, low levels of political participation, crime, and other problems. This seminar explores democratic transitions - the removal of repressive regimes and the establishment of new democratic institutions - and democratic consolidation - the process of "deepening" democracy and making it sustainable.

POSC 418," - Seminar: Urbanism and Civil Society: Decline and ...? In this seminar, students consider both the life cycles of American industrial cities and the rise and fall of "urbanism"--informal, interpersonal processes of leadership, problem solving, and street-level self-government that took root as such cities developed and then eroded as they declined. Urbanism is one important variety of "social capital" and "civil society," and helps students understand such concepts in detail. With strong urbanism in place, an unambitious local government can succeed; without it, even the best ideas backed by generous funding are likely to fail. The class focuses on the city of New Haven, Connecticut, and close reading of several classic texts. Students use the "Sim City 4" urban simulator to explore the processes outlined in the readings, and build and analyze simulated cities of their own. More recent readings on urban trends and styles of development round out the class's consideration of the ways in which cities once governed themselves and of the problems they face in the future.

POSC 420," - Seminar: Street-Level Bureaucracy We live in an age of bureaucratic organization. Bureaucracies defend us, educate us, collect our taxes, provide us with basic services, protect our health and safety, and occasionally kill us. Effective bureaucratic agencies are necessary for the creation and sustenance of modern, democratic government. At the same time, bureaucratic power can be a threat to democracy. Legislatures may pass laws, executives may issue orders, and courts may judge, but real governance happens when a soldier fires a gun, a teacher grades a paper, an inspector certifies an aircraft, and a police officer writes a speeding ticket. The difference between effective and dysfunctional bureaucracy at the street level--where governments and people interact--can make the difference between flourishing and failing democracy. This seminar offers an introduction to organizational theory and the politics of bureaucracy, with discussions and analysis centered on the HBO series "The Wire." Students learn classic theories and emerging research on human organization and bureaucratic politics by applying them to the characters and stories of the acclaimed television series.

The seminar's reading will, therefore, emphasize the Journals of the Continental Congress and the Records of the Federal Convention of 1787.

What are the distinct forms of constitutional government and what are their advantages and disadvantages? To what extent should we consider a constitution a cause or effect of political culture? How should one interpret a constitution; to what extent are the terms of American debate—such as originalism v. nonoriginalism—found in other countries? As the form of government to which most countries aspire today (or the form they claim to be), liberal democracy seems to have pride of place, but why? Is it the right answer to the ancient question of the "best regime"? Or perhaps the best practicable regime?

PSYC 366," - Psychology of Leadership An exploration of the psychological forces that give root to human dominance, hierarchy, and leadership. Guided by evolutionary, developmental, and cross-cultural perspectives, questions about social power and leadership are addressed using empirical literature: To what degree are motives for social dominance--and social docility--embedded in human nature and traceable through primate evolution? What traits and competencies distinguish leaders from followers, how early do these differences develop, and is the pattern the same for girls and boys, and for men and women, across the globe? How do some leaders and groups cultivate followers so devoted that they adhere to destructive directives? Contemporary problems in leadership provide illustrations. 2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

RELG 207," - Chinese Ways of Thought Provides an introduction to the Chinese worldview, examining Chinese philosophical and religious thought from the Warring States period (453-221 BCE), Neo-Confucian thought from the Song Dynasty (960-1279), and later periods. Classical Chinese thought was defined by the violence of the times and was therefore directed toward the question of how social harmony might be established and maintained. Later Confucian thought, under the influence of Buddhism, introduced additional questions about ethics and the human relationship to the cosmos. These intellectual traditions influenced generations of Chinese scholars and officials, and they also give insight into some of the unique aspects of Chinese society today. The course considers attempts by modern-day scholars ("New Confucians") to apply Chinese thought to contemporary ethical and political problems.

Scientific tinkering with food DNA heightens interest in "Frankenfoods," while genetic tinkering with animals has raised the spectre of "Frankenbeasts." The course foregrounds issues in the science of genetics and genethics—the social, ethical, legal, and, in this course, the notably religious implications of modern genomic and technological development - with an assessment of the promise and perils of these achievements for the future of humankind.

RELG 338," - Sex, Law, and the American Culture Wars Explores the American church-state debate through the lens of abortion, contraception, and same-sex marriage. These sexual freedom and reproductive rights issues raise questions that reach to the very heart of the American political project. What is the scope of our right to engage in private behavior? Do longstanding religious and moral traditions have a place within a secular legal system? Are there limits to the Constitution's guarantee of religious free exercise, and, if so, how do we determine these limits? These issues have generated intense social and political conflict, and are at the center of today's "culture wars" in the U.S. This course will provide students with a robust background in the legal history of these issues, and will furnish students with a framework for making sense of some of today's most contentious political battles in the U.S.  2018-2019 Colgate University Catalogue   ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This PDF is an extract of the full online catalogue as of August 1, 2018.

RELG 342," - Our Secular Age Do we live in a secular age? Most of us would assert that we do, but what do we mean when we make this claim? Are we referring to the political separation of church and state, to a decline in religious beliefs and practices, or to something else? These questions have recently come to occupy a central place within the study of religion. This course explores the topic of secularism from a variety of angles, including differing notions of what is meant by the term "secular"; an examination of the historical development of secular ideas and institutions; a comparison of different secular political projects; and a series of important critiques of secularism. This course encourages students to think critically and creatively about the relationship between "the religious" and "the secular," and it thus enhances students' understanding of religion, secularism, and modernity more broadly.

RELG 346," - Cognitive Science of Religion Central to much research in the cognitive science of religion (CSR) is the question of how the human brain and its evolved capacities inform and constrain the transmission of religious beliefs and ritual practices. The cognitive science of religion also seeks to answer why it is that certain beliefs and specific practices appear to outperform and outlive others. More generally, the CSR seeks to explain the persistence and pervasiveness of religious beliefs and practices throughout human history by drawing on the theories and methodologies of a range of disciplines, including cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, behavioral ecology, and several others, as well as disciplines more traditionally associated with the study of religion. Scholars in CSR embrace a variety of methods, including textual analysis, quantification of historical and archaeological data, statistical analysis of ethnographic data, controlled laboratory experiments, and mathematical modeling. This course is a survey of the most influential of the CSR theories and methods in the field.

SOCI 216," - Sociology of War In the modern world, war has usually been thought of as a clash between rival states. But, especially since WWII, much armed conflict has taken place between states and other kinds of entities — national liberation movements, criminal syndicates, warlords, terrorist groups. In an extreme case such as Somalia, states have totally disintegrated. This course asks what the consequences of this change are for our sociological understanding of the nature of warfare. It examines case studies of armed conflict in the present and recent past — Afghanistan, Kashmir, warlordism in West Africa, Northern Ireland, armed leftist movements in Western Europe during the 1970s; and in late colonial period and its aftermath, the Mau-Mau Rebellion, the Algerian war of independence, the Rhodesian War. A particular focus is on treating war as a cultural phenomenon, and to ask questions about the self-understandings of formal and informal military organizations and their consequences.

SOCI 324," - Medical Sociology Introduces students to the uniqueness of sociological perspectives in understanding health care, and the social factors that influence health care. Students employ several levels of analysis: social history, social interaction, work roles, organizations, organizational relationships, and social policy. The framework for this course is that of social organization to show that the social organization of a society influences, to some degree, the type and distribution of disease, illness, and death found in that society. The social organization of a society also influences, to a significant degree, how the system of medical care responds.

Questions of national identity, generational gaps, and gender, as they appear in Spanish literature from the late 19th century to the present day, are the focus of this course. Readings include works of prose, theater, and poetry drawn from a range of literary movements, and emphasis is placed on the socio-historical context and its relationship with literary innovation.

An appreciation for Victorian society reveals how Darwin's travels, career choices, scientific activities, domestic life, fragile health, and delayed publication of his evolutionary theory were shaped by the culture of the time. Examining the diverse and intense reactions to Darwin's "dangerous idea" shows how his theory has been extended far beyond biology to a broad range of intellectual disciplines. Seminar discussions are based on multidisciplinary assignments, student presentations, and interactions with invited speakers. These are enhanced by field trips to classic localities of geologic interest and to a natural history museum.

UNST 326," - Workshop of the World: Britain's Industrial Revolution in Regional Perspective (Study Group) A survey of key themes in the economic and social history of Britain during the classic period of the industrial revolution (c. 1740-1850) and later economic transformation (1851-c. 1939). The aims of the course are to encourage students to reflect upon debates that historians have engaged in relation to these themes, as well as to relate these broad themes to regional perspectives (e.g., emergence of the railway networks vis-a-vis regional specialization of industrial activity, the regional impact of the loss of export markets for British goods following the First World War, etc.). At the end of the course, students are able to identify interactions between the social, economic, and political processes that shape an industrial society, how historians often deal with conflicting evidence about the scope and extent of change, and reflect upon how the study of history can inform our understanding of social and economic change.
