Extraordinary: A History of Rowan UniversityRowan University has evolved from its humble beginning in 1923 as a normal school, with a mission to train teachers forSouth Jersey classrooms, to a comprehensive public research university with a strong regional reputation.In the early 1900s, many aspiring New Jersey teachers lacked proper training because of a shortage of schools in the statethat provided such an education. To address the problem in South Jersey, the state decided to build a two-year trainingschool for teachers, known then as a normal school.The town of Glassboro was an early favorite because of its excellent rail system, harmonious blend of industry andagriculture, natural beauty and location in the heart of South Jersey. Several towns in the region competed to be the site ofthe new normal school because of the economic benefit and prestige such an institution would bring.In 1917, to sway the decision in their favor, 107 Glassboro residents raised more than $7,000 to purchase 25 acres, which theyoffered to the state for free if the borough were selected as the site. The tract of land included the Whitney mansion (nowknown as Hollybush) and carriage house. Before the purchase, the entire property belonged to the Whitney family,prominent owners of the Whitney Glass Works during the 1800s. This show of support, along with the site's natural beauty,convinced the selection committee that Glassboro was the perfect location.A Strong FoundationIn September 1923, Glassboro Normal School opened with 236 students arriving by train to convene in the school's firstbuilding, now called Bunce Hall. Dr. Jerohn Savitz, the institution's first president, expanded the curriculum as the trainingof teachers became more sophisticated.Despite the rigors of the Depression, the program was expanded to four years in 1934, and in 1937 the school changed itsname to New Jersey State Teachers College at Glassboro. The college gained a national reputation as a leader in the field ofreading education and physical therapy when it opened a clinic for children with reading disabilities in 1935 and addedphysical therapy for the handicapped in 1944. The college was one of the first in the country to recognize these needs andwas in the forefront of the special education movement.Rowan's second president, Dr. Edgar Bunce, created a junior college program in 1946 to serve World War II veterans takingadvantage of the GI Bill.In the 1950s, Dr. Thomas Robinson, the University's third president, expanded the curriculum, increased enrollment andadded several buildings to the campus. In 1958, the school's name was changed to Glassboro State College to better reflectits mission.A Historic SummitThe University received worldwide attention when it hosted a historic summit conference between President LyndonJohnson and Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin in Hollybush. The University was chosen because of its strategic locationmidway between Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City, where Kosygin was scheduled to speak.The meetings between the two leaders, held June 23-25, 1967, presaged a thaw in the Cold War and eased world tensions.1ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA8Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (CMSRU)401 South Broadway, Camden, "
TALOG 2018,"-2019Rowan University In BriefRapid Growth to Serve NeedsThe University's fourth president, Dr. Mark Chamberlain, guided the college through its next phase of growth as enrollmentdoubled and G.S.C. became a multi-purpose institution. As new majors and a Business Administration Division were added,four divisions grew into schools and a board of trustees was formed. In 1969, the University opened a campus in Camden toexpand its educational services. With a 1978 Division III National Championship in baseball, the first of 11 nationalchampionships for the institution, the athletic program established itself as one of the premier athletic programs in thecountry.The college’s fifth president, Dr. Herman James, assumed the leadership of the institution in 1984. Under his direction,Rowan expanded by establishing the first doctoral program among the state's public institutions and adding the Colleges ofEngineering and Communication. Dr. James was also responsible for the construction of Campbell Library, the StudentRecreation Center and Rowan Hall, home to the College of Engineering.A Transformative GiftIn July 1992, industrialist Henry Rowan and his wife Betty donated $100 million to the institution, then the largest gift everto a public college or university. Later that year, the school changed its name to Rowan College of New Jersey to recognizeits benefactors’ generosity. The Rowans’ only request was that a College of Engineering be created with a curriculum thatwould address the shortcomings of engineering education.The college achieved University status in 1997 and changed its name to Rowan University under Dr. James’ leadership. TheCollege of Engineering quickly earned national accolades for its successful new curriculum.Dr. Donald J. Farish was appointed Rowan’s sixth president in July 1998. Under his leadership, the University implementedan aggressive improvement plan that addressed academic and student support initiatives as well as campus construction andrenovation projects.Major construction projects included the University townhouses; Science Hall; Education Hall; and the Samuel H. JonesInnovation Center, the first building of the South Jersey Technology Park at Rowan University.During his tenure, the University also entered into a public-private partnership that led to the construction of RowanBoulevard, a $400-million, mixed-use redevelopment project that links the campus with Glassboro’s historic downtown.The corridor features student and market-rate housing, a Barnes & Noble collegiate superstore, a Courtyard at MarriottHotel, an urgent care center and numerous retail and dining outlets. Work is underway on other facilities.A Broader MissionDuring this period, Rowan founded Cooper Medical School of Rowan University—the first new medical school in NewJersey in more than 35 years and the first-ever M.D.-granting four-year program in South Jersey—in partnership with CooperUniversity Health Care.The medical school welcomed its first class in the summer of 2012 into a new, six-story building adjacent to CooperUniversity Hospital in Camden. Close to 3,000 students applied for 50 spots in the medical school's charter class, whichgraduated in May 2016.The Board of Trustees named then-Provost Dr. Ali A. Houshmand as interim president in July 2011 and then theUniversity’s seventh president in June 2012.As provost, Dr. Houshmand established the College of Graduate and Continuing Education and started Rowan’s onlineeducation program, which now are part of Global Learning & Partnerships. As president, he dramatically reducedinstitutional expenses and increased revenue while expanding enrollment and academic programs.In 2012, several of the colleges were restructured and schools were created, among them the colleges of Business,Communication & Creative Arts, Education, Engineering, Humanities & Social Sciences, Performing Arts, and Science &Mathematics.In 2016-17, the University opened Holly Pointe Commons, freshman and sophomore housing strategically located on Rt.322, and new buildings for the William G. Rohrer College of Business and Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering, whichwill enable the high-demand programs to double their enrollment.N.J. Medical & Health Sciences Education Restructuring ActOn July 1, 2013, Rowan again changed dramatically when the New Jersey Medical and Health Sciences EducationRestructuring Act went into effect. The Restructuring Act designated Rowan as New Jersey’s second comprehensive publicresearch institution, transferred the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey’s School of Osteopathic Medicineto Rowan and partnered Rowan with Rutgers-Camden to create health sciences programs in the City of Camden.Rowan became the second institution in the nation to have both a D.O.-granting medical school (RowanSOM) and anM.D.-granting medical school (Cooper Medical School of Rowan University). The transfer of programs also led to thecreation of the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences and gave Rowan its third campus, with Stratford joining Glassboroand Camden, New Jersey, as homes to Rowan programs.Recognized NationallyFormerly considered a top Northern Regional University by U.S. News & World Report, Rowan for 2018 was reclassified a National University after securing Carnegie doctoral research university status. The magazine for 2018 ranked Rowan #90 among National public research universities and #171 overall (out of 311). U.S. News also ranked the Henry M. Rowan2ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019From Normal to Extraordinary: A History of Rowan UniversityCollege of Engineering #19 among undergraduate engineering schools, in which the highest degree offered is a bachelor's ormaster's, a 14-place improvement since 2014. The Princeton Review annually ranks the William G. Rohrer College ofBusiness among America’s best business schools.Growing OpportunitiesRowan continues to expand programs and partnerships to improve access to affordable four-year undergraduate degrees.Among the most recent was a June 2015 partnership with Burlington County College (now Rowan College at BurlingtonCounty), which followed a partnership two years earlier with Gloucester County College (now Rowan College at GloucesterCounty). The partnerships enable students to earn Rowan bachelor’s degrees at the community college or transferseamlessly to the University after earning an associate degree and meeting standards. Today, Rowan's approximately 19,000students can select from among 83 bachelors, 44 masters, six doctoral and two professional (medical) degree programs —along with undergraduate and post-baccalaureate certificates—in colleges and schools across three campuses.A rising research universitySince its 1923 founding, Rowan has enjoyed many truly big years but the past few have been extraordinary. Since the 2016-17school year, Rowan attained Carnegie classification as a doctoral research university, alumni Jean and Ric Edelmancommited $25 million to preserve and expand the Rowan University Fossil Park (which was renamed in their honor), theUniversity opened three new academic buildings and a privately built residence hall, added eight new academic programsand saw total enrollment and interest in the University continue to rise. From the modest Normal School begun 95 yearsago, Rowan has evolved into an extraordinary, comprehensive research institution focused on improving the quality of lifefor the citizens of New Jersey and the region.MissionRowan seeks to improve and expand the model for public higher education by being inclusive, agile and responsive, offeringdiverse scholarly and creative educational experiences, pathways, environments and services to meet the needs of allstudents; maintaining agility by strategically delivering organizational capacity across the institution; and responding toemerging demands and opportunities regionally andStrategic Pillars:AccessRowan is committed to expanding quality educational opportunities for students by increasing our enrollment capacity;supporting student success; utilizing an increasing array of pedagogies and platforms; and creating new pathways toundergraduate, graduate, post-graduate, and professional studies.AffordabilityWe are committed to keeping education affordable by managing costs, diversifying our revenue streams, limiting studentdebt, restricting tuition increases to the rate of inflation and enhancing internship and employment opportunities forstudents and graduates.QualityWe are committed to providing rigorous and engaging educational experiences; supporting scholarly, creative, and researchactivities; maintaining a vibrant and healthy campus life with a richly intellectual, cultural, and artistic environment andensuring a safe, supportive and inclusive culture that respects and values the diversity of all of our members.Economic EngineRowan is committed to benefiting our local and state communities by partnering with and investing in regional businessesand organizations that contribute to furthering our mission; preparing an educated citizenry and skilled workforce;enhancing the health of our citizens and the quality of life; and developing innovative products, services, and ideas.Using This CatalogRowan University has multiple catalogs:(cid:127)The Undergraduate Catalog includes the program requirements and course descriptions for all traditional-formatundergraduate programs (courses offered on-campus and across 16-weeks each term).(cid:127)The Global Learning & Partnerships (Rowan Global) Catalog includes program requirements and course descriptionsfor accelerated, online, and off-site undergraduate programs and all graduate and post-baccalaureate programs.(cid:127)The Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (CMSRU) Catalog describes the curriculum and policies for theDoctor of Medicine (MD) program.(cid:127)The Rowan University School of Osteopathic Medicine Catalog describes the curriculum and policies for the Doctorof Osteopathic Medicine (DO) program.(cid:127)The Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS) Catalog describes the curriculum and policies for the academicprograms offered by GSBS.3ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019MissionAcademic Calendar 2018-2019Fall Semester 2018Semester Classes BeginTuesday, September 4Thanksgiving Recess (no classes)Thursday-Saturday, November 22-24Semester Classes EndWednesday, December 12Reading & Review (no classes)Thursday, December 13Finals WeekFriday-Thursday, December 14-20 (includes Saturday, December 15)Flexible Time DayFriday, December 21Spring Semester 2019Semester Classes BeginTuesday, January 22Spring Break (no classes)Monday-Saturday, March 18-23Semester Classes EndThursday, May 2Reading & Review (no classes)Friday, May 3Finals WeekSaturday-Friday, May 4-May 10 (includes Saturday, May 4)Commencement WeekSaturday, May 11; Monday-Friday, May 13-17Summer Sessions 2019Memorial Day (no classes)Monday, May 27Fourth of July (no classes)Thursday, July 4Summer Sessions are Subject to Change.

To be considered for this program,students must submit the EOF Freshman application for admissions. These grants are renewable based upon continuedeligibility. Rowan University's Educational Opportunity Fund Offices on the Glassboro and Camden campuses can providemore information.In order to receive federal or state financial aid, all students at Rowan University must demonstrate satisfactory academicprogress towards the completion of a degree. At Rowan University, financial aid SAP is reviewed annually at the end of thespring term. The standards for financial aid SAP purposes are different from the academic requirements of the University.Financial Aid SAP reviews three progress standards; Grade Point Average (GPA), Completion Rate and Maximum Time Frameto degree completion.In some instances, students experiencing academic difficulty may find that they are permitted to remain in school; however,they may not receive financial aid until minimum standards are achieved. Individuals not meeting the financial aid SAPstandards are notified within 30 days of the spring term grade posting through the U.S. Postal Service.Individuals not making SAP have the right to appeal the denial of financial aid. Appeals can be based upon extenuatingcircumstances that occurred during the academic year or individuals not having extenuating or special circumstances canappeal based upon the submission of a developed “academic plan”. All appeals are reviewed by a committee. Decisions aremade to maintain compliance with federal guidelines.FEDERAL RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS POLICY Federal regulations require Title IV financial aid funds to beawarded under the assumption that a student will attend the institution for the entire period in which federal assistance wasawarded. When a student withdraws from all courses for any reason, including medical withdrawals, he/she may no longer beeligible for the full amount of Title IV funds that he/she was originally scheduled to receive. The return of funds is basedupon the premise that students earn their financial aid in proportion to the amount of time in which they are enrolled. Apro-rated schedule is used to determine the amount of federal student aid funds he/she will have earned at the time of thewithdrawal. Thus, a student who withdraws in the second week of classes has earned less of his/her financial aid than astudent who withdraws in the seventh week.Once 60% of the semester is completed, a student is considered to have earned all of his/her financial aid and will not berequired to return any funds.Federal law requires schools to calculate how much federal financial aid a student has earned if that student:(cid:127)completely withdrawals, or(cid:127)stops attending before completing the semester, or(cid:127)does not complete all modules (courses which are not scheduled for the entire semester or payment period for whichhe/she has registered at the time those modules began.)21ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019Division of Student AffairsBased on this calculation, Rowan University students who receive federal financial aid and do not complete their classesduring a semester or term could be responsible for repaying a portion of the aid they received. Students who do not beginattendance must repay all financial aid disbursed for the term.Scholarships Available to Incoming FreshmanRowan University rewards academic success through our scholarship program.

RowanSeminar courses are special sections of courses taken by first-year students (either General Education or major-specificcourses), many of which are popular with new college students and are reserved for first-year students only. Most majorprograms have designated specific courses for first year students. Students receive regular credit for successful completion ofthese courses.Extensive research on the first-year experience provides compelling evidence that the high school learning environment isnot always sufficient preparation for college-level learning. Our own research at Rowan suggests that although enteringfirst-year students believe they know what will be expected of them academically, many benefit from the careful attentiongiven to issues of transition from high school to college. Also, our research strongly suggests that participation increasesretention rates and four-year graduation rates among students who take Rowan Seminar courses.Rowan Seminar courses are designed to introduce students to the academic skills needed to succeed at Rowan and to collegelevel expectations of the learning process. What distinguishes a RS course from any other section of the same course is howthe course material is used to help each student understand academic expectations that accompany the college level learningprocess. Rowan Seminar courses are designated in a student's schedule with an RS after the title.Within the subject context of the course, the professor will introduce every student to the following skills, values, andexpectations at the college level:(cid:127)Strengthen writing and critical thinking skills through their application to specific course content(cid:127)Nurture library research skills within a course context(cid:127)Reinforce the value of cooperative learning(cid:127)Strengthen the academic skills needed for collegeRowan Seminar professors are typically experienced full-time faculty. They are chosen for their teaching skills, thoroughknowledge of their subject, familiarity with university policies and procedures, and their interest in helping new studentssucceed in college.

Academic policies governing the award of degrees for dual majors, concurrent, and successive degreeprograms are listed in the Rowan Handbook: www.rowan.edu/student_affairsGeneral Education at Rowan UniversityA well-rounded education is a goal in itself and there are important aspects of this education that the university as a wholewants to emphasize. These aspects include a thorough grounding in communication and an exposure to university levelscience, mathematics, social and behavioral science, and the humanities.Broadly speaking, the general education program will:1.Develop students' abilities to speak and write effectively, think clearly and critically2.Develop students' abilities to use computational, quantitative, and problem solving skills, as well as scientific thinkingand modes of inquiry3.Increase students' understanding of the complexity of issues in humanities, arts, social and behavioral sciences and thepractice of free inquiry in their analyses and examination of values.4.Provide opportunities for students to explore concentrations, minors, or disciplines outside of their own in greaterdepth.As one of the fundamental principles of a general education curriculum is to experience a variety of disciplines, students arerequired to take courses from five areas: Communication; Science and Mathematics; Social and Behavioral Sciences;History, Humanities, and Language; and Non-Program Courses.At Rowan University, the minimum number of hours required for a four-year degree is 120 semester hours, and all studentsare required to earn a combined total of 42 semester hours of General Education and Rowan Experience courses. (TheRowan Experience Requirements are described in detail in the next section.) Different degree programs vary in the numberof hours required for Free Electives and the Major. Students must plan their program of study in consultation with anadvisor in order to meet all the requirements of a specific major program.Within General Education, there are specific areas of study or discipline groups. All of the semester hour requirementslisted below are considered minimum requirements. Specific requirements may vary by degree type (Bachelor of Arts,Bachelor of Science) and/or by major program of study.General Education Requirements by Area of StudyFollowing are the minimum numbers of credits required in each of five areas of study within General Education. In additionto meeting the minimum credit hours in each bank, students must earn a COMBINED TOTAL of 42 credits of GeneralEducation courses and Rowan Experience courses.General Education AreasCommunication6Science and Mathematics7Social and Behavioral Sciences6History, Humanities and Language6Non-Program Courses6These are minimum requirements for each area of study or discipline group. Specific major programs may expand therequirements within any of these categories in order to meet program and learning outcome objectives as well as meetingthe minimum 120 semester hour requirement for a four-year degree. Specific General Education courses may be required forindividual majors if they serve as prerequisites for required courses within that major.General Education courses must be selected so that the following requirements are satisfied:1.All students must take College Composition I (3 s.h.) or Intensive College Composition I (4 s.h.) as well as CollegeComposition II (3 s.h.).2.The minimum of 6 s.h. of Communication is fulfilled by College Composition I and II. For all other banks requiring 6or more semester hours, students must take courses from at least two different disciplines within the bank.3.All students must take at least one course from the list of mathematics courses listed under Science and Mathematics.4.All students must take at least one approved course that includes an in-class laboratory experience (LAB) underScience and Mathematics.

In most situations, studentswill receive transfer credit for a combination of General Education Courses, Rowan Experience Courses, Free Electives, andMajor Requirements totaling at least 60 semester hours of credit or approximately one-half of a basic four-year degree.Exceptions to this assumption will occur when students have failed to complete required course work at the communitycollege that is required for entrance into a required Rowan University course. Coordination between the student and advisorat the community college is necessary in planning for the transfer to Rowan University. Specific program requirements areavailable on the Rowan University home page.For students transferring to the university without completing an Associate of Arts or Associate of Science degree, it isexpected that credits taken at a New Jersey community college that are applicable to an Associate of Arts or and Associateof Science degree will be transferable to the basic four-year degree program at Rowan University. Transfer students mustmeet the specific graduation requirements of the Rowan University degree program to which they seek to transfer. It isexpected that through careful planning, the transfer student will be able to meet these requirements within their two yearsof study at the community college and the following two years of study at Rowan University.General Education RequirementsGeneral Education is designed to fulfill the aim of a liberal education. It is intended to provide the breadth of knowledgeand balance of judgment befitting a college graduate, regardless of major. At Rowan University, General Education isdivided into five areas of study with specific goals. The educational goals of the five areas of study are:Communication Bank Goals1.Students will develop the ability to write a structured, well-reasoned, ordered and grammatically correct documentappropriate to the intended audience.2.Students will develop the ability to research and properly reference the work of others.Science and Mathematics Bank Goals1.Students will demonstrate an ability to identify and apply fundamental concepts in science and math.2.Students will demonstrate an ability to collect, interpret and verify lab data.3.Students will demonstrate an ability to analyze and manipulate data, and to access and organize information.History, Humanities, and Languages Bank Goals1.Students will demonstrate an understanding of major concepts, theories, and methods in at least two areas of history,humanities, culture, or world languages.2.Students will develop an understanding of systems of thought and language.Social and Behavioral Sciences Bank Goals1.Students will demonstrate an understanding of major concepts, theories, and methods in at least two areas of thesocial and behavioral sciences.2.Students will demonstrate an understanding of the development of human society as it relates to culture, geography,and language in the context of an emerging interdependent, global community.3.Students will demonstrate an ability to apply basic methodologies used in the measurement of social and behavioralsciences.Non-Program Electives Bank Goals1.Students will develop a deeper understanding of at least one area outside of the major program of study as a means ofcreating a broader, customized, and complete program of general education.2.Students will choose courses to enhance the major degree program and better prepare them to meet futureprofessional and life objectives.Some general courses offered at Rowan University fulfill one or more of the Rowan Experience Requirements, or areapplicable to the Honors Concentration, or meet a combination of General Education, Rowan Experience, and HonorsConcentration Requirements. Such courses are signified as follows:(ACE) Artistic and Creative Experience(H) Honors Concentration Course(LIT) Broad-based literature course(LAB) In-class laboratory experience(PS) Public Speaking(M/G) Multicultural/Global(RS) Rowan Seminar(WI) Writing IntensiveThe General Education course listing can be viewed in the Approved General Education Courses section of theuniversity catalog.36ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019Undergraduate ProgramsNon-Traditional-Format Undergraduate OfferingsRowan also offers a few of its undergraduate degree programs in non-traditional modes of delivery (online, off-site, hybrid,accelerated, etc.) through the Global Learning & Partnerships (Rowan Global).

Through Rowan Core, students willstrengthen their ability to be critical thinkers, intentional learners, and engaged citizens. Rowan University is an inclusive,agile, and responsive institution, and its graduates exhibit those same qualities.Rowan Core is organized around six literacies. Instead of emphasizing content coverage, a literacy framework promoteshabits of mind. Each literacy provides students with a greater capacity to participate in society—to access information, toanalyze and reflect, and to express conclusions and opinions. Learning is not only cognitive, but affective and experiential aswell. To be literate means both to have expertise in a subject area and to be able to practice that expertise. Students increasetheir literacy through the practice of four kinds of learning: acquisition of knowledge of concrete skills and content;understanding of concepts and theories; appreciation of values and dispositions; and engagement in applications andexperiences. For a listing of current Rowan Core courses, please visit rowan coreThe Rowan Core literacies are:(cid:127)Artistic Literacy(cid:127)Communicative Literacy(cid:127)Global Literacy(cid:127)Humanistic Literacy(cid:127)Quantitative Literacy(cid:127)Scientific LiteracyDuring their academic careers, new first-year students will take at least three Communicative Literacy courses and at leastone course from each of the other five literacies. Students are also required to take a minimum of 18 semester hours ofnon-program courses, which can either be additional Rowan Core courses or courses that were included in Rowan’s previousgeneral education model. Students must also fulfill the following Rowan Experience requirements:(cid:127)One Broad-Based Literature (LIT) Designated Course(cid:127)One Rowan Seminar (RS) Designated Course(cid:127)One Writing-Intensive (WI) Designated CourseAt Rowan University, the minimum number of hours required for a four-year degree is 120 semester hours, and all studentsare required to earn a combined total of 42 semester hours of Rowan Core and Non-Program courses. (Non-Programcourses are described in detail in the next section.) Some programs may have semester hour requirements that go beyondthese minimums. Students must plan their program of study in consultation with an advisor in order to meet all therequirements of a specific major program.Through development of each of the six literacies, Rowan University students prepare themselves to be engaged citizenswho contribute to their communities and create opportunities for personal success and fulfillment. The literacies are:Artistic LiteracyArtistic literacy is the knowledge and understanding of the centrality of the arts and aesthetics to human existence. Artreflects--and artists respond to and interact with—the communities in which we live. Artistic literacy requires learningabout and engaging in the creative and performing arts. Visual, verbal, physical and auditory expression will be informed by astudy of historical and cultural contexts. Active experimental engagement, including critical analysis and evaluation, willfoster an aesthetic sensibility, which includes cognitive and emotional responses.Communicative LiteracyCommunicative literacy is the capacity to analyze, reflect on, and respond to diverse communication situations. Thisincludes understanding the ways in which audience, context, and purpose shape acts of communication. Communicativeliteracy is demonstrated through fluency in various modes of communication and effective adaptation, invention, and choiceof strategies for communication. Engagement in a range of communicative acts and experiences will cultivate criticalawareness and ethical responsibility.37ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019Undergraduate ProgramsGlobal LiteracyGlobal literacy is the ability to understand the complexities of one’s own society as well as the global community. Thisrequires knowledge of the diversity of world cultures and recognition of the interdependence of the contemporary world.The extensive globalization of the world’s economies and societies reveals the limits of human and natural resources in aglobal context. Knowledge of the reciprocal nature of local and global conditions will produce an international perspective.Humanistic LiteracyHumanistic literacy is the ability to understand how human experience is shaped by economic, political, literary,socio-cultural, historical and other contexts. Humanistic literacy includes critical awareness of how dominant paradigms arecreated and shape human thinking and feeling. It also encompasses the ability to empathize with other times, places,cultures, and mindsets and to grasp the complexity of change and perspective. Active engagement involves theinterpretation of significant texts and artifacts to develop awareness and to use this awareness to make decisions and toinitiate and react to change.Quantitative LiteracyQuantitative literacy is the ability to reason logically and to communicate mathematical ideas verbally, symbolically, andgraphically. It involves knowing fundamental concepts and techniques of mathematical principles and processes in order tosee mathematical functions as quantitative relationships, to understand the concept of probability, and to estimate orapproximate answers to questions. This knowledge provides a foundation for understanding how to construct logicalarguments and how to make use of mathematical thinking. Quantitative literacy encourages appreciation of mathematics asa practical tool as well as a philosophical and humanistic endeavor which helps make sense of the world. Engagement inquantitative literacy includes analysis of the use of mathematics and the application of mathematical thinking and modelingto real-world problems.Scientific LiteracyScientific literacy is the understanding that science is a systematic, evidence-based process of observation, modeling, andtesting, to formulate and refine theories which not only explain but predict. Scientific literacy encompasses an appreciationof the role of science in society, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It includes recognition of the scientificknowledge, skills, and values that promote informed evaluation of the validity of claims and proposed solutions to currentproblems. Scientific literacy does not necessarily involve the production of new science but rather it enables one to makeinformed decisions and cooperatively engage in the protection and improvement of the world through scientific processes.The Rowan ExperienceCourses that fulfill the following three Rowan Experience requirements compliment the six literacies. These courses canalso fulfill General Education, Program, or Non-Program requirements:Rowan Seminar (RS).College is very different from high school; all Rowan first-year students are supported through this transition in their RowanSeminar course. Students build skills for success in college-level work and will engage with the Rowan community. Studentswho transfer in as sophomores, juniors, or seniors do not take Rowan Seminar courses.Literature (WI).In Literature courses, students engage with great works, whether modern or classic, American or from around the globe.Students build life-long skills and enjoyment for the literary world by taking at least one course from among selections in theEnglish Department, Philosophy and Religion Studies, and more.Writing Intensive (WI).The ability to write effectively is a core feature of a well-educated person, no matter the career field. Students’ writing skillswill be bolstered by these special courses emphasizing learning, and expressing one’s learning, through the writing process.Students can see the available courses in a given term by searching for the name of the bank under “Attribute” in SectionTally:LiteracyAttributeArtisticARTLCommunicativeCOMLGlobalGLBLHumanisticHUMLQuantitativeQNTLScientificSCILRowan ExperienceAttributeRowan SeminarRSLiteratureLit38ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019Undergraduate ProgramsWriting IntensiveWINote that specific academic programs may require additional courses in some literacies.

These interdisciplinary studies includeconcentrations, and courses that transcend the discipline of a single academic department.

Rowan Hall856.256.5310stanzione@rowan.eduThis concentration provides a mechanism to give students credit for their focused study in materials on their transcripts.Extending this opportunity to students is valuable to them because of growing industrial interest in these areas of chemicalengineering.In South Jersey, there are a number of local industries, such as Solvay Solexis, Metrologic, DuPont, and VWR Scientific,whose success is based on the application of materials science. Within the region, there are only a limited number of schoolsthat can supply qualified people to meet the needs of their labor force. By providing skilled graduates, this project willensure that these companies can meet these needs and allow them to expand their enterprises. The local economy has anever-increasing pressure for well-trained technicians, scientists, and engineers.Materials science is inherently multi-disciplinary, requiring of its practitioners a broad range of knowledge and a variety ofskills. Students in the proposed program will be able to follow the complete cycle of materials science from concept toresearch design to synthesis, to measurement of and explanation for the physical properties of the material to successfulapplication. Coupled with the organization of learning for chemical engineering students within the program comes adistinct and strong effort to motivate students to pursue careers in materials research. Ultimately, these efforts should helpus retain a diverse pool of talented students in New Jersey instead of being lost to out-of-state institutions.This concentration is a cohesive set of courses that focus on materials within chemical engineering. To obtain thisconcentration in materials, at least 12 semester hours of credit are required. The requirements to earn a concentration inmaterials are as follows:Course Credits12 s.h.Chemical Engineering Materials (CHE06.381)2 s.h.Jr/Sr Clinic Materials-related project (ENGR01.301, 302, 401, 402)4 s.h.ChE or Chemistry Elective - from approved list3 s.h.Out of Discipline Elective - from approved list3 s.h.In order to earn the concentration in materials, students can earn four credits by working on an approved materials projectin 2 semesters of Junior/Senior Engineering Clinic. These projects can be housed in any of the four engineering disciplines,but must be approved by the Chemical Engineering faculty as having substantial materials content. Note that students canalso fulfill the project requirement through independent study on materials-related projects (Independent Study inEngineering ENGR01.391).Students earn the remaining six credits towards the concentration by taking one elective from each of the following lists. Inorder to underscore the diverse applications and multi-disciplinary nature of materials science, we will require students totake one chemistry or chemical engineering elective, and one materials elective outside of chemical engineering. Note that achemistry course can be used to fulfill either requirement, but no one course can be used to fulfill both.

ThompsonAdvisorHenry M. Rowan Hall856.256.5310thompsong@rowan.eduThis concentration provides a mechanism to give students credit for their focused study in bioengineering. Extending thisopportunity to students is valuable to them because of growing industrial interest in these areas of chemical engineering. In1992, NIH defined "biomolecular engineering" as: "Research at the interface of chemical engineering and biology with an emphasis atthe molecular level."Recent trends in chemical engineering research, the decisions of government agencies, and the opinions of leadingacademics were taken as the platform for the development of the bio-related concentration.135ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019Henry M. Rowan College of EngineeringModern biology has emerged as an underlying fundamental science in chemical engineering. Advances in biology areprompting new discoveries in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical, medical technology, and chemical industries. Developingcommercial-scale processes based on these advances requires that new chemical engineers clearly understand thebiochemical principles behind the technology, in addition to developing a firm grasp of chemical engineering principles.Many jobs in the "Fast Company 25 Top Jobs for 2005" list are bio-related. Finally, New Jersey is a global and national leaderin the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.Instead of working at the "macro" scale, as traditional biochemical engineers have, there is a need for students to be able towork across scales - from the molecular level to the microscopic to the macroscopic. Traditional biochemical engineeringfocused on bioreactor design, agitation, and microbial cultures as a whole - macroscopic processes. Current and futureapplications will require students to be familiar with the molecular details of the product of interest, which help determinehow to design and operate microscopic and macroscopic operations for production and purification. This concentration is acohesive set of courses that focus on a biological engineering within chemical engineering and requires at least 12 semesterhours of credit. The requirements to earn a concentration in biological engineering are as follows:Course Credits12 s.h.Biology for Chemical Engineers (BIOL01.211)Jr/Sr Clinic Bio-related project (ENGR01.301, 302, 401 and 402)Electives - from approved listThe Biological Systems and Applications course is a required course in chemical engineering that was added as a response tothe growing national interest in biochemical engineering. This course is prerequisite for all subsequent work towards abiological engineering concentration.Junior/Senior Engineering Clinic is a required 2-credit course for students in all engineering disciplines. This course is ahallmark of the Rowan College of Engineering and provides undergraduate students with hands-on experience on practicalengineering research and design problems, frequently in collaboration with local industrial sponsors. All engineeringstudents are required to take four semesters (8 credits) of Junior/Senior Clinic. Students who wish to earn a concentration inbiological engineering must select an approved Junior/Senior Clinic project for at least one of their four semesters. Notethat students can also fulfill the project requirement through independent study on bio-related projects (Independent Studyin Engineering ENGR01.391).Because the department wishes to maintain a "depth and breadth" approach to the biological engineering concentration, astudent will not be allowed to apply more than 4 credits worth of Junior/Senior Clinic to their concentration.

Collectively, this industry hires more of the graduating Rowan Electrical and Computer Engineering(ECE) students than any other industry. The representatives of this industry have expressed a desire to provide additionalknowledge and skills set – specifically as they relate to combat systems – that they would prefer their employees to have atthe time hiring.The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Combat Systems Engineering is a program designed to meet this needand consists of four (4) three-credit undergraduate level courses. The program allows students to increase the breadth anddepth of their knowledge of complex systems with particular applications to combat systems and defense technologies.Completion of this CUGS will give students the necessary tools required by the defense industry in analysis, design,141ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019Henry M. Rowan College of Engineeringevaluation and validation of combat systems. Students who complete this CUGS will be more marketable and ready to beimminently employed at graduation by the defense and related industry companies, not just in our immediate geographicarea, but nationwide as well. This program is jointly developed by Rowan ECE and the defense industry representatives. Allcourses in this CUGS are taught by highly qualified faculty, including subject matter experts from the defense industry whohave significant industrial experience and hence bring unique industry perspective.The primary audience of this CUGS are(cid:127)students who are currently in the BS degree program in Electrical and Computer Engineering, who would like to focuson the combat systems engineering for employment in the defense industry (students may apply two of the requiredCUGS courses – ECE09.423 and ECE09.425 – towards the BS in ECE degree requirements).(cid:127)students in other related areas of engineering, who would like to focus on combat systems engineering foremployment in the defense industry. These students may need to complete relevant prerequisites of the requiredcourses.(cid:127)students at other institutions, or professionals already working in related industries, who are interested in expandingtheir knowledge and skill set in this area. Students in this group would be un-matriculated students.This CUGS program is available to any student in a Bachelor's degree program in electrical / computer / systemsengineering, or a related science / engineering discipline who is in good standing, or any professional with a bachelor’s (orhigher) degree in a relevant area.A graduate version of this program, as a Certificate of Graduate Studies (COGS) in Combat Systems Engineering is alsoavailable to qualified students.Program RequirementsRequired Courses(s.h.: semester hours/credit hours)Course #Course TitleS.

There are two track available in the Master of Science program (a)Thesis track and (b) Non-Thesis track. The thesis track of the Master of Science program is designed as a research-intensiveprogram and may not be amenable for the accelerated track. The non-thesis track of our Master of Science program isdesigned for students who intend to further their knowledge in the area of pharmaceutical sciences and hence it would beideally suited for the creation of an accelerated track. We propose an accelerated program in which high-achieving RowanBiochemistry majors can obtain the Bachelor of Science and Master of Science (non-thesis track) in a five-year period (ratherthan the traditional period of six years if both degrees were completed independently). This would create a “3+2” program inwhich students would be enrolled as undergraduates in the first semester of their fourth year but would enroll as graduatestudents in the second semester of the 4th year. By beginning graduate-level studies in their fourth year, highly talented andmotivated students will be able to complete both degrees on an accelerated timeline. The Bachelor of Science/Master ofScience dual degree program will enable students to obtain advanced graduate level training in the pharmaceutical sciences,which will prepare them for careers in industry or further graduate study.Identification of Courses The courses required for graduation is a combination of the required courses for the complete core of the Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree including Rowan general education courses (102 credits) as well as the246ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019College of Science and Mathematicsfull 31 credits for the Master of Science Pharmaceutical Sciences (non-thesis track) degree. This intends to use up to 18credits of the Master of Science courses toward fulfilling the required 120 credits for undergraduate degree completion. Thecomplete program will consist of 133 credits for the dual Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees as opposed to 151credits if both were done independently.Course requirements for the accelerated Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree ROWAN EXPERIENCE courses (allstudents are required to fulfill these requirements):1.Artistic and Creative Experience (ACE)2.Literature (LIT)3.Multicultural/Global (M/G)4.Public Speaking (PS)5.Rowan Seminar (RS)6.Writing Intensive (WI).

The graduate admissions committee in the Department of Chemistry andBiochemistry will review the applications and students will be notified by February 1. We plan to revisit and potentiallyfine-tune the details of the admission process two or three years after implementation to take into account the practicalaspects that might arise during the first few rounds of applications.Application for admission requires:(cid:127)A minimum overall GPA of 2.8 in undergraduate coursework(cid:127)A complete online CGCE application including personal statement(cid:127)A letter of nomination/recommendation from Department of Chemistry & BiochemistryGraduationTo graduate from the accelerated Bachelor of Science/Master of Science (non-thesis) dual degree program in Biochemistryand Pharmaceutical Sciences, students must meet the following requirements:(cid:127)Completion of all program requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry (maintain cumulative GPA of2.0).(cid:127)Completion of all program requirements for the Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences (non-thesis) (maintaincumulative GPA of 3.0 as well as obtain no grade less than B- in any of the graduate courses).(cid:127)Maintain satisfactory progress through the program. Upon completion of the requirements above, the student will begranted both a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and a Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Sciences.Student StatusStudents enrolled in the accelerated Bachelor of Science/Master of Science Program will pay undergraduate fees for allcourses until they have reached the required number of credits as part of the “3.5” years (i.e. 102 credits). Beyond this,students will pay graduate credit for graduate courses. Students will be able to take up to 6 credits of graduate courses at theundergraduate rate (senior privilege). Students must maintain full time student status during the entire 5-year program.Students will be expected to maintain satisfactory progress through the program. Satisfactory progress will be defined by thefollowing parameters:(cid:127)Earning at least a grade of B- in all the graduate courses.(cid:127)Any student who fails to maintain satisfactory progress as described above will be placed on probation within theprogram for one semester— if the performance still does not improve, he/she will be dropped from the graduateprogram. If the student has not already earned the Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, he/she will be re-admitted intothe Bachelor of Science subject to the requirements of that program.(cid:127)Students with extenuating circumstances may request an exception to this requirement by obtaining written approvalof the Program Coordinator of Master of Science Pharmaceutical Sciences as well as their Undergraduate Advisor, andother approvals if needed under University policy.Students who enter the accelerated Master of Science program but do not maintain satisfactory progress or opt-out of theMaster of Science degree will be allowed to apply up to 18 credits of Pharmaceutical Sciences coursework credits asrestricted or free electives toward the Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree. If the student opts out before 18 creditshave been completed in the Pharmaceutical Sciences program, any remaining credits to make up the required 120 credits forthe undergraduate Bachelor of Science Biochemistry degree will be taken using traditional coursework at the Glassborocampus.Accelerated Dual Degree (3 + 4 program): Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and M.D. degreeOverviewThe Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University (CMSRU) offer aBachelor of Science in Biochemistry and a Doctor of Medicine degree, respectively.

Statistician is a title sparkinginterest across all kinds of industries. Jobs in statistics are also growing fast as companies seek to fill more data-driven roles.The Certificate of Undergraduate Study (CUGS) in Statistics provides a sequence of courses that introduces students toanalyzing data with modern tools, and is designed to equip students with the analytical tools and capacities to neededinteract with real-world data in a research environment while also accommodating the foundation in the field.Statistics utilizes mathematics, yet it is a distinct discipline in many important dimensions. While both disciplines featurecritical thinking and problem solving, statistics requires its own set of analytic tools, and is by nature an interdisciplinaryfield. This interdisciplinary quality stems from the fact that a significant portion of all applied scientific and businessresearch relies heavily on statistical methods for purposes of inference and modeling through data analysis. Hence, there area large number of pre-requisite credit hours (6-12) of mathematics and computer science courses. However, students in thetargeted majors (STEM or business) are required to take some of the pre-requisite courses for their major, so must only takean additional 0-6 credit hours of pre-requisites outside their respective major.The CUGS in Statistics is only available students outside the Mathematics Major. The Mathematics majors can either picka statistics concentration or minor is statistics and operational research.Certificate of Undergraduate Study in Statistics12-13 s.h.The requirements include taking four courses in the following groups:Students must take one of (3-4 s.h):STAT02.261Statistics IISTAT02.320Concepts in Statistical Data AnalysisSTAT02.280BiometrySTAT02.284Statistics for the Biomedical SciencesSTAT02.290Probability and Statistical Inference for Computing SystemsStudents must take both of (6 s.h.):STAT02.340Elements of Statistical LearningSTAT02.350Regression AnalysisStudents must take one of (3 s.h):STAT02.371Design of Experiments: Analysis of VarianceMATH03.411Deterministic Models in Operations ResearchTo be awarded the CUGS in Statistics, students must complete all courses required for the CUGS in Statistics with at least a2.0 average.Department of Molecular & Cellular BiosciencesMary AlpaughDepartment Chair856.256.4500 ext. 53583alpaugh@rowan.eduMolecular and Cellular Biosciences is an interdisciplinary department that provides diverse training in computational skills,life sciences, and physical sciences.

NOTE: THIS PROGRAM MAY NOT BE OFFERED EVERY YEAR.Dual Degree (4 +1 program): B.S. in Bioinformatics + M.S. in Cell and Molecular Biology (SOM-GSBS).OverviewThis 4 +1 accelerated dual degree program allows high-achieving Rowan Bioinformatics majors to obtain the B.S. and M.S. ina five-year period (rather than the traditional period of six years if both degrees were completed independently). This wouldcreate a “3.5+1.5” program in which students would be enrolled as undergraduates in the first semester of their fourth year butwould enroll in graduate level courses in the second semester of this year. By beginning graduate-level studies in their fourthyear, highly talented and motivated students will be able to complete both degrees on an accelerated timeline. The B.S./M.S.dual degree program will enable students to obtain advanced graduate level training in the biomedical sciences which willprepare them for careers in industry or further graduate study.278ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019College of Science and Mathematics4 + 1 Undergraduate Program RequirementsBioinformatics Core Courses23 s.h.BINF07.250Introduction to Bioinformatics3 s.h.BINF05.355Bioinformatics - Biological Applications3 s.h.BIOL22.335Advanced Genetics4 s.h.CHEM07.348Biochemistry4 s.h.BINF07.599Advanced Bioinformatics - Biochemical Applications3 g.s.h.CS04.501Advanced Bioinformatics - Computational Aspects3 g.s.h.Thesis track: Masters Research I3 g.s.h.Introductory Science, Math and Computer Science Core54 s.h.MCB01.101Foundations in Biology for Biomedical Sciences I4 s.h.MCB01.102Foundations in Biology for Biomedical Sciences II4 s.h.CHEM06.100Chemistry I4 s.h.CHEM06.101Chemistry II4 s.h.CHEM07.200Organic Chemistry I4 s.h.CHEM07.201Organic Chemistry II4 s.h.MATH01.130Calculus I4 s.h.MATH01.131Calculus II4 s.h.STAT02.284Statistics for the Biomedical Sciences4 s.h.PHYS00.220Introductory Mechanics4 s.h.PHYS00.222Introductory E&M4 s.h.or PHYS00.221Introductory Thermodynamics4 s.h.CS04.103Computer Science & Programming4 s.h.CS01.205Computer Laboratory Techniques3 s.h.CS04.225Principles of Data Structures3 s.h.Focus Restricted Electives:12 s.h.*BIOL01.310Advanced Evolution4 s.h.BIOL01.405Conservation Biology4 s.h.BIOL01.428Developmental Biology4 s.h.BIOL01.430Advanced Cell Biology4 s.h.BIOL01.445Special Topics in Biological Sciences (WI)4 s.h.BIOL11.330Microbiology4 s.h.BIOL11.405Environmental Microbiology4 s.h.BIOL20.310Advanced Ecology4 s.h.MCB22.410Concepts in Human Genetics4 s.h.MCB22.450Molecular Genetics4 s.h.MCB01.306Translational Cell Biology Lecture4 s.h.MCB01.307Translational Cell Biology Lab4 s.h.MCB11.338Immunology4 s.h.MCB01.320Introduction to Virology4 s.h.MCB01.421Fundamentals in Cell Culture Techniques4 s.h.MCB10.345Human Physiology4 s.h.MCB01.414General Aspects of Infectious Agents4 s.h.MCB01.334Medical Biochemistry4 s.h.MCB01.201Molecular Biology Methods4 s.h.TBS01.230Translational Biomedical Research II3 s.h.CHEM08.305Biophysical Chemistry4 s.h.CHEM07.407Advanced Biochemistry Lecture3 s.h.CHEM07.409Advanced Biochemistry Laboratory2 s.h.CHEM07.431Advanced Topics in Biochemistry3 s.h.CHEM07.410Medicinal Chemistry3 s.h.CHEM08.410Survey Of Molecular Modeling Methods3 s.h.CHEM07.357Chemical Biology3 s.h.CS04.113Introduction to Object Oriented Programming4 s.h.CS04.114Object Oriented Programming and Data Abstraction4 s.h.CS04.222Data Structures and Algorithms4 s.h.CS06.205Computer Organization3 s.h.CS06.390Introduction to Systems Simulation and Modeling3 s.h.CS07.370Introduction to Information Visualization3 s.h.*CMB graduate courses taken as part of the accelerated B.S.-M.S. program will count toward and fulfill the remaining 6 s.h.Restricted Upper-Level Elective Course credit required for the BS Bioinformatics degree (see below).Rowan Experience, General Education, and Free Elective Courses32 s.h.279ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019College of Science and MathematicsFour approved graduate-level M.B.A. courses may substitute for any of the free elective courses.

The difference between these programs is the proportion of courses taken in the major field. For theB.A. degree, students take 33 credits in psychology while in the B.S. degree, students take 60 credits of psychology alongwith designated courses in math and science and hands-on experience in research methods. The B.A. degree providesstudents with a sufficiently strong background in psychology to pursue degrees in a variety of professions and graduateschool programs, while also affording them the opportunity to specialize in other areas through minors, concentrations, andCertificates of Undergraduate Studies (CUGS). The B.S. degree is designed for students who may be interested in pursuingresearch-oriented careers that may or may not require additional graduate training such as experimental psychology, andother areas within psychology. Both the Minor in Neuroscience (offered with Biological Sciences) and the Concentration inChild Behavioral Services are available to students obtaining either degree.All Psychology majors are expected to meet with their psychology department advisor at least once a semester. The purposeof these meetings is to discuss course selection, progress toward graduation requirements, academic planning, graduateschool plans, and career plans.Psychology majors may take up to 10% of their credit hours pass/no credit, including 6 s.h. in Psychology (students may nottake Psychology of Scientific Thinking, Research Methods in Psychology, Statistics in Psychology, Behavioral Assessmentand Measurement, Applied Behavior Analysis, Professional Issues in Applied Behavior Analysis, Advanced Research I orAdvanced Research II pass/no credit).BACHELOR OF ARTS IN PSYCHOLOGYDepartment of PsychologyRobinson Hall856.256.4870Face-to-face majors should email psychadvising@rowan.edu with any questions.

The School of Earth and Environment at Rowan University will play a role indeveloping solutions in these areas by cultivating faculty research and preparing students for careers in the geosciences,environmental sciences, planning, and sustainability. Students graduating from the School enjoy unparalleled opportunitiesto integrate classroom learning with hands-on experiences and will be superbly prepared for careers in industry, governmentagencies, professional studies, or graduate studies in related disciplines.The Jean and Ric Edelman Fossil Park, a unique world-class reservoir of ancient ecosystems near the Glassboro campus, is aliving laboratory and resource for education, research, and outreach. The Edleman Fossil Park offers students unparalleledopportunities for hands-on learning experiences and prominent research in paleontology. Because of the appeal of theEdelman Fossil Park and the importance of geosciences and environmental sciences to STEM outreach, the Schoolcoordinates with the Rowan University STEM Center to provide K-12 STEM outreach for the region.DepartmentsThe School consists of the Department of Geography Planning and Sustainability, the Department of Geology, and theDepartment of Environmental Science.Programs OfferedThe School offers the following undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies, Bachelor of Arts inGeography, the Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science (GIS), Bachelor of Science in Geology and theBachelor of Arts in Geology, Bachelor of Science in Community & Environmental Planning, Bachelor of Science inEnvironmental Science.Department of Environmental ScienceBeth ChristensenDepartment ChairHenry M. Rowan Hallchristensenb@rowan.eduEnvironmental science is the scientific study of the impact of human activities on natural systems. In order to address theseissues, environmental scientists are trained to apply tools and techniques from a variety of disciplines such as biology,chemistry, toxicology, geology, geography, engineering, and statistics. Included among the subjects in environmental scienceare evaluating alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and the effects ofglobal climate change. Over the past few decades, anthropogenic climate change has brought the imperative ofunderstanding earth system processes into sharp focus. Understanding the effect of sea level rise on coastal communitiesand wildlife is an important topic in New Jersey and includes the work of environmental scientists. Addressing the region’ssubstantial problems with toxic waste and environmental contaminants is a task for environmental scientists.308ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019School of Earth and EnvironmentStarting fall 2019, a BS in Environmental Science will be offered. Other undergraduate and graduate degrees inEnvironmental Science are under development.Department of GeologyHarold C. Connolly Jr.Chair and Professor215 Rowan Hall856.256.5261connollyh@rowan.eduGeology is the study of the Earth system, the materials of which the Earth is made, the origin and evolution of thosematerials, the processes acting upon them (both external and interior), and the origin and evolution of its organisms andecosystems. Geology investigates the relationship of how all components of the Earth interact within the Earth System.Lessons learned about the Earth system through geology are also applied to explore the origin and evolution of other bodiesin the Solar System. Central to geology is the study of how rocky bodies like the Earth have changed over time.The Department will begin offering two undergraduate majors starting fall 2017: the Bachelor of Science in Geology and theBachelor of Arts in Geology.BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN GEOLOGYThe Bachelor of Science in Geology is a physical science major composed of foundation courses in biology, chemistry,physics, and mathematics; core courses in geology; and electives in geology, applied geology, or paleontology. The program isdesigned to prepare students to immediately enter positions in the geoscience workforce in consulting firms or governmentagencies; pursue professional studies; or undertake graduate studies in geoscience disciplines.An important consideration for students seeking employment in industry is their ability to pass the Professional Geologist(PG) exam, after four to six years of work experience. Twenty-eight states now require a PG license for the submission ofcertain proposals and to sign off on reports and certifications submitted to environmental agencies. The Bachelor of Sciencecurriculum is designed to provide students with the background necessary to succeed on this exam.General EducationAll students starting before Fall 2018 and transfer students must complete the University General Education Requirementsas described on page 35Rowan CoreAll first-time Freshmen starting in Fall 2018 or after must complete the University Rowan Core Requirements as describedon page 37Rowan ExperienceAll students must complete the Rowan Experience requirements as described on page 38Required CoursesGEOG16.100Earth, People, and the Environment*3 s.h.STAT02.260Statistics I*3 s.h.CHEM06.100Chemistry I*4 s.h.CHEM06.101Chemistry II4 s.h.MATH01.130Calculus I4 s.h.MATH01.131Calculus II4 s.h.PHYS00.210Physics I4 s.h.BIOL01.104Biology 1: Diversity, Evolution, and Adaptation4 s.h.or PHYS00.211Physics II4 s.h.GEOL01.101Physical Geology4 s.h.GEOL01.102Historical Geology4 s.h.GEOL01.201Mineralogy and Petrology4 s.h.GEOL01.210Invertebrate Paleontology4 s.h.GEOL01.230Paleoclimatology4 s.h.GEOL01.240Introduction to Field Methods4 s.h.GEOL01.301Advanced Field Methods4 s.h.GEOL01.320Sedimentology and Stratigraphy4 s.h.GEOL01.340Structural Geology4 s.h.GEOL01.350Advanced Petrology4 s.h.GEOL01.400Practical Experience in Geology6 s.h.GEOL01.450Senior Seminar in Geology4 s.h.GEOL01.460Current Research in Geology1 s.h.309ROWAN UNIVERSITY UNDERGRADUATE CA-2019School of Earth and EnvironmentGEOL01.470Research Experience in Geology2 s.h.*Part of Rowan Core requirementsGeology Concentration Courses16 s.h.Students select one of the following Concentration Areas:(cid:127)General Geoscience(cid:127)Applied Geology(cid:127)Paleontology </bulletdRestricted Electives6 s.h.Geology courses OR approved Biology, Geography, Physics courses (a maximum of 2 sh of GEOL01.470 may count towardthis requirement)Total Semester Hours120 s.h.BACHELOR OF ARTS IN GEOLOGYThe Bachelor of Arts in Geology is a physical science major composed of foundation courses in biology, chemistry, physics,and mathematics; core courses in geology; and electives in geology or related disciplines.
