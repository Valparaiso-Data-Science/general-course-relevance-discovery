From Analog to Analogue: Digitality and Ephemerality inAudiovisual Archives.This seminar explores histories of moving image and sound archives inrelation to social movements, technological change, and philosophies ofcultural memory and value that dictate the content of archives and shapeperceptions of their use value. We begin by exploring archives as physicalentities (buildings), structures of information (catalogs, databases, findingaids) and arbiters of meaning (collections). We also consider *enterprises*that increasingly present themselves as archives of our contemporaryselves and collective existence: Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, YouTube,Twitter. As well as exploring these issues historically and theoretically, wewill visit local archives and engage in hands on activities.SprMCM1204KS0125904TTh10:30-11:50(09)’To Be Arranged'"

At the end of the junior year, each student should meet with the Directorof Undergraduate Study (DUS) to review their plan for completing theircapstone.  If pursuing a capstone project, students will be required tosubmit, by the end of the shopping period of the fall of their senior year,  ashort proposal (300 words) that describes how they are going to completethis requirement.An Honors Thesis is a two-semester independent study supervised by athesis advisor ().  These two courses constitute the additionalcourses needed for honors in the concentration.An honors thesis can be textual, or it can take other forms (multi-media,visual, artistic, or musical, for example).  The form and substance of a non-textual honors thesis must conform to the rigorous regulations set out bythe relevant department(s) and the Dean of the College.Additional Honors RequirementsTo be eligible for Honors, students will have earned an "A" in the majorityof courses for the concentration.Students may graduate with Honors in South Asian Studies by completingan undergraduate Honors thesis under the supervision of at least onereader drawn from the CCSA faculty* and one additional reader from theBrown (or RISD, in the case of Brown-RISD students) faculty community.In order to pursue Honors, students must submit the following materials tothe CCSA DUS by April 25:1.A prospectus (3-5 pages, describing the major research questions andmethods to be used, complete with bibliography) that has been readand vetted by the student's intended primary reader. 2.An email from the faculty member who will serve as primary reader tothe CCSA DUS noting their willingness to advise on the thesis. In addition, students must:1.Enroll in a two-semester sequence of Independent Study, or under a relevant depawrtment course code2.Designate a second reader by September 30 of the senior year. Second readers should also confirm their willingness to serve as areader by sending an email to the CCSA DUS.  3.Be in regular contact with the thesis advisor about the progress of theproject.4.Present their research to the CCSA community during their finalsemester. For mid-year graduating students, the topic and primary reader must beidentified and confirmed by mid-November of the junior year, and a secondreader must be arranged and confirmed by January 30 of the senior year.A complete penultimate draft of the thesis is due to both readers on April1.  A final draft that incorporates readers' comments is due back to thereaders on April 15 of the student's senior year.* This includes all people listed under the Faculty, Postdoctoral Associate,and Visiting Scholars (limited to those in residence at Brown) tabs on theCCSA website.StatisticsThe Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics is designed to providefoundations that include basic statistical concepts and methodologies,and to expose students to the role of statistical thinking and analysisin interdisciplinary research and in the public sphere. To ensure deeprigorous understanding of the foundations and main methods of analysisin statistics, the program is composed of three parts: a) foundations inmathematics and computing, combined with an introduction to statisticalthinking and practice; b) four core courses on the fundamentals ofstatistical theory and data analysis; and c) more advanced materialcovering important areas of statistical methodology. A capstone projectinvolving substantial data analysis or focused on methodology/theory isrequired. Students also have opportunities to acquire practical experiencein study design, *data management*, and statistical analysis by working asundergraduate research assistants in projects in one of the participatingacademic departments or Research Centers at Brown.The Concentration is based on several premises: that statistics is ascientific discipline in its own right, with specialized methodologies andbody of knowledge; that it is essentially concerned with the art andscience of data analysis; and that it is best taught in conjunction withspecific, substantive applications. To this end, the Concentration isdesigned to provide foundations that include basic statistical conceptsand methodologies, and to expose students to the role of statisticalthinking and analysis in interdisciplinary research and in the publicsphere.  The Concentration prepares students for careers in industryand government, for graduate study in statistics or biostatistics and othersciences, as well as for professional study in law, medicine, business, orpublic administration. The undergraduate concentration guide is availablehere (https://www.brown.edu/academics/public-health/biostatistics/undergraduate-statistics-concentration).The Undergraduate Concentration in Statistics is administered by theDepartment of Biostatistics and leads to a Sc.B. degree. To ensuredeep rigorous understanding of the foundations and main methodsof analysis in statistics, the program is composed of three parts. Thefirst part entails foundations in mathematics and computing, combinedwith an introduction to statistical thinking and practice. The second partincludes four core courses that provide a comprehensive account ofthe fundamentals of statistical theory and data analysis. The third partdelves into more advanced material covering important areas of statisticalmethodology. In addition to the formal coursework, students are requiredto complete a capstone project that involves a substantial data analysisor a methodological/theoretical project.  Students also have opportunitiesto acquire practical experience in study design, *data management*, andstatistical analysis by working as undergraduate research assistants inprojects in one of the participating academic Departments or ResearchCenters at Brown.

Students taking an internship for creditshould register for an Individual Research Project ().The Senior SeminarSocial Analysis and Research requires all concentrators to completea thesis or capstone project in their senior year. The purpose of thethesis or capstone project is to allow students an opportunity to applythe knowledge they acquired on a topic of their own interests. To fulfillthis requirement students enroll in  (http://bulletin.brown.edu/search/?P=SOC%201970) to meetthe concentration course requirements. This course counts towards a1000 level substantive requirement and will not serve as a substitute forany of the core concentration requirement.SociologyThe concentration in Sociology (leading to a Bachelor of Arts) providesa foundation in sociological theory and methods and the opportunityto cultivate more specialized knowledge in the discipline’s substantiveinterests. Students develop that focus through their coursework,taking courses in diverse areas such as social inequality, family andgender, organizations, environmental sociology, race and ethnicity andglobalization.  Students refine their interests during the senior seminarand through their completion of a senior thesis or capstone project. Theconcentration also allows students to pursue the Engaged ScholarsProgram (https://www.brown.edu/academics/college/special-programs/public-service/engaged-scholars-program) (ESP).
