As a scholarly community it actively engages in the exploration, transmission and enlargement not only of knowledge but also of the cultural and religious heritage of human society, and it is proud to prepare men and women for professional service. This community values respect for learning and truth, for human dignity, for freedom from ignorance and prejudice, and for a critically inquiring spirit. The University aims to develop in its members these values, together with a sense of vocation and social responsibility. It holds that these values receive their deepest meaning and strength within the context of the Christian faith. These basic commitments enable Valparaiso University to graduate students whose individual achievements and aspirations are linked invariably to larger social, moral, and spiritual horizons of meaning and significance. Proud of all its alumni who have carried its values into leadership roles in their communities, the church, social institutions, the nation, and the world, it aims to continue graduating such potential leaders. A Distinctive Institution All American colleges and universities bear a family resemblance to one another as they come from a common set of ancestors in Europe and colonial America. Within that larger family, Valparaiso University belongs to a small and distinctive group. It is neither a large research university nor a small liberal arts college. At the same time that it promotes a basic liberal arts curriculum, it features strong undergraduate colleges of Engineering, Nursing and Health Professions, and Business, a professional direction lacking in the conventional liberal arts college. Conversely, the University is not a cluster of professional colleges which merely pays lip service to the liberal arts. Education in the liberal arts is the foundation of every academic program, and the College of Arts and Sciences, the largest unit in the University, carries on many vital programs of its own. This combination of liberal and professional studies of such variety within an institution of modest size is rare in American higher education. Broad enough in curriculum and in variety of programs to be a university, still Valparaiso University emphasizes undergraduate teaching in the manner of the traditional small college, with many small classes and strong individual guidance. Valparaiso University is also a founding member of the New American Colleges and Universities, a national consortium of small to mid-sized colleges and universities that are committed to the ideal of integrating liberal and professional studies. Valparaiso University's unique status as an independent Lutheran university supplies the rationale for this special combination of liberal and professional studies. No church body has control or authority over the University, which is owned and operated by the Lutheran University Association. Valparaiso University is therefore both free and responsible to realize an educational ideal informed by the best traditions of Lutheran Christianity and of liberal and professional studies. Faith and Learning The University’s concern for the personal and intellectual development of each student is rooted in its Lutheran heritage. This Christian philosophy of education guides both the design of its curriculum and the approach to learning that it fosters. Beyond the courses in theology that the curriculum provides, the University emphasizes a Christian freedom that liberates the scholar to explore any idea and theory, a vocation freely uniting faith and intellectual honesty. In its residential life the University leads students to accept personal responsibility for their development and encourages a sense of caring for one another. Standing together at the center of the campus, the Chapel of the Resurrection and the Christopher Center for Library and Information Resources express the University’s belief in the creative relationship between faith and learning. The University’s motto, too, points up this relationship: In luce tua videmus lucem, "In Thy light we see light." The chapel is the focal point for worship, the proclamation of the Gospel, and many cultural events. Both Sunday and daily services bring together members of the University community who choose to worship together. Students and professional chapel staff offer a broad and creative ministry to the whole community. As the University welcomes students of varied denominations and religious traditions, so it welcomes the involvement of community churches in those students’ lives. A Roman Catholic student center, for example, is located next to the campus, and some churches of other denominations offer transportation to their services in the town. The Setting of the University The spacious campus of 320 acres contains more than sixty academic and residential buildings, many of them built within the past two decades. The campus is located in the small city of Valparaiso, attractively situated in a rural setting at the edge of the busy industrial district of Northwest Indiana. Fifteen miles to the north, on the shore of Lake Michigan, are the Indiana Dunes. The city of Chicago with its vast cultural resources, an hour’s drive from the campus, can be reached easily by train and bus. The University Valparaiso in Brief 9 often charters buses so that students and faculty can take advantage of the theatres, museums, and other educational benefits of this great city. Many programs of the University use the region--rich in natural, urban, and industrial opportunities for field trips and investigative activities. An Unusual History In its 150 year history, the University has passed through three distinct phases. Begun by Methodists in 1859 as an institution pioneering in coeducation, the Valparaiso Male and Female College was forced by the reverses of the Civil War to close its doors in 1871. It was revived in 1873 by an enterprising educator, Henry Baker Brown, as the Northern Indiana Normal School. "Mr. Brown’s School," a flourishing private, proprietary institution, was renamed Valparaiso College in 1900 and rechartered as Valparaiso University in 1907. During the next twenty years, it won national recognition as a low-cost, no-frills institution of higher learning which served thousands of students who might not otherwise have been able to afford a good education. Many alumni from this period achieved distinction in their fields as governors, legislators, scientists, business leaders, and other professionals. However, after World War I the University went into decline and bankruptcy; then, in 1925, The Lutheran University Association purchased it, beginning the modern phase of the University’s history. The association, an Indiana corporation composed of men and women, the majority of whom are affiliated with Lutheran congregations, is a national organization whose members represent the principal regions of the United States. Profile of Students and Faculty The heart of an academic institution is its students and faculty. Valparaiso University’s student body is selected from a large number of applicants from all states in the nation and from many foreign countries. Unlike most American colleges, which draw the majority of their students from their immediate location, Valparaiso University enrolls 42% of its undergraduate students from Indiana; another 48% of undergraduates come from Great Lakes states. Major contingents come, too, from both East and West coasts. National and diverse in its student body, the University is still a distinctively Midwestern institution which enjoys the friendliness and hard work characteristic of the region. Over 57% of the students come from the upper fifth of their high school graduating classes. Approximately twenty National Merit Scholars are enrolled at the University in any given year. A rich diversity characterizes the University faculty (312 full-time and 102 part-time professors), but they share important skills and attitudes as well. Educated at leading research universities, they are competent in their fields. They care about students, an attitude made visible by the frequent individual consultations they invite. Above all, they enjoy teaching and believe that their work enriches not only their students’ but their own lives. At Valparaiso University there are no teaching assistants; senior faculty members and newcomers alike can be found teaching introductory and advanced courses. The University embodies in its faculty an ideal of the teacher-scholar, one who recognizes that teaching is based on continuing scholarship. Many members of the faculty have achieved significant reputations in their particular fields and are pursuing, with marked success, grants from government and private foundations to promote research and improve instruction. In addition to The Cresset, a periodical review of literature, the arts and public affairs, published by the University, faculty edit from the campus two other national learned journals. University governance, too, reflects campus-wide involvement. Through the University Council, composed of faculty, students, administrators, and staff, students share in the development of University policy, including academic programs. Final responsibility for all academic programs, especially those which require certification, is vested in the faculty. The modest size of the University, its organization into five small undergraduate colleges, a school of law, and a school of graduate studies and continuing education, and especially the strong personal commitment of the faculty enhance its teaching effectiveness. In a school like this, with its concentrated residential focus and the immediate relationships it fosters between faculty and students, educational life is more vital and more intense than would be possible at massive institutions or at commuter colleges. Valparaiso University consciously fosters this tradition in the selection of both its students and its faculty and in the development of its educational programs.   10 Academic Programs The Goals of Education at Valparaiso University While appreciating the importance of preparing students for useful careers, Valparaiso University holds to the ideal that its students want an education which treats them first as human beings rather than simply as future wage earners. These students want to think clearly, to analyze facts and ideas, to draw sound conclusions from their reasoning and to express themselves clearly and creatively. They want to understand their cultural and religious heritage, developing a sensitivity to the culture and the viewpoints of others, while finding for themselves firm values and standards by which to live and make judgments. They want to become humane and responsible citizens in an ever changing society and to participate effectively in their institutions and communities. There is no simple formula for acquiring these abilities. Every degree program at Valparaiso University aims to assist students to attain these goals by offering a course of studies in general education which provides students with a broad base of knowledge and abilities, as well as in a particular area which leads to the mastery of concepts and tools of a single field of study. Both components, general education and the major field of studies, develop abilities in the student which go far beyond mere career preparation and provide intellectual enrichment for a lifetime. University-Wide Student Learning Objectives Through the following student learning objectives, Valparaiso University affirms its mission-based commitment to educate responsible global citizens who are ready to lead and serve church and society. These objectives are designed to help colleges and departments clearly link their student learning objectives to those of the University. All academic units will indicate how the learning outcomes of their curriculum and of individual courses within that curriculum link to some, or all, of the University-wide student learning objectives. The objectives are designed to include the cognitive, skill, and value domains of learning.  Students will: 1. Demonstrate theoretical and practical knowledge as well as the intellectual skills and creative capacities pertinent to their respective fields of study. 2. Solve both conceptual and applied problems by integrating broad-based knowledge, evidence-based reasoning, and informational literacy. 3. Practice experiential, interdisciplinary, and collaborative learning in both academic and co-curricular pursuits. 4. Communicate effectively in oral, written, and digital forms in increasingly complex contexts. 5. Engage in cross-cultural dialogue and experiences with the requisite knowledge to succeed in a diverse, global community. 6. Develop character, integrity, and wisdom as they discern their vocations and prepare to ethically lead and serve church and society.   Academic Programs 11 Degrees Undergraduate Degrees Associate of Arts Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering Associate of Science Bachelor of Science in Education Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Science in Health Care Leadership Bachelor of Liberal and Professional Studies Bachelor of Science in Health Science Bachelor of Music Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering  Bachelor of Music Education Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering Bachelor of Science Bachelor of Science in Nursing Bachelor of Science in Business Administration Bachelor of Science in Physical Education Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering Bachelor of Science in Public Health Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering Bachelor of Social Work Graduate Degrees Doctor of Nursing Practice  Master of Health Administration Education Specialist  Master of Public Health Master of Arts  Master of Science  Master of Arts in Liberal Studies  Master of Science in Nursing  Master of Business Administration  Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies Master of Education  Law Degrees Juris Doctor   Master of Laws  Requirements and Flexibility Each degree entails a set of requirements which are specified at appropriate places in this bulletin.

The Freshman Year Even though they may express clear-cut decisions, college freshmen are often uncertain about their long-range career goals. The University fosters this openness by encouraging them to discover new interests while cultivating their current ones. All students, with the help of their academic advisors, design a program that allows them first to explore various areas of interest and, in due time, to develop a plan of study focusing on a major area of interest. The Valpo Core Course The Valparaiso Core Course is a two-semester, ten credit course required of all first-year students not enrolled in the Christ College Freshman Program. The primary subject of this interdisciplinary course is the human experience as great thinkers, writers, and artists have represented it. The primary object of the course is to welcome and initiate new students into this University community and academic life generally, by putting them in dialogue with great teachers and great texts, and of course, with each other, to explore together some of the most essential aspects of human existence, past, present, and future. The course is interdisciplinary because knowledge is interdisciplinary, and in the global community we now live in the world depends increasingly on people able to make connections across disciplines, across cultures, across oceans, across town. To prepare our students to succeed in this world and live meaningful lives of leadership and service, we recognize the need to introduce them to cultures and traditions other than their own. The reading list is multicultural and international because the world is multicultural and international. At the same time, we recognize the need to help students discover where they come from and where they are, which for the majority means exploring the Judeo-Christian intellectual tradition of the West, which produced, among other great things, this University. Hence, at the core of this Core Course, in the best spirit of Lutheran higher education, is the desire to create dialogues of texts and traditions, and to help our students grow in their understanding of how the past speaks to the present, how the sacred informs the secular. First-year students need special skills to enter fully into this dialogue and become successful students in the fullest sense. The Valpo Core is designed to help students develop those skills necessary for them to thrive in their studies, skills in close reading and critical thinking, in speaking, and especially in writing. Great opportunities also exist in the course for students to become more adept at retrieving, evaluating, and managing information, as they hook up to the rest of the world through our electronic information services. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of the Core Course, some institutions experience difficulties determining how to apply these credits toward their own general education requirements. "

Wellness and Stress 1 Cr. B. Major Field Requirements  Students may fulfill the major field requirements of the Bachelor of Arts degree by completing either a Departmental Major or an Individualized Major and by meeting one of the completion requirements listed below; or by completing an Interdisciplinary Program (see page 53).   College of Arts and Sciences 52 Departmental Major In order to fulfill requirements under the Departmental Major, students must complete a minimum academic major but may not exceed 60 credits in any one subject. For a list of the academic fields of study, see page 12. Individualized Major An approved individualized major of thirty credit hours may be presented instead of the departmental majors listed above. This major is intended for students with clearly defined academic or career objectives who feel that their specific needs are not met by the departmental major option nor by the interdisciplinary program option described below. A student in the College of Arts and Sciences may propose a plan for an individualized major, using the form available in the Office of the Registrar’s website. The major must satisfy the following conditions. 1. The proposed major must include at least 30 credit hours but not more than 48 credit hours chosen from two or more departments. 2. The proposed major must be accompanied by a minor within a discipline listed in the GENERAL CATALOG. 3. None of the courses chosen may be courses used to meet the General Education requirements. 4. Courses taken for this major may not be counted for credit towards a minor or second major. 5. The proposed major must be supported and supervised by a faculty advisor. 6. A comprehensive rationale statement by the student justifying the major must accompany the Individualized Major form. This form must list the specific courses to be taken and be signed by the student and the faculty supervisor before it is presented to the Dean’s Office for approval. Any revisions must also be approved by the dean of the college. 7. The proposed major must be submitted to the dean of the College of Arts and Sciences for approval, preferably by the beginning of the junior year, but no later than November 1 for December degree candidates and April 1 for May or August degree candidates. The selection of courses for the individualized major should reflect serious deliberation on the part of the student and advisor. Normally, the individualized major will not include lower division courses or courses of an introductory nature. The individualized major may be freely substituted for a departmental major in any of the various combinations available to students in meeting major requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree only. The individualized major may not be used to meet the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree. Students may not pursue Honors Work as part of an individualized major. Completion of Major Field Requirement In addition to completing either a departmental or an individualized major, students must complete one of the following: 1. An academic minor. The faculty recommends that minors be selected that are correlated to the major. No course may be used to fulfill two majors or both a major and a minor requirement except with the permission of the dean of the college. This restriction refers to courses within the major or minor field, not to additional courses required from outside of the major or minor field. 2. An approved individualized minor. 15 credit hours may be presented in lieu of the departmental minor. At least 9 credit hours must be taken beyond the introductory level. None of the courses chosen may be courses used to meet the General Education Requirements. Forms for individualized minors are available in the Dean’s Office. A student may not graduate with both an individualized major and an individualized minor as the method of fulfilling major area graduation requirements. 3. A second academic major. A second major may be chosen from Departmental Major options or an interdisciplinary program. An approved individualized major may also be presented in fulfillment of requirements of a second major, unless the first major is also an individualized major. Only one individualized major or minor may be applied to the major field requirement. 4. A complementary major. A major which enhances and expands a first major. This major may not be a first major. 5. A first major with at least forty credit hours. However, no more than sixty credit hours from one subject area may be applied toward the 124 required for graduation. Students may not complete an individualized major of forty credits or more to satisfy the major field requirement. The limitation does not apply to students pursuing the Bachelor of Music or Bachelor of Music Education degrees, or the Bachelor of Physical Education degree with a major in Teacher Education. 6. An interdisciplinary minor, see listing below.   College of Arts and Sciences 53 Interdisciplinary Programs The College of Arts and Sciences offers several interdisciplinary programs of study which students may pursue instead of the major options outlined above. These programs are coordinated by special administrative committees composed of faculty members drawn together by their interest in a particular subject not defined by boundaries of the traditional academic disciplines. Interdisciplinary Programs are currently offered in Actuarial Science, Chinese and Japanese Studies, *Data Science*, Environmental Science, International Economics and Cultural Affairs, Global Service, Latin American/Latino Studies, and a complementary major in Theology and Ministry. In addition, minors in interdisciplinary programs in Applied Statistics, Business Administration, *Business Analytics*, Cinema and Media Studies, Environmental Studies, Ethnic Studies, Forensic Science, Fundamentals of Business, Gender Studies, Human Aging, Peace and Social Justice Studies, Philanthropic Leadership and Service, and Urban Studies may be added to departmental majors. Bachelor of Liberal and Professional Studies Degree (124 Cr.)

Only courses of at least three credits may be used in meeting General Education Requirements, excluding the requirement in Kinesiology. 3. Courses taken to fulfill major requirements (departmental majors or interdisciplinary majors) may be presented in fulfillment of General Education Requirements where applicable. Restrictions on the Use of Credit Hours for Degrees in the College of Arts and Sciences 1. A student may apply no more than four credit hours in Kinesiology 100 or Activity Courses toward a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. 2. Non-music majors are limited to 16 total credit hours of applied music (studio instruction and/or ensemble). For further clarification see page 221. 3. No more than 60 credit hours in any one subject may be applied toward the total of 124 credit hours required for graduation, each subject being identified by the 2-4 letter code preceding each course number in the catalog (e.g., COMM, MUS, KIN, THTR). This limitation does not apply to students pursuing: a. the Bachelor of Music degree b. the Bachelor of Music Education degree c. the Bachelor of Physical Education degree with a major in Teacher Education 4. A student may apply no more than 16 credit hours of ROTC coursework toward a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. These credits may be used as free electives only. 5. A student may apply no more than 30 credit hours collectively from the professional colleges of the University toward a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. Furthermore, no more that 15 of these credits may be included within an Individualized Major. In that case, any remaining professional college credits, up to the maximum of 30, may only be counted towards electives and general education requirements. College of Arts and Sciences 60 Professional and Pre–Professional Areas The College of Arts and Sciences offers degrees especially designed for teaching in elementary schools, teaching of music, performance of music, creation of art works, work in physical education, and social work. The appropriate degrees are described earlier, beginning on page 48. In addition, students can prepare for teaching in secondary schools under a variety of majors for Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. The Diaconal Education and Formation Process, the pre-legal program, and the pre-medical arts programs are professional preparatory programs a student may complete while pursuing a liberal arts major. Students interested in any of these programs should declare the program before entering the sophomore year. Those pursuing an Associate in Science degree may elect the cytotechnology certification option. This program requires the student to complete a one year program in an accredited school of cytotechnology and a one year prescribed course of study at Valparaiso University. The credits from the cytotechnology program (usually 30) will transfer to Valparaiso University to meet about half of the requirements for the A.S. degree. See page 50 for the degree requirements for the Associate in Science degree. Students should contact a pre-medical arts advisor for specific science courses that must be completed. Teacher Education Programs The Teacher Education Program is under the direction of the Department of Education. Eligibility for admission to the program is determined by the department. The University currently prepares applicants for licensure in the following licensure categories listed under types of school and developmental settings. License: Elementary Teaching Elementary: Grades K-6 Additional content areas in any subject areas listed under Secondary Teaching License: Secondary Teaching Grades 5-12 Content Areas: English/Language Arts World Languages-Chinese, French, German, Latin, Spanish Mathematics Science-Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Chemistry, Physics, Earth/Space Sciences Social Studies History P-12 License Art Education Exceptional Needs- Mild Intervention Health Education Music Education Physical Education World Languages-Chinese, French, German, Latin, Spanish Preparation for the Medical Arts Students can prepare for entrance into medical, dental, veterinary, medical technology, physical therapy, or paramedical schools by entering one of the pre-medical arts programs of the college. Students in these programs must have their schedules approved at the beginning of each semester by a major advisor and an assigned pre-medical arts academic advisor. Advising in the pre-medical arts is handled by pre-medical advisors, who are members of the Committee on Pre-Medical Arts. All recommendations to the professional schools are sent out by this Committee: Professor Nelson (Psychology); Associate Professors Goyne (Chemistry), K. Jantzi (Chemistry), Scaglione-Sewell (Biology), Schoer (chair, Chemistry), Scupham (Biology); Assistant Professor R. Clark (Chemistry). Pre-medical and pre-dental students are invited to join the Premedical Society, a student organization that promotes interest in medicine and dentistry through a program of guest lectures and social events. Those with outstanding academic records may be invited to join Alpha Epsilon Delta, a national medical honorary society. In some fields such as medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine, completion of a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree is often required before admission to a professional school. However, if three years or less of college work are needed for entrance into a professional program, a student may earn a bachelor’s degree through the University’s Combined Liberal Arts-Medical Arts program. This involves three years of work at Valparaiso University and one year of work at an approved professional school. Details are in the next section of this catalog.

Brodzinski, Ph.D. Assistant Dean Toni M. Spaliaras, MBA Professors Boyt, Brodzinski, Gingerich, Jin, Ozgur, Pinar; Associate Professors S. Jha, Kumar, Lewis, Liu, Luth, Stück, Trapp, Wilder; Assistant Professors J. Chen, Karaatli, Trendowski; Instructor L. Chen; Lecturers Guydan, Y. Jha, Steele, Ward. The College of Business offers a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with majors in accounting, business analytics, finance, supply chain and logistics management, international business, management, and marketing. In addition, the college offers several graduate programs including a Master’s in Business Administration (see the Valparaiso University Graduate Catalog for details and descriptions). Accreditation The college’s degree programs are fully accredited by AACSB International. AACSB is recognized by the Commission on Recognition of Post-Secondary Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency for degree programs in business administration and accounting. Mission The mission of the College of Business is to cultivate values-based leaders in a dynamic and global environment. The general education curriculum exposes each student to a broad range of disciplines, problem solving techniques, and methods of inquiry. The business curriculum introduces students to concepts, tools of analysis, and techniques of evaluation which further develop skills in problem solving and decision making. These serve as a foundation for their growth into competent and ethically responsible business persons prepared for work in the global environment. The undergraduate education in business is concerned not only with preparation for business careers but with preparation for life in general. As the shared values indicate, “We view students as whole persons and strive to prepare them for personal, as well as professional success.” The Major Field The business core provides background in the production and marketing of goods and/or services and the financing of the business enterprise; it builds on the knowledge gained in the general education component. The student becomes familiar with accounting and quantitative methods that have application to the solution of business problems. Attention is given to ethical and social issues that confront modern business organizations within an integrative, capstone, policy-determination course. In addition to taking certain prescribed courses in the core, the student must complete the requirements for the major in accounting, business analytics, finance, international business, management, or marketing for the degree in business administration. The requirements for each major are set forth in the curricula described beginning on page 295. The undergraduate degree requires that the students devote at least one-half of their time to required and elective courses outside the College of Business. Minor in Business Administration The College offers this minor for non-business students who desire a more advanced preparation in business than is provided by the Fundamentals of Business Minor. For more information and the requirements of these two minors, see page 370 for the Minor in Business Administration and page 371 for the Fundamentals of Business Minor. Minor in *Business Analytics* The college offers this minor to all Valparaiso University students who want to enhance their skills through the effective use of data. For more information and the requirements of this minor, see page 370. Minor in Entrepreneurship The college offers this minor to all Valparaiso University students who want to acquire an understanding of the venture creation process including how to generate and develop a new business concept, apply quantitative and qualitative methods and analytical tools to identify and evaluate entrepreneurial opportunities, use data and analysis to create and evaluate a business plan, and evaluate different funding sources for a new venture. For more information and requirements of this minor, see page 298.  College of Business 290 Minor in Supply Chain & Logistics Management The college offers this minor to all Valparaiso University students who want to acquire an understanding every element of an organization, including purchasing, planning, transportation, production, storage, and all the threads that connect all the different elements of business. A supply chain manager is someone who impacts the overall success of a business to ensure the organization can control their expenses, increase their sales, and effectively maximize profits. For more information and requirements of this minor, see page 299. Credit by Examination Credit through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) can be earned for the following courses:  For "
MKT 304," with the subject examination Principles of Marketing. Minors/Certificates for Business Students In addition to minors in programs outside the College of Business, business students may complete the requirements for an interdisciplinary minor in International Business and Global Studies (available to business students only, see page 298), *Business Analytics* (see page 370), or in Supply Chain and Logisitcs Management (see page 300). In addition, business students may pursue one of the two minors in the Reserve Officer Training Core – Military Leadership: Air Force Minor or Military Leadership: Army Minor (see page 385). Business students may also pursue the Certificate in Business Spanish to communicate to employers their ability to converse with Hispanic customers, employees, and/or managers; see page 300 for a description and requirements for this certificate. A business student may declare a minor in the College of Arts and Sciences. No more than two courses of specified non-business courses required for a College of Business degree may be used in fulfilling the requirements of a minor except for interdisciplinary minors, the minor in mathematics, and the minor in computer science where three courses may be used to simultaneously satisfy the requirements of the major and the minor. Students must earn a 2.250 grade point average in a minor for it to be noted on the student’s official academic record. Honors College The College of Business encourages those students who are qualified to participate in the Christ College Honors program. Business students enrolled in Christ College also have an advisor in Christ College. A College of Business student in Christ College may graduate as a Christ College Scholar (see page 286). Double Major in the College of Business Students may earn a double major by completing all the requirements for two majors. No course used to fulfill the requirements for one major (including major field requirements) may be used to fulfill requirements for a second major, unless the course is required for both majors or the course fulfills the international business requirement for each major. There cannot, however, be any more than a seven credit overlap between the two majors. Double Degree Students may earn double degrees by earning 30 credits and 60 quality points in excess of the total number of semester credits required for the first degree and, in addition, must fulfill all the specific course requirements for the second degree. None of the additional 30 credits for the second degree may be used to fulfill requirements for the first degree. Enhanced International Business in German (EIB-German) EIB-German is a nine-semester program that combines a major in International Business, a major in German, and one academic year of study and work in Germany. The program allows students to gain linguistic and cultural proficiency in the German language and prepares them for careers with German or US companies that operate globally. Students fulfill all requirements for both majors; participate in VU's study abroad program in Reutlingen, Germany, in the seventh semester; enroll in at least two German-language business courses while in Reutlingen; work in a cooperative-education placement in Germany during the eighth semester and ensuing summer; return to campus for the capstone ninth semester; and reside in the Kade-Duesenberg German House and Cultural Center for at least two semesters. EIB–German is coordinated jointly by the College of Business and the German section of the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. Students who wish to enroll in EIB-German should see their business advisor and a German instructor as early as possible.   College of Business 291 Assessment Center The CoB Assessment Center is not a place, but an event. It evaluates each student in the major soft skills of business management. Students are assessed on their problem solving, communication, leadership, teamwork, and interpersonal skills.

Johnson, Ph.D. Mission The College of Engineering prepares and inspires talented students in a strong undergraduate environment to become servant leaders who apply scientific knowledge to benefit society. The College of Engineering accomplishes this mission by: • offering rigorous curricula with a balance of theoretical and practical experience. • promoting professional growth through leadership, scholarship, and work experiences. • encouraging personal growth through service and outreach opportunities. • fostering a learning environment that is technologically rich and culturally diverse. • providing guidance from dedicated faculty mentors. Vision The College of Engineering will be the premier engineering college emphasizing undergraduate education, acknowledged for the impact its students, faculty, staff, and graduates have in leading and serving society.   College of Engineering 316 Core Values (E5) Exploration We encourage creativity inside and outside the classroom. We provide opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to stretch the boundaries of their knowledge and explore uncommon solutions. We help students, faculty, and staff develop the skills necessary for discovery. Excellence We strive for excellence in every activity. We cultivate an environment that fosters learning and critical thinking. We expect faculty, students, and staff to work each day to seek continuous improvement. Ethics We are committed to a culture of honesty, respect, and fairness. We act in a professional and ethical manner in all that we do and say. Equality We strive to create an environment that appreciates and values diversity, in all respects, without judgment. Enjoyment We believe that potential cannot be achieved without enjoyment. We foster an environment where faculty, staff, and students enjoy their work and surroundings. Objectives Engineering is the art of applying scientific and practical knowledge to the solution of problems for the benefit of society. The curriculum integrates scientific and engineering principles, practical laboratory and computer experiences, engineering design experiences culminating in a major design project, and liberal learning in the tradition of Christian church-related colleges and universities. Special emphasis is given to communication skills, the humanities, and the social sciences. Students are enriched by participation in the academic, social, cultural, and spiritual life that is central to the Christian academic tradition at Valparaiso University. Graduates are prepared both for direct entry into the practice of engineering and for graduate school. The Academic Programs Bachelor of Science degrees may be earned in Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The goals of these programs are to build a strong foundation in mathematics, the natural and engineering sciences, and to provide an introduction to engineering design during the early portion of these programs. This is followed by courses with increased emphasis on engineering applications, design, teamwork, and interdisciplinary activity. Instruction in engineering design is integrated throughout the curriculum so that students advance toward higher levels of competence culminating in a senior design project which emphasizes formulation of problem statements and criteria, consideration of alternatives, and communication of results. The laboratory program provides for firsthand observation of physical phenomena, experience in *data collection* and analysis, verification of designs, written and oral communication, and teamwork. The use of computers in both the classroom and laboratory is fully integrated into the curriculum starting in the first semester. History Civil engineering topics were taught at Valparaiso University beginning in 1859. Sisters Ethel and Merle McCall were the first women engineering graduates each receiving civil engineering degrees in 1915. Full four-year programs were established in 1920, with offerings in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. During World War II, with the shortage of male students, the program was temporarily reduced to two years at Valparaiso University followed by two years at Purdue University. After the war, four-year engineering programs were reinstated on campus through the initiative of students who raised funds and then designed and built a new engineering laboratory building. The first post- World War II degrees were offered in 1951 in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering and have been accredited since 1958. The Indiana Delta Chapter of Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society, was chartered in 1963. In 1968, the College of Engineering moved to the newly-constructed Gellersen Engineering and Mathematics Center. This facility was provided through the generosity of the late William A. Gellersen of Oakland, California. The building, located on the southeastern edge of campus, contains faculty offices, classrooms, and laboratories for the College of Engineering, the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the Department of Computer and Information Sciences. The optional cooperative education program was initiated in 1983 and the first group of cooperative education students graduated in 1986. In 2003, the Computer Engineering program was accredited. The college added a fifth program, Bioengineering, in the fall of 2017. Accreditation for this program will occur after the first graduating class.   College of Engineering 317 With the beginning of the 2011-2012 academic year, the Donald V. Fites Engineering Innovation Center, a new state-of-the-art facility, was made available to College of Engineering students. It honors one of Valparaiso University’s most prolific graduates for his contributions as CEO and Chairman of the Board for Caterpillar Incorporated. The Fites Center is an approximately 14,000 square foot high-performance building, which houses innovative laboratory, design, and meeting spaces that foster faculty-student interactions. In 2013, it was awarded LEED® Platinum established by the U.S. Green Building Council and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute. LEED (Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design) is the nation’s preeminent program for the design, construction, and operation of high-performance green buildings. The James S. Markiewicz Manufacturing and Projects Center forms a physical link between the Gellersen Engineering and Mathematics Center to the north, and the Fites Center to the south. The Markiewicz Manufacturing and Projects Center includes the Projects Laboratory and the James S. Markiewicz Manufacturing Suite. The James S. Markiewicz Solar Energy Research Facility became operational during the 2013-14 academic year. This facility provides engineering students with extraordinary laboratory and research experiences involving concentrated solar energy to create commodities and fuels. Both the Manufacturing Projects Center and the Solar Energy Research Facility are named after James S. Markiewicz, '72 ME, whose generosity made these spaces possible. College Organization Administratively, the college is an instructional unit under the direction of the dean. The five programs, Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, are directed by the faculty of the three engineering departments under the leadership of department chairs. Accreditation Bachelor of Science degree programs in Civil Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc. www.abet.org. Bioengineering will apply for accreditation after the first graduating class of students. Admission Requirements The requirements for admission of first-year students to the college are listed on page 398 of this catalog. Students who do not meet the mathematics and science requirements for admission to the College of Engineering may be admitted to the Pre-Engineering Program in the College of Arts and Sciences as described on page 62.

The University encourages cooperation among the various branches of learning and is pleased to announce these programs which are designed to enhance the student’s major area of study. Interdisciplinary Minors The interdisciplinary minors in this section may be presented in partial fulfillment of the Major Field Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts degree (see page 52). Restrictions for Interdisciplinary Minors No more than two courses for these minors may overlap with other requirements whether within general education or within courses in any majors or other minors. This restriction does not apply to majors or minors in the College of Engineering and the College of Business. Interdisciplinary Majors The interdisciplinary majors offered in the College of Arts and Sciences lead to the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degree. These include Actuarial Science (page 70), American Studies (page 72), Chinese and Japanese Studies (page 179), *Data Science* (page 109), Environmental Science (page 138), International Economics and Cultural Affairs (page 183), Global Service (page 184), and Theology and Ministry (page 282). Restrictions for Interdisciplinary Majors A student may combine an additional major or minor with an interdisciplinary major. If there are overlapping courses, the following restrictions apply. An additional major requires at least four courses of at least three credits each beyond those courses in the interdisciplinary major. An additional minor requires at least two courses of at least three credits each beyond those courses in the interdisciplinary major. An administrative committee for an interdisciplinary major or minor may set further restrictions for their major or minor if desired. Business Programs The following interdisciplinary programs are administered by the College of Business. Aviation Minor The minor consists of 22 credits and leads to two FAA certifications and one rating. Note that in order to complete this minor, the student must pass all two FAA certifications and one FAA rating. The Aviation minor may also be completed by students in other colleges but will not count toward fulfilling minor requirements within that student’s college. However, the minor will appear on the transcript of all students. The flight courses for this program are offered on site at the Porter County Regional Airport through a partnership with Eagle Aircraft, a SEVIS-approved flight school. Required Courses 22 Cr. "
