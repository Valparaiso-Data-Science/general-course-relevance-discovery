The club sports are a group of independent clubs under the guidance of the associate athletic director, Bonnie May. Dues, fundraiser, SGA activities, and fee allocations support them. Open to Smith students of any ability level, club sports provide a resource to learn a new sport or practice a familiar one. Presently, there are 13 clubs: Equestrian, Archery, Badminton, Cycling, Fencing, Futsal, Ice Hockey, Quidditch, Rugby, Spirit Squad, Squash, Synchronized Swimming and Ultimate Frisbee.The Campus and Campus Life 21Smith OutdoorsSmith Outdoors is the outdoor adventure program offered through Smith’s ath-letics department. Based out of the Paradise Pond boathouse, Smith Outdoors offers a variety of clinics, presentations and off-campus trips throughout the year. The focus is on providing an outdoor setting for recreation, socializa-tion, self-empowerment and education. Activities vary from foliage hikes and ice-skating to more adventurous trips like rock climbing, backpacking and whitewater rafting. Also included are open hours for recreational paddling on Paradise Pond and rock climbing at the indoor climbing wall located in Ain-sworth Gym. For more information, send email to smithoutdoors@smith.edu or visit www. smith.edu/athletics/clubsports/smithoutdoors.html.Career DevelopmentThe Lazarus Center for Career Development provides and prepares students for careers in a changing economic and technical climate. Staff work with Smith women to help them develop the skills, knowledge, and global and personal foresights needed to navigate their professional careers, even when economic and personal circumstances change. The professional staff offers advising, both individually and in groups; and services are available throughout the academic year and summer months. The center sponsors seminars, workshops and industry discussions that cover internships; non-Fulbright fellowships; career field exploration; résumé writing; effective interviewing and job search strategies; networking; and applying to graduate, medical, dental, and professional schools. They help students assess their individual interests, strengths and weaknesses; establish priorities and make decisions; and present themselves and their backgrounds effectively. The extensive career resource library and website support students in their research and exploration.Praxis Summer Internship Funding Program“Praxis: The Liberal Arts at Work,” administered through the Lazarus Center for Career Development, funds students to work at substantive, unpaid sum-mer internships related to their academic and/or career interests. By offering financial support, the college acknowledges the importance of internships in helping students explore careers, observe the practical applications of their academic studies and gain work experience that enhances their marketability to employers and graduate schools. Since the majority of internships are unpaid, Praxis stipends are intended to make it financially possible for students to work at substantive summer internships. Praxis funding is a one-time opportunity of up to $4,000. A student may use a Praxis stipend for an approved internship in the summer following her sophomore or junior year. Lazarus Center staff and resources offer guidance and assistance to students in locating opportunities that meet their individual interests. Each year approximately 400 students work at summer internships funded through Praxis.Health Serviceswww.smith.edu/healthHealth Services provides medical and psychological services for all Smith stu-dents. Through outpatient services located in the Nancy and Henry Schacht Center for Health and Wellness, students see physicians, nurse practitioners and nurses for medical problems and questions, just as they would see their own providers at home. For psychological issues, students see social workers  and graduate social work interns. A psychiatrist is also available. Health education is provided on topics relevant to students’ emotional and physical health and safety.Medical ServicesThe same standards of confidentiality apply to the doctor-patient relationship at Smith as to all other medical practitioners. Medical Services offers a full array of exams and testing; nutrition counseling; routine physicals for summer em-ployment and graduate school; immunizations for travel, flu and allergies; and on-site laboratory services.  In case of unusual or serious illness, specialists in the Northampton and Springfield areas are available for consultation in addition to service provided at a nearby hospital.Counseling ServiceThe Counseling Service provides consultation, individual and group psychother-apy and psychiatric evaluation and medication. These services are strictly con-fidential. The Counseling Service is available to all students, free of charge. It is staffed by licensed mental health professionals and supervised graduate interns.Health EducationThe wellness education program integrates innovative wellness initiatives into students’ academic, residential and extracurricular activities. The program provides opportunities for students to take leadership roles in health education on campus.College Health InsuranceThe college offers its own insurance policy, underwritten by an insurance com-pany, that covers a student in the special circumstances of a residential college. It extends coverage for in- and outpatient services not covered by many other insurance plans. However, this policy does have some distinct limitations. There-fore, we strongly urge that students consider continuing their precollege health insurance. Failure to waive the college health plan will result in automatic enrollment in it. The college maintains certain regulations in the interest of community health as outlined in the college handbook and expects all students to comply. Before arriving at the college, each student must complete her Health Pre-Admission Information Form and send it to the Health Services. It is important to note that Massachusetts law now mandates that students must get the re-quired immunizations before registration. Students accepted for a Study Abroad Program or who plan to participate in intercollegiate sports or certain exercise and sport programs may be required to have a physical exam by a college practitioner first.Religious ExpressionThe college encourages student spiritual development and many expressions of religious faith on campus. The Center of Religious and Spiritual Life (CRSL) is housed in the Helen Hills Hills Chapel. The director of the center is responsible for overseeing the program, advising student religious organizations and pro-moting a spirit of mutual understanding, respect, and interfaith collaboration.     The college has relationships with local religious liaisons who serve as advis-ers to student religious organizations and provide opportunities for students to engage with the larger Northampton community. An interfaith advisory group of students meet weekly to discuss the spiritual needs of students, plan joint activi-ties and foster dialogue. The center prioritizes contemplative practice, religious literacy, social justice and spiritual care, and also provides regular hospitality programming through its kitchen and lounge, offering meals and spaces for gathering in times of stress or need. The CSRL strives to meet the special needs of all students not just those who affiliate with an organized religious path. Cen-ter staff work with local clergy and faith leaders who help nurture the spiritual 22 The Campus and Campus Lifelives of students and provide opportunities to worship and observe. All students are welcome regardless of belief system or religious affiliation. Information about events can be found at www.smith.edu/religiouslife.     The Helen Hills Hills Chapel is home to a robust arts program as well. The Center for Religious and Spiritual Life sponsors concerts, lectures, films and ex-hibits by student and faculty musicians, and visiting artists. The college organist directs Handbell Choir rehearsals in the chapel and uses the Aolian-Skinner organ for teaching and performances. The CRSL collaborates with dining to respect dietary needs relating to religious observance. Kosher and halal meals are available to students in the Cutter-Ziskind dining room during the week. In addition, students prepare and host a kosher Shabbat meal and community gathering each Friday evening. A Jummah lunch is offered at noon every Friday for the Muslim community with the location rotating between the Helen Hills Hills Chapel and the prayer area in the basement of Wright Hall. Religious holidays such as Christmas, Ramadan, Passover, and Diwali are observed in collaboration with student and community groups.     College policy states that any student who is unable because of religious observance to attend classes, participate in an examination, study, or work on a particular day will be excused from such activities without prejudice and will be given an opportunity to make them up, provided such make-up work does not create an unreasonable burden on the college. No fees will be charged for rescheduling an examination. It is each student’s responsibility to request an excused absence from a faculty member well in advance of a religious holiday. In certain instances the CRSL will consult with students, faculty and staff when a religious consideration is in question. Students can also speak with the direc-tor of religious life/college chaplain when a religious consideration is raised with respect to housing needs.The Student Body 23The Student BodySummary of EnrollmentUndergraduate Students          Ada Comstock Class of 2018 Class of 2019 Class of 2020 Class of 2021 Scholars TotalsNorthampton area* 607 477 654 650 71 2,459Not in residence 27 146 12 0 2 187Five College course enrollments at Smith:  First semester  380 Second semester  450Graduate Students Full-time Part-time degree candidates degree candidates Special studentsIn residence 65 12 0Smith Students Studying in Off-campus Programs Florence Geneva Hamburg ParisSmith students 11 5 5 20Guest students 0 1 0 0*Guest students are included in the above counts.In accordance with the Student Right-To-Know and Campus Security Act, the graduation rate for students who entered Smith College as first-year students in Sep-tember 2011 was 88 percent by May 2017.

Each year approximately 25 percent of the graduating class is awarded the bachelor of arts degree with Latin Honors and/or departmental honors.Latin HonorsLatin Honors are awarded to eligible graduating seniors on the basis of the cumulative grade point average for a minimum of 48 graded credits earned during the sophomore, junior and senior years. Only grades from Smith College courses and courses taken on the Five College Interchange are counted; Smith Study Abroad grades are considered Smith grades. No grades from exchange programs in this country or abroad are counted. Pluses and minuses are taken into account; grades of P/F (Pass or Fail) or S/U (Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory) do not enter into the calculations.     If a student spends one of her sophomore through senior years away from Smith (with the exception of the Smith Programs Abroad), the grades from the remaining two years will be used. Grades from the first year are never counted. The minimum grade point average for Latin Honors varies each year depending on the overall grade distribution in the senior class and is not published. The degree may be awarded cum laude, magna cum laude or summa cum laude on the basis of meeting eligibility requirements and of a very high level of aca-demic achievement.    Students who wish to become eligible for Latin Honors at graduation mustelect at least one course (normally four credits) in each of the seven major fieldsof knowledge (literature, historical studies, social science, natural science, mathematics and analytical philosophy, the arts, and foreign language). Course listings in this catalog indicate in curly brackets which area(s) of knowledge a given course covers.     Please note that one year of an introductory language course or one course at a higher level satisfies the foreign language Latin Honors requirement. Students who are non-native speakers of English may, with the permission of a class dean, offer any two courses in the English department at the 100 level (or one course at a higher level in the English department, the comparative litera-ture program or in classics in translation) to satisfy the “foreign language” part of the Latin Honors requirement. The class dean will notify the registrar that such an arrangement has been approved. Any appeals should be sent to the dean of the faculty. Nonnative speakers of English are considered to be those who indicated on their advising form that English was not their first language, have had several years of education in a school where the language of instruction was other than English, and can read, write and speak this language. Eligibility for Latin Honors may be affected by the decisions of the Honor Board.Departmental HonorsA departmental honors program allows a student with a strong academic back-ground to do independent and original work in her major. The program pro-vides recognition for students who do work of high quality in the preparation of a thesis and in courses and seminars. Departmental honors students must also fulfill all college and departmental requirements.     Successful completion of work in the honors program (an honors thesis and at least one honors examination) leads to the awarding of the bachelor of arts degree with the added notation “Honors,” “High Honors” or “Highest Honors” in the student’s major subject.The Dean’s ListThe Dean’s List is made up of students who represent the top 25 percent of the student body based on the total records for the previous academic year. Students must be enrolled full-time at Smith for the full year to be named to the Dean’s List.Phi Beta KappaPhi Beta Kappa is the oldest and most widely recognized undergraduate honor society in the United States. The Greek initials stand for the society’s motto “Love of learning is the guide of life.” Since 1776, the mission of the society has been to foster and recognize excellence in the liberal arts and sciences. The Zeta of Massachusetts Chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa Society was established at Smith College in 1905. The rules of eligibility are set by the chapter in accordance with the national society; election is made on the breadth and excellence of overall academic achievement.     To be eligible for election, a student must have satisfied the Latin Honors distribution requirements and completed 58 graded credits of Smith course work, not counting the first year. Study abroad programs count for Smith credit only if they are Smith programs. Courses taken in the Five College consortium count as Smith credits. All other courses including those taken S/U may count for distribution requirements, but not as credits in the calculation of the GPA nor as part of the total credit requirement. Elections are held twice a year. In late fall of their senior year, “junior” Phi Beta Kappa members are elected on the basis of their academic records through the junior year. At the end of the spring semester, more seniors are elected based on their complete academic record. For questions about election criteria, students and faculty are urged to consult with the president or secretary of the chapter. More information about the Phi Beta Kappa Society, its history, publica-tions and activities can be found at www.pbk.org.Society of the Sigma XiIn 1935 Smith College became the first women’s college to be granted a charter for the establishment of a chapter of the Society of the Sigma Xi. Each year the Smith College Chapter elects to membership promising graduate students and seniors who excel in science.Recognition for Academic AchievementRecognition for Academic Achievement 27The following prizes are awarded at the Awards Convocation on Ivy Day.The Chinua Achebe Prize in Comparative Lit-erature to a graduating senior with the highest GPA in courses that count toward the comparative literature majorThe Margaret Collins Stoop Adesso Prize for the best new choral work composed by a Smith studentThe Anne Bradstreet Prize from the Academy of American Poets for the best poem or group of poems submitted by an undergraduateAn award from the Connecticut Valley Section of the American Chemical Society to a student who has done outstanding work in chemistry, biochem-istry or chemical engineeringThe American Chemical Society Analytical Chem-istry Award to a junior chemistry major who has excelled in analytical chemistryThe American Chemical Society Award in Inorganic Chemistry to a chemistry major for excellence in inorganic chemistry and to encourage further study in the fieldThe American Chemical Society/Division of Or-ganic Chemistry Award in Organic ChemistryThe American Chemical Society/Polymer Ed-ucation Division Organic Chemistry Award for Achievement in Organic Chemistry to a student majoring in chemistry who has done outstanding work in the organic chemistry sequenceThe American Chemical Society Undergradu-ate Award in Physical Chemistry for outstanding achievement by an undergraduate student in physi-cal chemistry, and to encourage further pursuits in the fieldAn award from The American Institute of Chem-ists/New England Division to an outstanding chemist or chemical engineer in the graduating classThe Newton Arvin Prize in American Studies for the best long paper in the introductory course on the study of American Society and CultureThe Anita Luria Ascher Memorial Prize to asenior nonmajor who started German at Smith and has made exceptional progress, to a senior major who started German at Smith and has made ex-ceptional progress and to a senior who knew some German when she came to Smith and has made exceptional progressThe Astronomy Department Prize for Excellence in Astronomy and Astrophysics for honors theses, special studies projects, outreach or other educa-tional projects, STRIDE/AEMES projects, especially if they lead to continued involvement in the depart-ment, or exceptional performance in classes without any of the aboveThe Award for Excellence in Dance Studies for outstanding work in senior capstone project and overall contributions to the departmentThe Elizabeth Babcock Poetry Prize for the best group of poemsThe Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey Prize for innovative and collaborative approaches to solving environmental and sustainability problemsThe Sidney Balman Prize for outstanding work in the Jewish Studies ProgramThe Harriet Dey Barnum Memorial Prize for outstanding work in music to the best all-around student of music in the senior classThe Gladys Lampert ’28 and Edward Beenstock Prize for the best honors thesis in American studies or American historyThe Suzan Rose Benedict Prize to a sophomore for excellence in mathematicsThe Samuel Bowles Prize for the best paper on an anthropological subjectThe Samuel Bowles Prize for the best paper in economicsThe Samuel Bowles Prize for the best paper on a sociological subjectThe Kathleen Bostwick Boyden Prize awarded to a member of the Service Organizations of Smith who has demonstrated the best initiative in her volunteer contributions to the Smith College communityThe John Everett Brady Prize for excellence in the translation of Latin at sight; and for the best perfor-mance in the beginning Latin courseThe Margaret Wemple Brigham Prize to a senior for excellence in the study of microbiology or im-munologyThe Amey Randall Brown Prize awarded for the best essay on a botanical subjectThe Vera Lee Brown Prize for excellence in history to a senior majoring in history in regular courseThe Yvonne Sarah Bernhardt Buerger Prize to the students who have made the most notable con-tribution to the dramatic activities of the collegeThe David C.

It is also a financial chal-lenge for many families. At Smith, we encourage all qualified students to apply for admission, regardless of family financial resources. Our students come from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. The Office of Student Financial Ser-vices has an experienced staff to assist students and parents in both the individ-ual financial aid application process and the educational financing process in general. We work with families to help them manage the financial challenge in a variety of ways, through financial aid, loans and payment plan options. Many Smith students receive financial assistance to pay for college expenses. Smith College participates in all the major federal and state student aid pro-grams while funding a substantial institutional grant and scholarship program from its endowment. We realize that financing a college education is a complex process, and we encourage applicants and their families to communicate directly with us. Our experienced educational financing staff in the Office of Student Financial Ser-vices is available to work with you. Inquiries may be made by calling 413-585-2530 between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. weekdays; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Wednesdays (Eastern time). Send email to SFS@smith.edu or visit their website at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.Your Student AccountSmith College considers the student to be responsible for ensuring that pay-ments—whether from loans, grants, parents, or other third parties—are received in a timely manner. All student accounts are managed by the Office of Student Financial Services. Initial statements detailing semester fees are avail-able online on or about July 15 and December 15. Email notifications will be sent to all students on or about the 15th of each month in which there is activity on the account. Students who wish to designate a parent or other third party to be notified of bills and to have the ability to make payments on their student account must set the designee up as an “authorized user” through their online account. Important: no paper bills are mailed. The college’s comprehensive fees associated with the beginning of the se-mester are due and payable in full by specific deadline dates, well in advance of the beginning of classes. The payment deadline for fall is August 10. For spring, the payment deadline is January 10. Payment must be received by these dates to avoid late payment fees being assessed. Checks should be made payable to Smith College and include the student’s name and ID number on the front.     After any payment is due, monthly late payment fees, which are based on the outstanding balance remaining after any payment due date, will be assessed at the rate of $1.25 on every $100 (1.25 percent) that remains unpaid until the payment is received in full, on or before the next billing month in which the student is invoiced. If you have questions regarding any charges or credits on your bill, contact the Office of Student Financial Services.     In cases where students default on financial obligations, the student is re-sponsible for paying the outstanding balance including all late payment fees, collection costs and any legal fees incurred by the college during the collection process. Transcripts and other academic records will not be released until all financial obligations to the college have been met.     IMPORTANT NOTE: Payments for each month’s bill must be received by the Office of Student Financial Services by the payment due date. If paying by mail, please allow at least five to seven business days for mail and processing time. If paying in person, payment should be made before 4 p.m. on the payment due date. Electronic ACH payments made through our online billing service are credited immediately. The college expects the student to fulfill her financial responsibility and reserves the right to place limitations on the student for failure to do so. The consequences of nonpayment include possible loss of housing assignment, and prevention of: a) registration for future semester courses, b) receipt of academic transcripts, c) receipt of diploma at commencement, d) approval for a leave of absence or study-abroad program, and e) participation in leadership training opportunities. The college also reserves the right to have the student admin-istratively withdrawn and may refer such account for collection in her name. Students and parents are welcome to contact the Office of Student Financial Services for assistance in meeting payment responsibilities.     Most credit balance refunds are issued on request, by direct deposit into the account the student has on file with the payroll office. Credit balances that result from a PLUS loan are generally issued to the parent borrower, unless that parent has authorized that refunds go to the student. With the student’s written release, credit balance refunds may be issued to the parent or the designee of the student.Fees2018–19 Comprehensive Fee (required institutional fees)  Fall Semester Spring Semester TotalTuition $26,060 $26,060 $52,120Room and Board* 8,760 8,760 17,520Student activities fee 142 142 284_________________________________________________Comprehensive fee $34,962 $34,962 $69,924* Room and board will be billed as a combined charge.As part of her expenses, a student should be prepared to spend a minimum of $800 per year on books and academic supplies.

The Student Government As-sociation allocates the monies each year. Each spring, the Senate Finance Com-mittee of the SGA proposes a budget that is voted on by the student body.Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid32 Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid2018–19 Optional FeesStudent Medical Insurance–$2,368The $2,368 Student Medical Insurance fee is split between the two semesters and covers the student from August 15 through the following August 14. January grad-uates are covered only through January 14 in their senior year. Massachusetts law requires that each student have comprehensive health insurance; Smith College offers a medical insurance plan through Gallagher Koster Insurance (www.galla-gherstudent.com) for those students not otherwise insured. Details about the insur-ance are mailed during the summer. Students are automatically billed for this insurance unless they follow the waiver process outlined in the insurance mailing. Students must waive the insurance coverage by August 10 in order to avoid pur-chasing the annual Smith Plan. If a student is on leave on a Smith-approved pro-gram that is billed at home-school fees, a reduced charge may apply. For students who are admitted for spring semester, the charge will be $1,375  for 2018–19.Other Fees and ChargesEnrollment Deposit–$500Upon admittance, a new student pays an enrollment deposit which serves to reserve her place in the class and a room if she will reside in campus housing. The $300 representing a general deposit component is held until six months after the student graduates from the college. The $300 is refunded only after de-ducting any unpaid fees or fines and is not refunded to a student who withdraws (including an admitted student who does not attend). The $200 representing a room deposit component is credited $100 in July toward fall semester charges and $100 in December toward spring semester charges. For midyear transfer students, all $200 is credited toward spring semester charges.Fee for Musical Instruction–$690 per semester (one-hour lesson per week)Music fees are covered by the college for all declared minors and majors. Students who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant).     Practice rooms are available to Smith College students with first preference given to those registered for music instruction. Other Five College students may apply to the chair of the music department for permission to use the facilities. Practice rooms may be available for use by other individuals in last order of preference upon successful application to the chair of the music department.     There is no charge for Five College students, faculty and staff for use of the practice rooms. For other individuals, the following fee will apply. Use of a practice room, one hour daily $25Fee for Riding Classes—per semesterRiding lessons are available to all students at the college. The lessons are held at Soneleigh-Burnham Equestrian Center in Greenfield, Massachusetts (a 20 minute ride from the Smith College campus). Smith College has vans available for students to drive to Greenfield. The Smith riding team uses this facility for practice and horse shows. The fee for each semester is $950. Questions can be directed to the Athletics Department at 585-2706.Studio Art Courses—per semesterCertain materials and supplies are required for studio art courses and will be provided to each student. Students may require additional supplies as well and will be responsible for purchasing them directly. The expenses will vary from course to course and from student to student. Required materials $138 Additional supplies $59Chemistry Laboratory Course—$25 per semesterContinuation Fee—$60 per semesterStudents on leave of absence or attending other institutions on exchange or junior year abroad programs will be assessed a continuation fee to maintain enrollment status at the college.Overdue Balance FeeAny balance outstanding for fall after August 10 or for spring after January 10 is considered overdue. Overdue balances will be assessed a late fee of $1.25 per $100 each month they remain outstanding.Insufficient Funds FeeIf a payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, a charge of $20 will be added to the student account.Incorrect Account Number FeeIf an incorrect or invalid account number is entered into our TouchNet payment system when a payer is attempting to make a payment, a $5 charge will be add-ed to the student account.Early Arrival Fee–$150Late Registration Fee–$35Students who make registration changes after the registration period will be assessed a fee for each change.Bed Removal Fee–$100Students who remove their beds from their campus rooms will be charged a bed removal fee.Health/Fire/Safety Violation–$5 per itemA minimum fine of $5 per item will be charged for items left in public areas such as corridors, stairways or entrances. These items create a hazard and vio-late compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, as well as city and state building, fire and safety codes.Institutional Refund PolicyA refund will be calculated if a student withdraws on or after the first day of classes but before the point when the college is considered to have earned all the tuition, room, board and mandatory fees (hereinafter called institutional charges) for which the student was charged. Credit balances remaining on any account will be refunded to the appropriate person or agency.Adjustment of Institutional Charges and Institutional AidAny student who withdraws prior to the first day of classes will receive a 100 percent adjustment of institutional charges and insurance. All disbursed Title IV aid, institutional aid, state and other aid will be returned to the appropriate account by the college.    A student who withdraws after the first day of classes, but before the time when she will have completed 60 percent of the period of enrollment, will have her institutional charges and institutional aid adjusted based on the percentage of class attendance.     If a student should withdraw from an off-campus program, which is billed by Smith (for example: Study Abroad, Picker and Smithsonian Programs), the normal college refund policies apply as long as all payments can be recovered by the college. If payments made on behalf of the student to other entities can-not be recovered by the college, the student is responsible for unrecoverable costs.Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid 33 Students who withdraw from study-abroad programs that are approved, but not administered by Smith College will have a proration of charges and aid based on the enrollment dates of the program, rather than those of Smith Col-lege. After the 60 percent point of the program term, the student is not entitled to a refund of charges and is also responsible for unrecoverable costs.Students Receiving Title IV Federal AidPer federal regulations, a student earns her aid based on the period of time she remains enrolled. Unearned Title IV funds, other than Federal Work Study, must be returned to the appropriate federal agency. During the first 60 percent of the enrollment period, a student earns Title IV funds in direct proportion to the length of time she remains enrolled. A student who remains enrolled beyond the 60 percent point earns all the aid for the payment period. For example, if the period of enrollment is 100 days and the student completes 25 days, then she has earned 25 percent of her aid. The remainder of the aid must be returned to the appropriate federal agency.Other ChargesIf a student has not waived, or has accepted the medical insurance and with-draws from the college during the first 31 days of the period for which coverage is purchased, and she has not used the insurance, she will not be covered under the plan and a full credit of the premium will be made. Insured students with-drawing at or after 31 days will remain covered under the plan for the full period for which the premium has been paid and no refund will be made available.     Other charges, such as library fines, parking fines and infirmary charges are not adjusted upon the student’s withdrawal. Contractual LimitationsIf Smith College’s performance of its educational objectives, support services or lodging and food services is hampered or restrained on account of strikes, fire, shipping delays, acts of God, prohibition or restraint of governmental authority, or other similar causes beyond Smith College’s control, Smith College shall not be liable to anyone, except to the extent of allowing in such cases a pro-rata reduction in fees or charges already paid to Smith College.Payment Plans and Loan OptionsSmith offers a variety of payment plan and loan options to assist you in success-fully planning for timely payment of your college bill.• Semester Plan• Touch Net Payment PlanSmith also honors parent and student loan options.Details on loan options and the payment plan can be found on the Web at www.smith.edu/about-smith/sfs.Financial AidWe welcome women from all economic backgrounds. No woman should hesitate to apply to Smith because of an inability to pay the entire cost of her education. We meet the full documented financial need of all admitted under-graduates who have met the published admission and financial aid deadlines. Awards are offered to applicants on the basis of need, and calculated according to established college and federal policies. An award is usually a combination of a grant, a loan and a campus job. Smith College is committed to a financial aid policy that guarantees to meet the full financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students who meet published deadlines. The college does operate under a need-sensitive admission policy that typically affects less than 6 percent of our applicant pool. Each applicant for admission is evaluated on the basis of her academic and personal qualities. However, the college may choose to consider a student’s level of financial need when making the final admission decision. Applicants are advised to complete the financial aid process if they will need financial help to attend Smith. Entering first-year students who fail to apply for financial aid by the published deadlines will be ineligible to receive college-funded assistance until they have completed 64 credits earned at Smith. Transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars who do not apply for financial aid by the published dead-lines are eligible to apply after completing 32 credits earned at Smith. Students may apply for federal aid at any point during the academic year. International students (not U.S. citizens or permanent residents) who do not apply for aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid at any time during their tenure at Smith.     To enable the college to determine a student’s need, a family completes both the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the College Scholar-ship Service PROFILE form, requesting that data be sent to Smith. Both forms are completed on-line. The FAFSA can be accessed at www.fafsa.ed.gov (Smith College code is 002209) and the PROFILE can be accessed at www.collegeboard.com (Smith College code is 3762).     Students must also complete the Smith Aid Application, available at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.     We also require a signed copy of the family’s most recent federal tax returns, including all schedules and W-2’s. Other forms and documents may be required, based on each family’s circumstances. Once we receive a completed application, we review each student’s file individually. We take into consideration the number of dependents, the number of family members in college, divorced parents and other special circumstances. For international applicants, the CSS Profile and an official income statement or income tax return are required to determine financial and eligibility.     Smith College recognizes the diversity of the modern family, and requires the submission of information regarding both legal or biological or adoptive parents, as well as spouses and domestic partners of each parent. Exceptions to this policy are made on a case-by-case basis. Please contact the Office of Student Financial Services for more information.     The college makes the final decision on the level of need and awards. Fi-nancial aid decisions to entering students are announced simultaneously with admission notifications. College policy limits the awards of Smith funds to the level of billed fees.   A student who is awarded aid at admission will have it renewed each year she attends according to her need, as calculated by the college, if she is in good academic standing. She and her family apply for aid annually with Smith Col-lege forms, FAFSA and PROFILE forms, and tax returns. The amount of aid may vary from year to year depending on changes in college fees and in the family’s financial circumstances. The balance of loan, work and grant also changes, based on federal loan limits and college policy. Instructions for renewing aid are made available to all students in December. Traditional students (not Ada Com-stock Scholars) are expected to complete their undergraduate studies in eight semesters, and grant aid is limited to that period, except for special programs or in circumstances involving medical withdrawal.     Ada Comstock Scholars receiving financial aid are required to make satis-factory progress toward the degree in order to continue receiving aid—that is, completion of at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic year. Progress is evaluated on a semester basis. Students not meeting this criterion are put on financial aid warning. Students may be required to appeal in writing to continue to receive federal financial aid and may become ineligible for aid if the probationary period exceeds one year.     Unless the administrative board decides that mitigating circumstances warrant an exception, no financial aid will be available to a student who is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree.34 Fees, Expenses and Financial AidFirst-Year Applicants (U.S. Citizens, Permanent Residents, and Undocumented U.S. Residents)Any student who needs or may need help in financing her education should apply for financial aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission. Students must not wait until they have been accepted for admission to apply for aid. Each student’s file is carefully reviewed to determine eligibility for need-based aid. Since this is a detailed process, the college expects students to follow published application guidelines and to meet the appropriate application deadlines. Students and parents are encouraged to contact Student Financial Services via email at sfs@smith.edu or by phone (413-585-2530) with questions. Detailed information on the application process and deadlines is available on our website at www.smith.edu/sfs/portal.     The consequences of not applying for aid prior to being accepted for ad-mission include a 64-credit waiting period before becoming eligible to receive college grant aid. This means that only federal, state and private assistance would be available for the first two years of undergraduate enrollment at Smith. The college will consider exceptions to this policy only if you experience and can document an unexpected family emergency. Please note that this policy does not pertain to students who, prior to admission to Smith, applied for but were not granted need-based financial aid.     If an entering student applied for but did not qualify for need-based aid in her first year, that student may reapply for aid in subsequent years. This is par-ticularly important for families that experience changes in family circumstanc-es such as a sibling entering college, reductions in parent income, divorce or separation, or unanticipated medical expenses. Students who want to apply for federal aid only have a modified application process. If there are major changes to the financial resources of the family, Student Financial Services will consider a new request for aid or a review of a previous denial at any time.     The college cannot assume responsibility for family unwillingness to contribute to college expenses. There are limited circumstances that qualify a student for consideration as an independent aid applicant. Women over the age of 24, orphans and wards of the court are always considered self-supporting for federal financial aid purposes. Students who meet the federal definition of independent status are not automatically considered independent by the college. Please contact SFS to discuss questions regarding this situation.Transfer StudentsTransfer students should follow the application procedures detailed on their specific financial aid applications. Transfer students who do not apply for aid by the published deadlines, prior to admission, cannot apply for college aid until they reach junior standing and complete at least 32 credits at Smith.Ada Comstock ScholarsWomen of nontraditional college age can apply to the Ada Comstock Scholars Program. Applicants for aid should complete a Free Application for Federal Stu-dent Aid (FAFSA), the Ada Comstock Scholars program Application for Financial Aid and send us a signed copy of their most recent federal tax return, complete with all schedules and W-2’s as well as their spouse or partner’s complete tax return and W-2’s.     An Ada Comstock Scholar who does not apply for aid by the published dead-lines, prior to admission, cannot apply for institutional grant aid until she has completed 32 credits at Smith, although she may qualify for federal and state grants and loans before she has completed 32 credits. This policy does not apply to women who applied for, but were not granted, aid at the time of admission.International ApplicantsSmith College awards need-based aid to international non-U.S. citizens, both first-year and transfer applicants. There is a great deal of competition for these funds, and the level of support provided from the college ranges widely, depending on particular family circumstances. Aid is determined based on the information provided by the family on the CSS Profile, along with translated tax or income statements. International students not awarded financial aid prior to admission are not eligible to receive financial aid from the college at any time.     The application deadline is January 25.     Non-U.S. citizens eligible for aid have a family contribution calculated prior to admission. This family contribution will remain the same throughout the student’s tenure at Smith. Any increases in tuition and fees not covered by the annual increased loan or work will be covered by an increase in the grant so that the calculated family contribution will remain the same each year. (Loan and campus job amounts, which are part of the total aid package, increase each year as part of standard college policy. For application deadlines and details, please check www.smith.edu/sfs.)U.S. Citizens Living Outside the U.S.Follow procedures for applicants residing in the United States. If your parents are living and earning income outside the United States and do not file U.S. tax returns, you should submit translated tax or income statements.     U.S. citizens and permanent residents must reapply for aid each year.Policy for Review and Appeal of Need-Based Financial Aid AwardsA student has the right to request a review of her financial aid award. Domestic students must reapply for financial aid each year, and thus are automatically reviewed on an annual basis. International students are given a family contri-bution determination at the time of admission for their entire Smith career and thus are only eligible for a review at the time of admission.Domestic StudentsDomestic students may request a review of their financial aid awards at any time during their Smith careers if there has been a significant change in family circumstances since filing the application for financial aid or if the information on the original application was inaccurate.International StudentsInternational students seeking a financial aid adjustment after they have ac-cepted an offer of admission must consult with Student Financial Services (SFS) to review the situation and discuss available options. The financial aid budget for international students is fully allocated each year as of the time of admis-sion, therefore only very limited additional resources are made available to meet extraordinary circumstances. Serious consideration is only given when there has been a significant life-changing event. A life-changing event would include, but is not limited to, the death of a parent or enrollment of a sibling in a U.S. col-lege or university. If you wish to appeal your financial aid award, please begin by contacting Student Financial Services.ProcessWhen a review is requested it is conducted by the SFS Review Committee. In most cases, their decision is final. When the issue under review would require an exception to policy, a student may request it be reviewed by the Financial Aid Ap-peals Committee. Instructions for submitting an appeal will be provided by the SFS staff to the student if a policy is at issue. All reviews from international stu-dents for increased grant or loan assistance are considered exceptions to policy and will be brought to the attention of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee.     The Financial Aid Appeals Committee is chaired by the dean of enrollment and includes one member of the faculty, the dean of students and a member of the finance office. The director of SFS is a nonvoting member of the Financial Aid Appeals Committee. The student must present her appeal in writing. The committee will consider the appeal as soon as possible. It normally takes one to two weeks for this committee to convene and review the appeal(s) in question. A decision will be given in writing to the student within 48 hours after the appeal is heard. The decision of the Appeals Committee is final in all cases.Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid 35Need-Based Financial Aid AwardsFinancial aid awards are made up of loans, campus jobs and grants. A loan and job, both considered self-help, are usually the first components of an aid pack-age, with any remaining need being met with grant aid.LoansMost students borrow through the Federal Direct Ford Loan Program. Some awards may also include a Smith College loan. Most parents are eligible to bor-row under the Federal Parent Loan Program. Students who receive aid of any sort from federal funds are subject to the statutes governing such aid.Campus JobsStudent Financial Services administers campus jobs. All students may apply, but priority is given to those students (about one-half of our student body) who received campus job offers as part of their aid packages. First-year students may work an average of eight hours a week for 32 weeks. Students in other classes may hold regular jobs averaging ten hours a week for 32 weeks. These monies are paid directly to each student as she earns them. They are intended primarily to cover personal expenses, but some students use part or all of their earnings to-ward required fees. Short-term jobs are open to all students. Additionally, a term-time internship program is administered by the Career Development Office. The college participates in the federally funded Work-Study Program, which funds a portion of the earnings of eligible students, some of them in nonprofit, commu-nity service positions and in the America Reads tutorial program. Smith College also provides a need-based employment program for those students eligible for need-based work, but not eligible for the federally subsidized Federal Work-Study Program.     No student, whether on federal work-study or not, is permitted to work more than the maximum 10-hours a week or one “full-time” position. First-year students may work a maximum of eight hours per week. Students receiving a stipend for such positions as STRIDE or HCA  are not eligible for a second job. This policy attempts to offer all students an equal opportunity to work.GrantsGrants are funds given to students with no requirement of repayment or work time in exchange. Most Smith College grants come from funds given for this purpose by alumnae and friends of the college and by foundations and corpora-tions. Federal and state governments also provide assistance through need-based grants such as the Federal Pell Grant and state scholarships. Smith receives an allocation each year for Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants and for state-funded Gilbert Grants for Massachusetts residents.Outside AidOutside Aid Awarded on the Basis of Student Merit or Parent EmploymentSmith College recognizes your achievement in being awarded merit-based aid. Outside aid based on student merit or parent employment will first reduce or replace the self-help portion of your award (work-study and federal subsidized loan). If the outside aid exceeds the total self-help portion of your award, the aid can go toward a one-time computer purchase or toward the cost of the on-campus health insurance plan. If you do not purchase or have already purchased a computer, and if you do not accept the on-campus health insur-ance plan, or if your merit aid exceeds these costs, outside aid will replace Smith Grant on a dollar-for-dollar basis.     Note: GEARUP scholarships are considered within this category as outside scholarships.     Student Financial Services must be notified of all outside awards. If you notify SFS by June 1, the aid will be reflected in your official award and on your first bill. If you notify SFS after September 1, the outside aid may be used to re-duce Smith Grant dollar for dollar.State and Federal Grant AssistanceThese awards reduce Smith Grant eligibility dollar for dollar. Educational benefits from state and federal agencies will reduce the self-help components of the award (loan and work). Need-based loans from state or outside agencies can be used to replace dollar for dollar either the suggested federal loan or the work study award. Amounts in excess of the self-help award will replace Smith Grant dollar for dollar.Music GrantsStudents who receive need-based aid will receive a $200 grant per semester toward the cost of performance lessons. In addition, all students registered for performance lessons can submit an application to the music department for scholarship aid (for those receiving need-based aid, these funds are in addition to the aforementioned $200 grant). ROTCAir Force ROTC is available at most colleges and universities in western Mas-sachusetts, including Smith College. Air Force ROTC offers two-, three- and four-year enlistment scholarships to qualified new and continuing college students.

Admitting students who will thrive in the Smith environment remains the goal of our ad-mission efforts. We seek students who will be productive members of the Smith community, who will be challenged by all that is offered here and who will chal-lenge their faculty members and peers to sharpen their ideas and perspectives of the world. Each year we enroll a first-year class of approximately 600 able, motivated, diverse students whose records show academic achievement, intellectual curios-ity and potential for growth. Because our students come from 48 states and 73 countries, their educational and personal experiences and opportunities vary tremendously. In selecting a class, the Board of Admission, which is made up of faculty members as well as members of the admission staff, considers each student in the light of the opportunities available to her. Included in the board’s review are her secondary school record, the recommendations from her school, her essay and any other available information.     Smith College meets fully the documented financial need, as calculated by the college, of all admitted students. About 60 percent of our students receive some form of financial assistance through grants, loans and/or campus jobs. Further information about financial planning for a Smith education and about financial aid is available in the section on Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid.Secondary School PreparationThere is no typical applicant to Smith and no typical academic program, but we strongly recommend that a student prepare for Smith by taking the strongest courses offered by her high school. Specifically this should include the follow-ing, at a minimum where possible:• four years of English• three years of a foreign language (or two years in each of two languages)• three years of mathematics• three years of lab science• two years of historyBeyond meeting the normal minimum requirements, we expect each candidate to pursue in greater depth academic interests of special importance to her. Can-didates who are interested in our engineering major should pursue coursework in calculus, biology, chemistry and physics.     Smith College will accept college-level work completed prior to matricula-tion as a degree student, provided that the relevant courses were completed at an accredited college or university and were not applied to the requirements for high school graduation. We also give credit for excellent performance in Ad-vanced Placement, International Baccalaureate and equivalent foreign exam-inations. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for further information regarding eligibility for and use of such credit.Entrance TestsSAT I or ACT scores are optional for U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents. Standardized tests (SAT I, ACT, TOEFL, IELTS or PTE as appropriate) are re-quired for international citizens. SAT II subject tests are not required for any ap-plicant. If a student wishes to submit a score or is required to do so, she should take the exams in her junior year to keep open the possibility of Early Decision. All examinations taken through December of the senior year are acceptable. The results of examinations taken after December arrive too late for us to include them in the decision-making process.     Whether required or optional, scores must come directly from the testing agency or the secondary school transcript. The College Board code number for Smith College is 3762. The ACT code is 1894.Applying for AdmissionA student interested in Smith has three options for applying—Early Decision I, Early Decision II and Regular Decision. Visit www.smith.edu/admission for infor-mation about requirements and deadlines.Early DecisionEarly Decision I and II Plans are designed for students with strong qualifications who have selected Smith as their first choice. The plans differ from each other only in application deadline, recognizing that students may decide on their college preference at different times. In making an application to her first choice college, a candidate eliminates much of the anxiety, effort and cost of preparing several college applications. Candidates under this plan may initiate applications to other colleges, but may make an Early Decision application to one college only. It is im-portant to note that if accepted under Early Decision, a candidate must withdraw all other college applications and may not make any further applications.     Applicants deferred in either Early Decision plan will be reconsidered in the spring, together with applicants in the Regular Decision Plan. Offers of admis-sion are made with the understanding that the high school record continues to be of high quality through the senior year. If they have applied for financial aid by the published deadlines, candidates will be notified of financial aid decisions at the same time as the admission decision.Regular DecisionThe Regular Decision Plan is designed for students who wish to keep open several college options during the application process. Candidates may submit applications anytime before the January 15 deadline.     A student interested in Smith should apply using either the Common Ap-plication or the Coalition Application. Smith does not have a preference for one application over the other; both of these application types will receive equal con-sideration in our admission process. Please visit www.commonapp.org or www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org for all required forms and instructions.     We realize that applying to college involves a lot of time-consuming paper-work for the applicant. It is work that we review carefully and thoroughly, and we suggest that applicants do not leave it to the last moment.Advanced PlacementSmith College participates in the Advanced Placement Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Please refer to the Academic Rules and Procedures section for information governing eligibility for and use of Ad-vanced Placement credit.International BaccalaureateThe amount of credit will be determined as soon as an official copy of results has been sent to the registrar’s office. Guidelines for use are comparable to those for Advanced Placement.Admission 37InterviewWe recommend an interview for all candidates. For those who live or attend school within 200 miles of the college an on-campus interview is encouraged. Others should visit our website to obtain the name of an alumna interviewer in their area. The interview allows each candidate to become better acquainted with Smith and to exchange information with a member of the staff of the Of-fice of Admission or a trained alumna volunteer.Deferred EntranceAn admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith’s offer and paid the required deposit may defer her entrance to work, travel or pursue a special interest if she makes this request in writing by June 1 to the dean of admission, who will review the request and notify the stu-dent within two weeks.Deferred Entrance for Medical ReasonsAn admitted first-year, Ada Comstock Scholar or transfer applicant who has accepted Smith’s offer and paid the required deposit may request to postpone her entrance due to medical reasons if she makes this request in writing, explaining the nature of the medical problem, to the dean of admission prior to the first day of classes. At that time, the college will outline expectations for progress over the course of the year. A Board of Admission subcommittee will meet the following March to review the student’s case. Readmission is not guaranteed.Transfer AdmissionA student may apply for transfer to Smith College in January or September after the completion of one or more semesters at another institution.     For January entrance, she must submit her application and send all creden-tials by November 15. The suggested filing date for September entrance is Febru-ary 1, especially for students applying for financial aid. The application deadline is May 15. Letters from the financial aid office are mailed at the same time as admission letters.     We expect a transfer student to have a strong academic record and to be in good standing at the institution she is attending. We look particularly for evidence of achievement in college, although we also consider her secondary school record. Her program should correlate with the general Smith College requirements.     We require a candidate for the degree of bachelor of arts to spend at least two years in residence at Smith College in Northampton, during which time she normally completes 64 credits. A student may not transfer to the junior class and spend any part of the junior or senior year studying in off-campus programs.International StudentsWe welcome applications from qualified international students and advise applicants to communicate with the Office of Admission at least one year in advance of their proposed entrance. The initial email or letter should include information about the student’s complete academic background. If financial aid is needed, this fact should be made clear in the initial correspondence.Visiting Year ProgramsSmith College welcomes a number of guest students for a semester or a year of study. In the Visiting Student Program, students enrolled in accredited, four-year liberal arts colleges or universities in the United States may apply to spend all or part of their sophomore, junior or senior year at Smith.     International students may apply to spend one semester or a year at Smith under the International Visiting Program. Applicants must be in their final year of studies leading to university entrance in their own country or currently enrolled in a university program abroad. If accepted, candidates will be expected to present examination results—Baccalaureate, Abitur or GCSE, for example—before enrolling. Evidence of English fluency will be required of applicants whose first language is not English.     Applicants for visiting programs should complete the Common Application for Transfer students. All required forms and instructions for completing the ap-plication are available on the Common Application website. Applications must be completed by July 1 for September entrance and by November 15 for January entrance. Financial aid is not available for these programs.     Information and application material may be obtained by visiting www.smith.edu/admission-aid or sending email to admission@smith.edu.ReadmissionSee the Withdrawal and Readmission section. Ada Comstock Scholars ProgramThe admission process for Ada Comstock Scholars is competitive. Particular em-phasis is placed on academic achievement, an autobiographical essay and an exchange of information in the required interview. A candidate should schedule her interview appointment before submitting her application prior to the appro-priate deadline, November 15 for January admission or February 1 for Septem-ber admission. Interviews are usually conducted in person. Phone interviews can be arranged if distance is an issue. It is recommended that an applicant bring unofficial copies of her college transcripts to her interview appointment.     Ada Comstock Scholars are expected to have completed approximately 48 transferable liberal arts credits before matriculation at Smith. The average number of transfer credits for an admitted student is 52. Those students who offer little or no college-level work are advised to enroll elsewhere to fulfill this requirement before initiating the application process. A candidate’s status as an Ada Comstock Scholar must be designated at the time of application. Normally, an applicant admitted as a student of traditional age will not be permitted to change her class status to Ada Comstock Scholar until five years after she withdraws as a student of traditional age. A woman who meets the transfer credit guideline must apply as an Ada Comstock Scholar if she also meets the federal government’s guidelines defining independent stu-dents:• at least 24 years old by December 31 of the academic year in which they enter Smith• a veteran• responsible for dependent(s) other than a spouse A brief description of the program can be found on page 14. Information about expenses and procedures for applying for financial aid can be found in the section entitled Fees, Expenses and Financial Aid. Inquiries in writing, by phone or by email may be addressed to the Office of Admission.38 Academic Rules and ProceduresRequirements for the DegreeThe requirements for the degree from Smith College are completion of 128 credits of academic work and satisfactory completion of a major. For graduation the minimum standard of performance is a cumulative average of 2.0 in all academic work and satisfactory completion (grade of C- or higher) of a writing intensive course in the first two semesters of enrollment.  Students earning a bachelor of arts degree must complete at least 64 credits outside the department or program of the major (56 credits for majors requir-ing the study of two foreign languages taught within a single department or program). Consult the “Academic Program” section for additional detail. The requirements for the bachelor of science degree in engineering are listed in the courses of study section under Engineering. Candidates for the degree must complete at least four semesters of academic work, a minimum of 64 credits, in academic residence at Smith College in Northampton; two of these semesters must be completed during the junior or senior year. Courses taken through the Five College Interchange count toward the 64-credit academic residence requirement. A student on a Smith Study Abroad Program, the Jean Picker Semester-in-Washington Program or the Internship Pro-gram at the Smithsonian Institution is not in academic residence in Northampton. Each student is responsible for knowing all regulations governing the cur-riculum and course registration and is responsible for planning a course of study in accordance with those regulations and the requirements for the degree.Course ProgramThe normal course program for traditional-aged undergraduates consists of 16 credits taken in each of eight semesters at Smith. Only with the approval of the administrative board may a student complete her degree requirements in fewer or more than eight semesters. The minimum course program for a traditional-aged undergraduate in any semester is 12 credits. A traditional-aged student who is enrolled in fewer than 12 credits in any semester is required to withdraw at the end of that semester. The student must remain away from the college for at least one semester and then may request readmission for the following semester. Approved summer session or interterm credit may be used to supplement a minimum 12-credit program or to make up a shortage of credits. Smith stu-dents may accrue a maximum of 12 summer session credits and 12 interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree. An overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits may be applied toward the degree. A student enters her senior year after completing a maximum of six semes-ters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter the senior year with fewer than 96 credits: exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student’s return to campus for her final two semesters. A student in residence may carry no more than 24 cred-its per semester unless approved by the administrative board.Admission to CoursesInstructors are not required to hold spaces for students who do not attend the first class meeting and may refuse admittance to students seeking to add courses who have not attended the first class meetings.PermissionsSome courses require written permission of the instructor and/or chair of the department concerned before the course is elected.Academic Rules and Procedures A student who does not have the prerequisites for a course may elect it only with the permission of the instructor and the chair of the department in which the course is offered. A student must petition the administrative board for permission to enter or drop a yearlong course with credit at midyear. The petition must be signed by the instructor of the course, the student’s adviser and the chair of the depart-ment concerned before it is submitted to the class dean.SeminarsSeminars are limited to 12 students and are open, by permission of the instruc-tor, to juniors, seniors and graduate students only. At the discretion of the in-structor and with the approval of the department chair or the program director, 15 students may enroll. If enrollment exceeds this number, the instructor will select the best-qualified candidates.Special StudiesPermission of the instructor, the department chair and in some cases the de-partment is required for the election of special studies. Special studies are open only to qualified sophomores, juniors and seniors. A maximum of 16 credits of special studies may be counted toward the degree. The deadline for submission of the special studies application is the fifth day of classes in the semester. Normally students may not change the designated number of credits for a variable-credit special studies.AuditingA degree student at Smith or at the Five Colleges may audit a course on a regu-lar basis if space is available and the permission of the instructor is obtained. An audit is not recorded on the transcript.Auditing by Nonmatriculated StudentsA nonmatriculated student who has earned a high school diploma and who wishes to audit a course may do so with the permission of the instructor and the registrar. An auditor must submit a completed registration form to the registrar’s office by the end of the second week of classes. A fee will be charged and is de-termined by the type of course. Studio classes may not be audited except by per-mission of the art faculty following a written request to the department. Official records of audits are not maintained.Course RegistrationEarly RegistrationEligible students are expected to participate in the early registration periods, normally scheduled in November and April. During the two-week early registra-tion period, students may register for no more than 19 credits.Adding and Dropping CoursesDuring the first 10 class days of a semester, a student may add or drop a course with the approval of the adviser and after consultation with the instructor. Dur-ing this period, a student may register for up to 24 credits. Courses may be added online through BannerWeb during the first five class days only. From the 6th to the 10th day students may add courses with the permission of the instructor and adviser; from the 11th through the 15th day of class, a student may add a course with the permission of the instructor, the adviser and the class dean. After the 10th day of classes a student may drop a course up to the end of the fifth week of the semester under the following conditions.Academic Rules and Procedures 391. after discussion with the instructor;2. with the approval of the adviser and the class dean; and3. if, after dropping the course, she is enrolled in at least 12 credits. (This provi-sion does not apply to Ada Comstock Scholars.)After the end of the fifth week of the semester a student may not drop a course. However, on two and only two occasions during her years at the college—once during her first year; once during any subsequent year—a student may “free drop” a course at any time up to the end of the ninth week of classes, for any reason, without penalty. The drop form requires the signatures of the instructor, adviser and class dean. All add and drop deadlines for half-semester courses are prorated according to the above schedule and are published online each semester at the registrar’s office website. A student should carefully consider the work load entailed in a seminar or course with limited enrollment before she enrolls. A student who wishes to drop a class of this nature should do so at the earliest possible moment so that an-other student may take advantage of the opening. Because the organization and operation of such courses are often critically dependent on the students enrolled, the instructor may refuse permission to drop the course after the first 10 class days. A course dropped for reasons of health after the fifth week of classes will be recorded on the transcript with a grade of “W,” unless the student has the option of a free drop. A student registers for an interterm course in November, with the approval ofher adviser. In January, a student may drop or add an interterm course withinthe published add/drop period. (Please see the registrar’s office website for reg-istration and add/drop deadlines.) Otherwise, the student who registers but does not attend will receive a “U” (unsatisfactory) for the course. Regulations governing changes in enrollment for courses in the Five College Interchange may be more restrictive than the above. Instructions and deadlinesfor registration in Five College courses are published online by the registrar’soffice.Fine for Late RegistrationA student who has not registered for courses by the end of the first 10 days of classes will be fined $35, payable at the time of registration. In addition, a fine of $35 will be assessed for each approved petition to add or drop a course after the deadline. A student who has not registered by the end of the first four weeks of the semester will be administratively withdrawn.Course Work and Class AttendanceStudents are expected to attend all their scheduled classes. Any student who is unable, because of religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any examination, study or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from such activities without prejudice and shall be given an opportunity to make them up. Students are asked to introduce guests to the instructor of a class before the beginning of the class if there is an opportunity and at the end if there is not. Absence does not relieve the student from responsibility for work required while she was absent. The instructor may require her to give evidence that she has done the work assigned. In courses in which the written examinations can test only a part of the work, the instructor may rule that a student who does not attend class with reasonable regularity has not presented evidence that she has done the work. The due date for final papers in each semester can be no later than the end of the examination period. Instructors must specify the acceptable format, exact deadline and place of delivery for final papers. If a paper or other course work is mailed to an instructor, it must be sent by certified mail, return receipt re-quested, and the student must keep a paper copy. It is the student’s responsibility to check that work submitted by email or fax has been received by the professor.Deadlines and ExtensionsOnly the class dean may authorize an extension for any reason beyond the end of the final examination period. Such extensions, granted for reasons of illness, emergency or extenuating personal circumstances, will always be confirmed in writing with the faculty member, the registrar and the student. An individual faculty member, without authorization by the class dean, may grant extensions on work due during the semester through the last day of final exams.Pre-Examination PeriodThe pre-examination study period, between the end of classes and the begin-ning of final examinations, is set aside for students to prepare for examinations. Therefore, the college does not schedule social, academic or cultural activities during this time. Deadlines for papers, take-home exams or other course work cannot be during the pre-examination study period.Final ExaminationsMost final exams at Smith are self-scheduled and administered by the registrar during predetermined periods. A student may choose in which period she wants to take each exam. Exams are picked up at distribution centers after showing a picture ID and must be returned to the same center no more than two hours and 20 minutes from the time they are received by the student. Extra time taken to write an exam is considered a violation of the Academic Honor Code and will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. A student who is late for an exam may write for the remaining time in the examination period but may not have additional time. Exams that involve slides, dictation or listening comprehen-sion are scheduled by the registrar. Such examinations may be taken only at the scheduled time. For information regarding illness during the examination period, call Health Services at extension 2800 for instructions. Students who become ill dur-ing an examination must report directly to Health Services. Further details of the Academic Honor Code as they apply to examinations and class work are given in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/handbook). Regulations of the faculty and the registrar regarding final exami-nation procedures are published online at the registrar’s office website prior to the final examination period. No scheduled or self-scheduled examination may be taken outside the regu-lar examination period without prior permission of the administrative board. Written requests must be made to the administrative board through the class dean (not to individual faculty members). Requests to take final examinations early will not be considered; therefore, travel plans must be made accordingly.Five College Course EnrollmentsStudents planning to enroll in a course at Amherst, Hampshire and Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts may submit their requests online through BannerWeb. Five College course requests should be submit-ted during the period for advising and registration of courses for the coming semester. Course information is available online through the Five College online course guide or at the individual websites of the other four institutions. Free bus transportation to and from the institution is available for Five College students. Students in good standing are eligible to take a course at one of the other institutions: first-semester first-year students must obtain the permission of the class dean. Second-semester first-year students may take a course within the Five College system provided the student has earned a GPA of 3.0 or better in the first semester. A second-semester firstyear who wishes to enroll in two Five College courses needs permission from the first-year class dean. A traditional student must enroll in a minimum of 8 credits at Smith in any semester; an Ada Comstock scholar may take no more than half of her course program off campus. A student must register for an approved course at one of the other four institutions by the end of the interchange deadline (the first two weeks of the 40 Academic Rules and Proceduressemester). Students must adhere to the registration procedures and deadlines of their home institution. A list of Five College courses approved for Smith College degree credit is available at the registrar’s office. Requests for approval of courses not on the list may be submitted to the registrar’s office for review; however, Smith College does not accept all Five College courses for credit toward the Smith degree. Courses offered through their continuing education, extension or other nondegree pro-grams are not part of the Five College Interchange. Students may not receive transfer credit for such courses completed while in residence at Smith College, but may receive transfer credit for those offered during interterm and summer. Students taking a course at one of the other institutions are, in that course,subject to the academic regulations, including the calendar, grading option deadlines and academic honor system, of the host institution. Students taking Five College interchange courses will be awarded the credit value assigned by the host institution. It is the responsibility of the student to be familiar with the pertinent regulations of the host institution, including those for attendance, academic honesty, grading options and deadlines for completing coursework and taking examinations. Students follow the registration add/drop deadlines of their home institution. Regulations governing changes in enrollment in Five College courses are published online at the beginning of each semester at the registrar’s office website.Academic CreditSmith College complies with federal regulations defining a credit hour. Normal-ly, a four-credit course involves 12 hours per week of academically engaged time over the course of the semester. Academically engaged time is generally three class or contact hours per week plus nine additional hours of academic work for the course per week. For courses carrying more or fewer than four credits, the Smith College expectation is three hours per week of academically engaged time per credit over the course of the semester.Grading SystemGrades are recorded by the registrar at the end of each semester. Grade reports are made available online through BannerWeb at that time.    Grades at Smith indicate the following:A (4.0) C- (1.7)A- (3.7) D+ (1.4)B+ (3.3) D (1.0) B (3.0) D- (0.7)B- (2.7)  E (0.0)  C+ (2.3) S satisfactory(C- or better)C (2.0) U unsatisfactory  X official extension authorized by the class dean   M unreported grade calculated as a failure     Grades earned in Five College courses are recorded as submitted by the host institution. A Five College incomplete grade is equivalent to a failing grade and is calculated as such until a final grade is submitted. An incomplete grade will be converted to a failing grade on the student’s official record if coursework is not completed by the end of the following semester.Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory OptionCoursework in any one semester may be taken for a satisfactory (C- or better)/unsatisfactory grade, providing that:1.  the instructor approves the option;2.  the student declares the grading option for Smith courses by the end of the ninth week of classes. Students enrolled in Five College courses must declare the option at the host campus and follow the deadlines of that institution. The fall deadline also applies to yearlong courses designated by a “D” in the course number. In yearlong courses designated by a “Y” students may elect a separate grading option for each semester. Students electing the satisfactory/unsatisfactory (S/U) option for both semesters of a yearlong course must do so each semester. Within the 128 credits required for the degree, a maximum of 16 credits(Smith or other Five College) may be taken for the S/U grading option, regard-less of how many graded credits students are enrolled in per semester. Some departments will not approve the S/U grading option for courses counting to-ward the major. Credits earned in courses with a mandatory S/U grading option are not counted toward the 16-credit limit. S/U grades do not count in the grade point average. An Ada Comstock Scholar or a transfer student may elect the S/U grading option for four credits out of every 32 that she takes at Smith College.Repeating CoursesEffective in the fall 2017 semester, students may repeat for credit a course taken at Smith in which a grade of C or lower was earned. A maximum of two courses may be repeated during the student’s period of enrollment. Permission of the student’s liberal arts or major faculty adviser and the course instructor is re-quired. A Smith course may be repeated at Smith only, not at another institution (including those in the Five College Interchange). A student repeating a course that was passed (a grade of D- or higher) and for which credit was earned will receive no additional course credit toward graduation. All grades earned in courses, including any repeated courses, will appear and remain on the student’s transcript. Only the higher grade of a repeated course will be calcu-lated into the term and cu mulative GPAs, however. It is the student’s responsibility to register a repeated course properly with the registrar’s office at the time of registration by submitting a completed course repeat authorization form. Topics and other courses that are noted as repeatable for credit in the course description or department/program catalog section are not subject to this policy, unless the student receives permission to repeat the same topic and meets all criteria above. Students should refer to the registrar’s office website (www.smith.edu/about-smith/registrar/policies-guidelines) for the complete course repeat policy.Performance CreditsStudents are allowed to count a limited number of performance credits towardthe Smith degree. The maximum number allowed is indicated in the Courses ofStudy section under the appropriate departments (dance, exercise and sport sci-ence, and music). Excess performance credits are included on the transcript but do not count toward the degree.Shortage of CreditsA shortage of credits incurred by failing or dropping a course may be made up by an equivalent amount of work carried above the normal 16-credit program, or with approved summer session or interterm courses accepted for credit to-ward the Smith College degree. In the case of failure in a course or dropping a course for reasons of health, a shortage may be filled with a student’s available Advanced Placement or other pre-matriculation credits. Any student with more than a two-credit shortage may be required to complete the shortage before re-turning for classes in a subsequent semester. A student enters the senior year after completing a maximum of six semes-ters and earning at least 96 Smith College or approved transfer credits. A student may not enter her senior year with fewer than 96 credits; exceptions require a petition to the administrative board prior to the student’s return to campus for her final two semesters. A student may not participate in a Smith-sponsored or affiliated Study Abroad or exchange program with a shortage of credit.Academic Rules and Procedures 41Transfer CreditA student who attends another accredited college or university and requests credit toward a Smith College degree for the work done there:1. should make her plans in accordance with the regulations concerning off-campus study and, in the case of seniors, in accordance with the regulations concerning academic residence;2. should obtain, from the registrar’s office, the guidelines for transferring credit. Official transcripts should be sent directly to the registrar from the other institution;3. must, if approved to study abroad, have her program approved in advance by the Committee on Study Abroad.Final evaluation of credit is made after receipt of the official transcript showing satisfactory completion of the program. A student may not receive credit for work completed at another institution while in residence at Smith College, except for interterm courses and courses taken on the Five College interchange. Credit is not normally granted for online courses. Transfer credit policies and guidelines are published online at the registrar’soffice website and are available in the office. Students may not transfer credit for academic work completed at an international institution while withdrawn from the college.Summer Session CreditStudents may accrue a maximum of 12 approved summer session credits toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined sum-mer, interterm, AP and pre-matriculation credits. With the prior approval of the registrar, summer credit may be used to allow students to make up a shortage of credits or to undertake an accelerated course program. For transfer students and Ada Comstock Scholars, summer session credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum.Interterm CreditThe college may offer courses for credit during the interterm period. Such cours-es will carry one to four credits and will count toward the degree. The college will consider for-credit academic interterm courses taken at other institutions for transfer credit. The number of credits accepted for each interterm course (normally up to 3) will be determined by the registrar upon review of the credits assigned by the host institution. Any interterm course designated as 4 credits by a host institution must be reviewed by the class deans and the registrar to deter-mine whether it merits an exception to the 3-credit limit. Students may accrue a maximum of 12 approved interterm credits at Smith or elsewhere toward their Smith degree with an overall maximum of 32 credits of combined summer, interterm, AP and prematriculation credits. Normally, students may not take more than 4 credits during any one interterm at Smith or elsewhere. For transfer students, interterm credits completed prior to enrollment at Smith College are included in the 12-credit maximum. The interterm may also be a period of reading, research or concentrated study for both students and faculty. Faculty, students or staff may offer noncredit instruction or experimental projects in this period. Special conferences may be scheduled and field trips may be arranged at the discretion of individual mem-bers of the faculty. Libraries, the Center for Foreign Languages and Cultures, practice rooms and physical education facilities will remain open at the discre-tion of the departments concerned. This period also provides time for work in libraries, museums and laboratories at locations other than Smith College. Students returning from a fall leave of absence or study elsewhere may par-ticipate in interterm, but are not guaranteed housing.College Credit Earned Before MatriculationSmith College will accept college credit with a grade of B- or better earned at an accredited college or university before matriculation as a first-year student. Such credit must be approved according to Smith College guidelines for transfer credit and submitted on an official college or university transcript. Such credits must be taken on the college or university campus with matriculated degree students and must be taught by a college or university professor. The course may not be listed on the high school transcript as counting toward high school graduation. Note that the restriction of 32 credits applied toward the Smith degree holds for any combination of Advanced Placement (AP) and/or college credit earned before matriculation. Prematriculation credits may be used in the same manner as AP credits toward the Smith degree and may not be used to fulfill the distribu-tion requirements for Latin Honors. Summer credits earned before matricula-tion will be counted in the 12-credit limit of summer credit applicable to the Smith degree. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, International Baccalaureate (IB), other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted towards the degree.Advanced PlacementSmith College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. AP credit may be used with the approval of the administrative board only (1) to make up a shortage of credits incurred through failure; (2) to make up a shortage of credit incurred as a result of drop-ping a course for reasons of health; or (3) to undertake an accelerated course program. AP credit may not be added to a student’s record to make up for a fail-ing grade received as a result of an Honor Board sanction. Credits are recorded for scores of 4 or 5 on most AP examinations. The credits to be recorded for each examination are determined by the individual department. For students entering the college in September 2012 and later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP and other prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree. Students who complete courses that cover substantially the same material as those for which AP credit is recorded may not then apply that AP credit to-ward the degree requirements. The individual departments will determine what courses cover the same material. The individual departments will determine placement in or exemption from Smith courses and the use of Advanced Placement credit to fulfill major require-ments. No more than 8 credits will be granted toward the major in any one department. AP credit may be used to count toward the 64 credits outside the major department or program but may not be used to fulfill the distribution require-ments for Latin Honors.International Baccalaureate and Other Diploma ProgramsCredit may be awarded for the International Baccalaureate (IB) and some 13th-year programs outside the United States. The amount of credit is determined by the registrar upon review of the final results. Such credits may be used toward the Smith degree in the same manner as AP credits and may not be used to fulfill the distribution requirements for Latin Honors. For students entering the college in September 2012 or later, a maximum of one semester (16 credits) of AP, IB, other diploma and prematriculation credit may be counted toward the degree.Academic StandingA student is in good academic standing as long as she is matriculated at Smith and is considered by the administrative board to be making satisfactory progress toward the degree. The academic standing of all students is reviewed at the end of each semester.42 Academic Rules and ProceduresAcademic ProbationA student whose academic record is below 2.0, either cumulatively or in a given semester, will be placed on academic probation for the subsequent semester. Probationary status is a warning. Notification of probationary status is made in writing to the student, her family and her academic adviser. Instructors of a student on probation may be asked to make academic reports to the class deans’ offices during the period of probation. The administrative board will review a student’s record at the end of the following semester to determine what action is appropriate. The administrative board may require such a student to change her course program, to complete summer study or to withdraw from the college. Any student on academic probation who is required by the Administrative Board to earn credit at another institution must earn a B- or better in each course in order for the course to transfer for credit at Smith. In general, a student on probation is advised to take no more than 16 cred-its. She may not enroll in courses through the Five College interchange, and may not run for or hold elected or selected office, either campus wide or withinher house. A student on probation is not considered to be in good academic standing, is not eligible to study abroad, and may not compete in intercollegiate athletics or club sports. Standards for Satisfactory ProgressA student is not making satisfactory progress toward the degree if she remains on academic probation for more than two consecutive semesters. In addition (1) for students of traditional age, the record cannot have more than an eight-credit shortage for more than two consecutive semesters (2) for Ada Comstock Scholars, at least 75 percent of all credits attempted in any academic semester must be completed satisfactorily. Students not meeting this criterion may be placed on academic probation or required to withdraw; if students are receiving financial aid, they will be placed on financial aid warning and may become ineligible for financial aid if the probationary period exceeds one year. Further information is available from the class deans’ office and the Office of Student Financial Services.Absence from ClassesA student who is absent from classes for more than four weeks in any semester will not receive credit for the work of that semester and will be administratively withdrawn from the college.Separation from the CollegeA student whose college work or conduct is deemed unsatisfactory is subject to separation from the college by action of the administrative board, the honor board, the college judicial board or the dean of the college. There will be no refund for tuition or room fees.Administrative BoardThe administrative board administers the academic requirements defined by faculty legislation. In general, academic matters affecting students are referred to this board for action or recommendation. The board consists of the dean of the college (chair), the class deans, the dean of the Ada Comstock Scholars, the registrar and three faculty members appointed by the president. Petitions for exceptions to academic regulations are submitted in writing to the administrative board through the class dean, with appropriate faculty ap-provals. The administrative board will reconsider a decision only on the basis of gross error in procedure, new information that was not available at the time the original decision was made or extreme bias on the part of the Administrative Board. Appeals based on disagreement of the decision will not be considered. The board has the authority to take action with respect to the academic per-formance of individual students, including the requirement that a student must leave the college.Student Academic GrievancesThe Smith College community has always been dedicated to the advancement of learning and the pursuit of truth under conditions of freedom, trust, mutual respect and individual integrity. The learning experience at Smith is rooted in the free exchange of ideas and concerns between faculty members and students. Students have the right to expect fair treatment and to be protected against any inappropriate exercise of faculty authority. Similarly, instructors have the right to expect that their rights and judgments will be respected by students and other faculty members. When differences of opinion or misunderstanding about what constitutes fairness in requirements or procedures leads to conflict, it is hoped that these differences will be resolved directly by the individuals involved. When disputes cannot be resolved informally by the parties involved, procedures have been es-tablished to achieve formal resolution. These procedures are explained in detail in the Smith College Handbook (www.smith.edu/sao/handbook).Privacy and the Age of MajorityUnder Massachusetts law, the age of majority is 18 and carries full adult rights and responsibilities. The college normally communicates directly with students in matters concerning grades, academic credit and standing. In communications with parents concerning most matters, it is normallycollege policy to respect the privacy of the student and not to disclose informa-tion from student educational records without the prior consent of the student, consistent with the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA).  At the request of the student, such information will be provided to parents and guardians. Students may authorize the release of information from their education records to their parents by completing the appropriate form at the registrar’s office. However, FERPA makes clear that information from the educational records of students who are dependents of their parents for Internal Revenue Service purposes may be disclosed to the parents without the student’s prior consent. It is the policy of the college to notify both the dependent student and her parents in writing of probationary status, dismissal and certain academic warnings. Any student who is not a dependent of her parents, as defined by the Internal Rev-enue Code, must notify the registrar of the college in writing, with supporting evidence satisfactory to the college, by October 1 of each academic year.Leaves, Withdrawal and ReadmissionOff-Campus Study or Personal LeavesA student who wishes to be away from the college for a semester or academic year must submit a request for approved off-campus study or personal leave.www.smith.edu/classdeans/guidelines_leaves.phpThe request must be filed with the student’s class dean by • May 1 for a fall semester or academic year absence• December 1 for a second semester absence.  Students in good academic standing who miss these deadlines and wish to go on leave may request a late leave through the class dean. Students are eligi-ble for leave status for one year; after that a student must withdraw. Information about readmission procedures can be on the class deans’ website. Any student studying elsewhere, either abroad through the InternationalStudy Office or elsewhere in the United States, must file a request for approvedoff-campus study by the appropriate deadline.Academic Rules and Procedures 43 Transfer students who apply 38 or fewer credits from their previous institution(s) to their Smith academic record may study abroad for a semester or a year; students who apply between 39 and 54 transfer credits to their Smith aca-demic record may study abroad for one semester. In both instances, students must work with the registrar’s office upon their return to campus to have their transfer credits adjusted. Academic residency requirements may also apply. Students should consult the “Transfer Admission” and “Requirements for the Degree” sec-tions for details. All students expecting to earn credit should have any course they wish to transfer preapproved by the registrar. The guidelines for transfer credit can be found at www.smith.edu/about-smith/registrar/transfer-credit A student who wishes to earn credit elsewhere during either semester of hersenior year must request approval by submitting a Senior Year Elsewhere formto the senior class dean that includes all the specific courses necessary for the completion of all major and minor requirements; and is endorsed by her adviser and the chair of her department. An official transcript must be sent directly from the institution where credit is earned to the registrar at Smith College for transfer credit to be applied to a Smith record. A student must be in good standing to be eligible to transfer credit to Smith.Short-Term Leave for Special Circumstances—Mid-SemesterA student who is away from campus for an extended period of time during the semester (one to two weeks) may be placed on a short-term leave status by Health Services or by the class dean. Instructors will be notified of the student’s status by the class deans office. Any student placed on short-term leave by Health Services must receive clearance from Health Services before returning to campus. Health Services may require documentation from the student’s health care provider before the stu-dent is eligible to return.  Every student placed on short-term leave for special circumstances by the dean must make an appointment with that appropriate class dean on her return in order to plan for the remainder of the semester.Withdrawal Between SemestersA student who plans to withdraw from the college should notify her class dean. When notice of withdrawal for the coming semester is given before June 30 or December 1, the student’s general deposit ($100) is refunded. Official confirma-tion of the withdrawal will be sent to the student by the class dean.Withdrawal During the SemesterAny student who decides to leave campus at any point for any reason and not finish her course work for the semester must withdraw. Official confirmation of the withdrawal will be sent to the student and her parents by the class dean.  The administrative board reviews the records of all student who withdraw during the semester from the college for any reason and may impose require-ments on the student in order to be eligible to be considered for readmission. When the student is ready to return she may request readmission through her class dean. Information and forms can be found at the class deans’ website. Should the withdrawal be due to • difficulty in meeting academic expectations • medical reasons• concerns about the student’s safety the student will be expected to provide documentation of improved functioning when requesting readmission. Readiness to return may be demonstrated by • engagement in sustained full time employment• consistent volunteer work or • study elsewhere at an accredited institution of higher learning in the United States. The student will be asked to present a plan for progress towards the degree and completion of major requirements and when appropriate articulate a plan for self-care. In the case of a withdrawal from the college for medical reasons, the director of health services (or the associate director when specified) will also request a full report from the student’s health care provider and may also request docu-mentation of improved functioning and a personal interview.  Clearance by the Health Services does not automatically guarantee readmis-sion as the administrative board makes the final decision regarding readmis-sion.  If the student leaves the college within the first five weeks of the semester, the administrative board may grant an additional semester upon the student’s return in order to complete the degree. Normally, an additional semester is not granted if the student withdraws after the fifth week.Required Medical WithdrawalThe director, the associate director of Health Services, or an Evaluation Commit-tee convened by the dean of students may require a student to withdraw during the semester when the student’s behavior or functioning is impaired to the degree that the student • cannot meet academic milestones, • poses a risk to herself or others • cannot receive appropriate and necessary treatment at the college. Further information on the policy on required medical withdrawal can be found at www.smith.edu/sao/handbook/policies/medleave.php.Readmission A withdrawn student who wishes to return to the college after an absence of fewer than six years must follow the readmission application process, as detailed on the class deans’ website. Readmission requests for return in September must be sent to the class deans’ office before March 1; for readmission in January, before November 1. The administrative board acts upon all requests for readmission and nor-mally requires that the student meet or speak with the appropriate class dean todiscuss her plans for completion of the degree. The administrative board may also request that the student contact the di-rector of Health Services before considering a readmission request. Normally, students who have withdrawn from the college must be withdrawnfor at least one full semester. A student who chooses a mid-semester withdrawalis required to be withdrawn for the entire subsequent semester. A student who was formerly enrolled as a traditional student may not returnas an Ada Comstock Scholar unless she has been away from the college for fiveyears. Students may not transfer credit for academic work completed at an interna-tional institution while withdrawn from the college.  A withdrawn student who wishes to return after an absence of 6 or more years must apply for admission through the Office of Admission. Information regarding application deadlines is available on the admission website. Such students are strongly encouraged to show evidence of recent successful comple-tion of one semester of college-level coursework at an accredited institution.  Potential candidates are strongly encouraged to make an appointment with the Office of Admission.Additional InformationThis chapter contains current information regarding Smith College’s require-ments, policies and procedures. For additional information, including updates, deadlines and required forms, consult the registrar’s office and class deans office websites. 44 Graduate and Special ProgramsIntroductionSmith College offers men and women graduate work leading to the degrees of master of arts in teaching, master of fine arts and master of science. The one-year post-baccalaureate program in mathematics is designed for women who need additional preparation before applying to graduate programs in math-ematics. In special one-year programs, international students may qualify for a certificate of graduate studies or a diploma in American studies. In addition, master of arts and doctoral programs are offered in the School for Social Work Each year more than 100 men and women pursue such advanced work.  Smith College is noted for its superb facilities, bucolic setting and distin-guished faculty who are recognized for their scholarship and interest in teach-ing. Moreover, graduate students can expect to participate in small classes and receive personalized attention from instructors.     Most graduate courses, which are designated as 500-level courses in the course listings, are planned for graduate students who are degree candidates. The departments offering this work present a limited number of graduate sem-inars, advanced experimental work or special studies designed for graduate stu-dents. Graduate students may take advanced undergraduate courses, subject to availability and according to the provisions stated in the paragraphs describing the requirements for the graduate degrees. Departmental graduate advisers help graduate students individually to devise appropriate programs of study.AdmissionTo enter a graduate degree program, a student must have a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent, an undergraduate record of high caliber, and acceptance by the department concerned. Applicants who wish to be considered for financial aid must submit all required application materials by the deadline date for their programs of interest. (Refer also to the Financial Assistance section.) The dead-line for fall entry for most programs is January 15 and spring entry November 1. If no financial aid is needed, most master’s degree programs will accept late applications for fall until April 1. Exceptions: master of fine arts in dance, Janu-ary 5, with no late applications and no spring admission; master of science in biological sciences, no late applications and no spring admission; master of arts in teaching, rolling admission beginning December 1 and ending May 1; and post-baccalaureate/mathematics, March 15 for fall, October 15 for spring.     Applicants must submit the materials listed on the application for admis-sion, including the formal application form, the $60 application fee, the official transcript of the undergraduate record, letters of recommendation from instruc-tors at the undergraduate institution, and (in some cases) the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). Applicants from non-English-speaking countries must submit of-ficial results from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the In-ternational English Language Testing System (IELTS). International applicants from English-speaking countries must submit results from the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). All candidates must also submit a paper written in an advanced undergraduate course, except for MFA/playwriting candidates, who must submit one or more full-length scripts or their equivalent. Direct correspondence and questions to the Office of Graduate and Special Programs.     Smith College is committed to maintaining a diverse community in an at-mosphere of mutual respect and appreciation of differences.Graduate and Special ProgramsResidence RequirementsStudents who are registered for a graduate degree program at Smith College are considered to be in residence. A full-time graduate student takes a minimum course program of 12 credits per semester. A half-time student takes a minimum course program of eight credits per semester. With the approval of his or her academic adviser and the director of graduate and special programs, a student may take a maximum of 12 credits for degree credit at Amherst, Hampshire or Mount Holyoke colleges or the University of Massachusetts. No more than two courses (eight credits) will be accepted in transfer from outside of the Five Col-leges. We strongly recommend that work for advanced degrees be continuous; if it is interrupted or undertaken on a part-time basis, an extended period is permitted, but all work for a master’s degree normally must be completed within a period of four years. Exceptions to this policy will be considered by petition to the Administrative Board. During this period, a continuation fee of $60 will be charged each semester during which a student is not enrolled at Smith College in course work toward the degree.Leaves of AbsenceA student who wishes to be away from the college for a semester or academic year for personal reasons may request a leave of absence. The request must be filed with the director of graduate and special programs by May 1 for a fall semester or academic-year leave; by December 1 for a second-semester leave. No leaves of absence will be approved after May 1 for the following fall semester or academic year and December 1 for the spring semester, and the student must withdraw from the college.     A leave of absence may not be extended beyond one full academic year, and a student who wants to be away from the college for more than one year must withdraw.     A student on a leave of absence is expected to adhere to the policies regard-ing such leaves. A student’s tuition account must be in good standing or the leave of absence will be canceled.Degree ProgramsGrade requirements vary, depending on the program. The master of science in biological sciences, master of fine arts in dance, and master of fine arts in the-ater require that all work to be counted toward the degree (including the thesis) must receive grades of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. Students in the master of science in exercise and sport studies are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.0 or higher throughout the program, and the master of arts in teaching requires a student to have at least a 3.0 grade point average at the time of graduation in order to have earned the degree. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis. The requirements described below are minimal. Any department may set additional or special requirements and thereby increase the total number of courses involved.Master of Science in Biological SciencesThe Department of Biological Sciences maintains an active graduate program leading to the master of science in biological sciences. The program of study emphasizes independent research supported by advanced course work. Candi-Graduate and Special Programs 45dates are expected to demonstrate a strong background in the life sciences and a clear commitment to independent laboratory, field and/or theoretical research. The department offers opportunities for original work in a wide variety of fields, including animal behavior, biochemistry, cell and developmental biology, ecol-ogy, environmental science, evolutionary biology, genetics, marine biology, microbiology, molecular biology, neurobiology, plant sciences and physiology. Students pursuing the M.S. degree are required to participate in the Graduate Seminar (3, 413-585-3971.Master of Arts in TeachingThe program leading to the degree of master of arts in teaching is designed for students who are planning to teach in elementary, middle or high schools and those wishing to do advanced study in the field of education. The M.A.T. pro-gram combines study in the field of the student’s academic interest; the specific teaching field for students preparing to teach at the secondary or middle school levels, broader liberal arts and sciences subjects for students preparing to teach at the elementary level; with experience in teaching and the study of education theory. The departments of biological sciences, chemistry, English, geosciences, government, history, mathematics and physics actively cooperate with the De-partment of Education and Child Study in administering the various graduate programs.     The Department of Education and Child Study uses a variety of schools and settings to provide opportunities for observation, service learning and classroom teaching experiences. These include the laboratory elementary school operated by the college, the public schools of Northampton and other area communities, as well as several private schools.   Students who follow the Master of Arts in Teaching program will, in the course of an intensive five-week summer session and a full-time academic year, be able to complete the state-approved program in teacher education enabling them to meet requirements for licensure in various states.     Admission prerequisites and course requirements vary depending upon the specific program; more detailed information may be obtained from the director of graduate and special programs.     Prospective candidates should have a superior undergraduate record and should present evidence of personal qualifications for effective teaching. Those interested in the M.A.T. in secondary or middle school teaching should also pos-sess an appropriate concentration—normally a major—in the subject of the teaching field. Along with a resume, all applicants should submit a paper or other piece of work that is illustrative of their writing. Applicants with teaching experience should include a letter of recommendation concerning their teach-ing. We invite interested students to visit www.smith.edu/educ/ to learn more about our program and to find application materials.     To qualify for a degree, the candidate must have at least a 3.0 grade average at the time of graduation. Courses for graduate credit may not be taken on a satisfactory/unsatisfactory basis.Master of Fine Arts in DanceThe Dance Department offers a two-year M.F.A. degree program. All graduate theory courses are taught for graduate students only. Choreography and perfor-mance are the focus of the course of study, with additional work in the history and literature of dance, scientific principles applied to the teaching and perfor-mance of dance, seminars and production. Required technique courses may be taken at Smith or in any of the colleges in the Five College Dance Department. All M.F.A. students are teaching fellows and teach the equivalent of three studio courses at the undergraduate level each year. To count toward the degree, all work must earn a grade of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. The thesis includes a public presentation of original choreography along with supporting production elements.     An audition is required for entrance into the program. Interested students may consult the Smith and Five College Dance websites: www.smith.edu/dance and www.fivecolleges.edu/sites/dance, or contact the Dance Department directly: Dance Department, Smith College, Northampton, 3; phone 413-585-3232.Master of Fine Arts in PlaywritingThis program, offered by the Department of Theatre, provides specialized train-ing to candidates who have given evidence of professional promise in playwrit-ing. The Department of Theatre places great emphasis on collaborative work among designers, performers, directors and writers, thus offering a unique opportunity for playwrights to have their work nurtured and supported by others who work with it at various levels.     Sixty-four credit hours, including a thesis, and two years of residence are required. In a two-year sequence, a student would have eight required courses in directing, advanced playwriting and dramatic literature and a total of eight electives at the 300 level or above, with the recommendation that half be in dra-matic literature. Electives may be chosen from acting, directing and design/tech courses and from courses outside the department and within the Five Colleges. To count toward the degree, all work must receive a grade of at least B-, but the degree will not be awarded to a student who has no grade above this minimum. Interested students may consult the graduate adviser, Leonard Berkman, Department of Theatre, Smith College, Northampton, 3; 413-585-3206; email: lberkman@smith.edu.Master/Ph.D. of Social WorkThe School for Social Work offers a master of social work (M.S.W.) degree, which focuses on clinical social work and puts a heavy emphasis on direct field work practice. The program stresses the integration of clinical theory and prac-tice with an understanding of the social contexts in which people live. It also emphasizes an understanding of the social policies and organizational structure which influence our service delivery system. In addition, the school offers a doctoral program designed to prepare MSWs for leadership positions in clinical research, education and practice. It also has extensive postgraduate offerings through its Continuing Education Program.

A cumulative grade point average of 3.0 must be maintained throughout the program.Post-Baccalaureate Program: The Center for Women in Mathematics at Smith CollegeThe Post-Baccalaureate Program is for women strongly considering graduate school in the mathematical sciences but who did not major in mathematics or whose mathematics major was light. It provides an opportunity to study math-ematics intensively at the advanced undergraduate level. As part of the Center for Women in Mathematics, the program is nested in a mathematical community that is supportive, friendly, fun and serious about mathematics. The program builds the skills and confidence needed to continue to graduate school in the mathematical sciences. Each student has a faculty mentor. There are sessions on taking the GREs, applying to graduate school and surviving graduate school. Each student has the opportunity to join a research team supervised by a Smith faculty member. The program is for one or two semesters. Admission is competitive but open to all women who have graduated from college with coursework in mathematics that includes some upper-level mathematics (usually, at least Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus). RequirementsStudents must take at least 12 math credits each semester including math 300 and math 301. A Certificate of Completion is awarded to students who success-fully complete two semesters including or placing out of at least one course in algebra, one in analysis, and one at the level of 310 or higher. Students failing to make satisfactory progress in one semester will not be funded for a second se-mester. Passing 12 mathematics credits with grades of B- or higher and contin-ued serious interest in pursuing higher mathematics or statistics are necessary for satisfactory progress.Applications and Contact InformationFor more information, or to request application materials, please contact Julianna Tymoczko, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Smith College, Northampton, 3, telephone: 413 585-3775, email: math-chair@smith.eduFinancial AidScholarships are available to admitted post-baccalaureate students.

From the 11th through the 15th day of class, a student may enter a course with the permission of the instructor, the adviser and the director of graduate programs. After the 10th day of classes, a student may drop a course up to the end of the fifth week of the semester (October in the first semester and February in the second semester): 1) after consultation with the instructor; and 2) with the ap-proval of the adviser and the director of graduate programs. Instructions and deadlines for registration in Five College courses are distrib-uted by the registrar’s office.Policy Regarding Completion of Required Course WorkA graduate student who is unable to complete required course work on time must submit to the director of graduate programs a written request for an ex-tension before the end of the semester in which the grade is due. The request should include the reason the extension is needed and a specific date by which the student proposes to complete the work. The instructor of the course should also submit a statement in support of the extension. If the extension is granted, the work must be completed by the date agreed on by the director, instructor and student. No extensions may exceed one calendar year from the time of initial enrollment in the course. The initiative in arranging for the completion of course work rests with the student. 48 The Board of TrusteesThe Board of TrusteesKathleen McCartney, PresidentNorthampton, MA Deborah L.

A thesis is also required of each candidate for this degree. It may be limited in scope but must demonstrate scholarly competence; it is equivalent to a two-se-mester, eight-credit course. A copy must be presented to the committee for deposit in the library. The thesis may be completed in absentia only by special permission of the department and of the director of graduate and special programs.Master of Science in Exercise and Sport StudiesThe graduate program in exercise and sport studies focuses on preparing coaches for women’s intercollegiate teams. The curriculum blends theory courses in exercise and sport studies with hands-on coaching experience at the college level. By design, the program is a small one, with only 15 to 20 candi-dates in residence. This makes it possible for students to work independently with faculty and coaches. Smith has a history of excellence in academics and a wide-ranging intercollegiate program composed of 14 varsity sports. Entrance into the two-year program requires a strong undergraduate record and play-ing and/or coaching experience in the sport that a student will be coaching. Individuals who do not have undergraduate courses in exercise physiology and kinesiology should anticipate work beyond the normal 51 credits. For more information, contact the Department of Exercise and Sport Studies, Smith Col-lege, Northampton, ) and are expected to undertake a course of study, designed in conjunction with their adviser, that will include appropriate courses both within and outside the department.Additional information can be found in the Graduate and Special Programs section and at the following link:www.smith.edu/biology/graduate.phpAdviser: Jesse Bellemare Seminar on Recent Advances and Current Problems in the Biological SciencesStudents in this seminar discuss articles from the primary literature representing diverse fields of biology and present on their own research projects.

The minor is structured to give the student interdisciplinary training within key fields of knowledge: literature and the arts, social science and historical studies.Requirements: Six semester courses on Africa are required. One course must be drawn from each of the following three fields:Arts, Literature and Humanities; Historical Studies; Social SciencesNo more than two courses from a student’s major may be counted toward the minor. At the discretion of the adviser, equivalent courses at other colleges may be substituted for Five College courses.Language. Students interested in African studies are encouraged to study French, Portuguese or an African language. In addition, a student who has achieved inter-mediate-level competence in an African language may petition for this to count as one of the required courses in the field of arts, literature and humanities.Students with required language proficiency may apply for the Five College Afri-can Studies Certificate.Study Abroad. Students are encouraged to spend a semester or more in Africa. Information on current programs may be obtained from the African studies director and should be discussed with the minor adviser.Arts, Literature and Humanities"

Consequently, equal weight is given to studio practice and historical analysis. Courses focus on images and the built environment and seek to foster an understanding of visual culture and human expression in a given time and place. There is one art major, which may be taken in one of three variations: Plan A (History of Art, ARH), Plan B (Studio Art, ARS), or Plan C (Architecture, ARU).No course counting toward the fulfillment of the major or minor may be taken for an S/U grade. Courses associated with a concentration (such as IDP, M*UX*, etc.) cannot be counted toward the completion of the art major.Plan A. The History of ArtCourses in the history of art are divided into areas that reflect breadth in terms of both geography and chronology. Requirements: 11 courses distributed across geographic areas and cultures.ArtProfessorsBarbara A. Kellum, Ph.D., Associate Chair  A. Lee Burns, M.S.,M.F.A. *1 Brigitte Buettner, Ph.D.  John E.

Course substitutions require approval of the student’s adviser and assistant director or director of the engineering department.Liberal Arts BreadthAs with all BA degrees at Smith, the Engineering Arts degree requires 64 credits outside of the major.The major requires a total of 13 courses (or the equivalent).Engineering Science, Bachelor of ScienceAdvisers: Members of the Picker Engineering ProgramSmith offers an undergraduate curriculum leading to an ABET-accredited de-gree in engineering science, the broad study of the foundational scientific and *engineering principles *that govern the practice of all engineering disciplines. The bachelor of science degree program is accredited by the Engineering Ac-creditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. The American Society for Engineering Education, identifying the critical need for broadly educated engineers, points out that the design of an engineering curriculum should “rec-ognize the pitfalls of overspecialization in the face of an increasing demand for graduates who can demonstrate adaptability to rapidly changing technologies and to increasingly complex multinational markets.” An integral component of the program is the continuous emphasis on the use of engineering science principles in design. This culminates in a final capstone design project that incorporates broad-based societal aspects. Students are encouraged to pursue a corporate and/or research internship to complement their classroom instruc-tion. Engineers must be able to communicate effectively and work in team settings. Smith’s highly-regarded writing intensive first-year curriculum ensures that engineering students begin their engineering curriculum with appropriate communication skills that will be refined during the remainder of their studies. Every engineering course offered at Smith incorporates elements of teamwork and oral/written communication.Director, Picker Engineering ProgramAndrew John Guswa, Ph.D.  ProfessorsJudith B.

Students develop a sound understanding of the engineering design process, including problem definition, background research, identification of design criteria, development of metrics and methods for evaluating alternative designs, prototype development, and proof of concept testing. Working in teams, students present their ideas through oral and written reports. Reading assignments and in-class discussions challenge students to critically analyze contemporary issues related to the interaction of technology and society. Organized around different themes, multiple sections. Engineering majors are required to take this course. Those students considering majoring in engineering are strongly encouraged to take  during their first year. Enrollment limit of 20. Credits: 4Engineering 183How We Engineer the EnvironmentWe will search, query, examine, discuss, debate (agree and disagree)—and through the process, learn about the pressing issues related engineering and our environment. We will grapple with the urgent, pressing and complex challenges and potential engineering solutions for the sustainable stewardship of our envi-ronment. {N} Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsEnergy and the EnvironmentThrough readings, discussion, labs, and lectures students learn about human activity related to energy usage and the consequences to Earth’s environment. This knowledge is applied to motivate, design and build scale models of net-zero energy buildings. Through simple lab exercises, students learn to program microcon-trollers that measure temperatures and control features within their model build-ings, and corresponding analyses enable students to demonstrate how energy from the sun can be utilized in design to reduce carbon-based energy sources. {N} Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsChallenges in Human HealthWe will explore broadly how engineering design approaches can be used to ad-dress a variety of challenges in human health.  Through readings, discussions, lab experiences, short design assignments, and a semester-long team design project, we will work to identify open unmet biomedical needs, and learn a process for how to develop solutions to meet those needs.  The emphasis will be on first gaining a throrough understanding of an unmet need, and then on continually improving solution ideas, through testing and seeking feedback on the current set of possible solutions, and learning from failure. {N} Members of the departmentNormally offered in alternate yearsBits, Bots and ThoughtsThe topic of this version of  is human-robot interaction. Through case studies, projects, films, and readings, we discuss the design of robots in several contexts, such as health and caretaking, education, transportation, art, and entertainment. We also study some mechanical and electrical engineering areas that make robotics possible, such as sensors, control and feedback, and mecha-tronics. Course assignments and discussions link the applications with engineer-ing design and tradeoffs. Readings and films include popular and academic treatments of robotics within society. {N} Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 yearsSustainable Water ResourcesWe investigate and design water resources infrastructure – for hydropower, water supply, wastewater treatment, stormwater management, and irrigation. Those technologies are introduced through historical and contemporary examples, along with a theme of the importance of place in engineering design. In con-trast to design as invention, this course puts the emphasis on the adaptation of common designs to particular places, as influenced by climate, physical ge-ography, culture, history, economics, politics, and legal frameworks. Examples include the historic Mill River, Northampton’s water resources, Boston’s Deer Island wastewater treatment facility, San Francisco’s water supply system, Cali-fornia’s State Water Project and the Bay-Delta system, the Colorado River, and water recycling and reclamation. {N} Members of the departmentExpected to be offered in the next 3 years  Engineering for Everyone has several rotating themes and may count toward the minor when the focus is on energy, natural resources or sustainability.

Two practical experiences, which may include:• A minimum of a semester, or equivalent, studying abroad in the foreign language and culture.• An internship or independent research project that focuses on translation/interpretation or cross-cultural issues; that engages the foreign language in a significant way; and which may be undertaken while on study abroad.Financial support for internships or practical experiences are available through Smith’s own study abroad and consortia, Praxis, and International Experience Grants, as well as a number of other grants for specific regions available for stu-dents studying or interning abroad or in immigrant communities in the United States. The Study Abroad programs, the Office for International Study, and the Lazarus Career Center have built databases of students who have worked, in-terned or studied abroad with organizations or companies and that offer a ready resource for concentrators.Demonstration of achievement in the foreign language[s] from which the student translates. Student must reach a high intermediate level or B2 level according to the Common European Framework of References for Languages. Students are encouraged to take the officially recognized tests whenever pos-sible, for example, when studying abroad on Smith’s Study Abroad programs. Normally, advanced-level courses (at the 300 or above level) will be considered to be equivalent to the B2 level of the CEFRL. For students working in “critical languages”—or non-Western languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Ko-rean, Russian, Turkish, Urdu—the level of achievement should be the 300-level at Smith and with consultation with their adviser. International students, or students whose native language is other than English, should consult with their concentration adviser on how best to show they have attained the equivalent of a B2 level in English, the language from which they will translate.E-Portfolio Language PassportStudents will be expected to develop an e-portfolio Language Passport with the guidance of the Director of the Concentration. Students may include the fol-lowing in their e-portfolio: a detailed language self-assessment; a reflection on their language-learning; a reflection on how their practical experiences have deepened their understanding of the language and culture they are studying; a shortened version of the introduction to their final translation project.Capstone: A choice of three possibilities:1. An independent translation project (10 pages minimum, depending on the type of translation) with a substantial introduction that reflects on the ob-stacles, difficulties and successes of the task of translation.2. An extra translation project within the context of an existing seminar or 300-level course in the language or culture of the student’s translation focus. (If students choose this option, the course will be in addition to the other four academic courses required for the concentration.)3. An Honors thesis that is a translation project or reflects on translation.Whichever of the three options the student chooses for the capstone, she will consult with her concentrator adviser.

Subjects that belong today to separate academic disci-plines were rarely so separated in the Middle Ages, and it is therefore appropriate that students be given an opportunity to bring these subjects together again. The great diversity of regional cultures in medieval Europe was balanced by a con-scious attempt to hold to a unified view of the world that embraced religious and social ideals, Latin and vernacular literature, and music and the visual arts.The medieval studies major and minor provide students with an opportunity to re-create for themselves, through courses in a variety of related disciplines, an un-derstanding of the unity and of the diversity of European civilization in the Middle Ages. The medieval studies major and minor are designed so that they can form valuable complements to a major or minor in one of the participating departments.The MajorLatin Requirement:All medieval studies majors are expected to achieve a working knowledge of the Latin language. This requirement may be satisfied by taking at least one Latin course (4 credits) at the 200 level or above. If a student has no prior Latin or is insufficiently prepared for a 200-level course, she will take Latin 100d (8 credits) in order to fulfill this requirement. However, all students are urged to continue Latin at the 200 level. A biblical or Koranic language (Greek, Hebrew, Arabic) can substitute for Latin with permission of the adviser. The student must pursue the classical or scriptural form of the language, not modern Greek, Hebrew or Arabic.
