* when running pytest in any directory that isn't tests, it will complain and refuse to run - I think this is due to a missing __init__.py
	~ pytest complains that there is no module named (in this case) 'punct_split'
* when running on some computers, spacy can't load 'en'
	~ only seemed to happen on windows, but it also happened on ubuntu 18.04
	$ fixed when we switch the load command to be 'spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")'
* the previous reintroduce spaces implementation did not work, so I have cleanXML do nothing related to reintroduce_spaces until we can get this fixed
	$ frankie & marius worked together, and now the wordninja implementation is fixed
* in the current script (as of today), when I add brown to the wn_colleges list, it takes substanially longer to run than it would other wise
