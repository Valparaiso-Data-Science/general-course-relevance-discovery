Fall 2022 To Dos:

Front End: (courseFinder)
* Page layout is reliant on user knowing how to navigate so automatic renders to the next page school form->catalog form->index page would be good
* On the index page:
	- make the Catalog dropdown menu dependant on the School selected
	- make data entered more stict, ie only being able to uplaod a XML
	- hide results link until request has been processed
	- show some sort of loading screen or indication to the user that the code is still running
	- "request type" was planned and used in the request form, but not used
* Email results to user as well as rendering on results.html
* Styling the HTML pages
* Unit testing for the website

Back End: (tripodscode)
* source/ code outputs empty csv on certain XMLs, like smith 2018. this was not an issue in spring 2021
* Ideally users would be able to upload a PDF and Grobid would convert it to an XML
* In views.py index():
	- make the tripods code run not based on system calls?
* In punct_split.py:
	- the enchant library is not easily available for M1+ Macs, consider nltk library instead? the code is removed for now
	- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3788870how-to-check-if-a-word-is-an-english-word-with-python 
	- https://github.com/pyenchant/pyenchant/issues/265 

* Continue to clean up the source folder, maybe functionalize main in the way analysis/main.py is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Previous To Dos:
* refactor parse.py - multiple different things that we could do, it'd be good to start with looking at the regex for courses (make the checks into a function (like 'isACourseID'))

* as a subdirectory. and move bok.txt to data/ aswell. there are only a few lines in total that we would need to change

* change the git clone command in the docker image to be 'git clone --depth 1 <url>' to improve the speed at which the docker file is made? The most time consuming process of creating the image is downloading the repo.
	$ not a good solution, if you run git pull, you download the repo's entire git history

* work on documentation and commenting our code
	$ most code now has comments
